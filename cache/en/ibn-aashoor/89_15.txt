The Quranic researcher (P-324), as for the human being, if his Lord is afflicted with him, he will be honored and blessed with him, so my Lord will say, and if he is born, he will be able to do it.).The fulfillment indicated that the existing words after it are connected to what was before it and the separation of it, not a condition.And it indicated (either) in the sense: what is of anything, and that is the origin of its meaning and the necessity Burning and light, and he was broken with his with him, as it was the one that was so far.He was deducted on the description of what the nations were enjoyed by the representative of what God has blessed with it from the blessings and they are the ones who are not for the sake of the Messenger of God Their Lord, who are the ones who are forbidden, who were forbidden, and they are ruminated, and they are admired with their greatness In the world with the abuse of the lesson, and it is the reminder of the partners that their condition is similar to the case of those of those who are nourished, overwhelmed and drunk, and alerted them to their mistakes, if it was from their sins, if it was from the state of their sins, if it was the same, if it was the case Limbon, which they were delusional that God made them a place of dignity, and they calculated that the warning of the Messenger ﷺ ﷺ ﷺ to them with torment is not sincere because it is not a matter of what he is in the authority of what is the one who violates the one who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a matter of what he is.So they understood that the action of God with them was evidenced by their honor for him, which is what the Messenger is told by ﷺ that God commanded them to violate what they are, and this is what they are, Another world that is contrary to it, and shorten the gift of God on what his servants have in this worldly life, so this delusion was a Messenger of them, and they are from what they are from what The believers are of reward in the hereafter, and they restricted the reward of goodness in the richness and grace, and they shorten the badness of the badness of the competence and the abundance of livelihood.And it was repeated in the Qur’an to be exposed to the abuse of that as his saying: (They calculate that we extend them with money and sons [the believers: 55] We have a rushing in the goodness of the good..This illusion may be included in the origins of which the denials of the part in the hereafter, the denial of the second life, and the delusions of the inhabitants.(P-325) The flag of the separation is connected to a sentence (your Lord is on the observation [dawn: 14]) with the general of the general one that is required of it.The meaning: This is the matter of your servant, on his knowledge and wisdom.As for the disbelieving man, the disagreement of that is, as it calculates that what he receives from the grace and capacity in the world is a crime of God for him, and what he receives is from his life.This delusion is obligated to think that the actions of God are a raid on the other After the harm of his touch, they would say this to me, and I do not think the hour is a standing, and if I was returned to my Lord, I have a good time for me, so let us say that those who are.Let us give them from a heavy torment [Chapter: 50]).So God knows his Messenger ﷺ with the truth, and alerted them to avoid the elimination of the signs of the sublime, and to avoid the mimic of the mouths, and the stories of the mouth, The worldly symptoms are the symptoms of the long and the shortness, and in all of that it is the heroes of the people of the people of the evil and their shadow, which was dominated by the people of the ignorance, The naps in the family of Gasan, who were not partners and they were extended in support: They calculate the good, not evil after it ∗∗∗ and they do not calculate evil, a beaten, and God has followed that with deterrence and the abuse of his saying: The two sayings; Because they were shocked by falsehood and a lost suspicion, as he will know him when he said: (So he honors it and blesses it).And the confirmation of the verse on the abuse of livelihood in the metaphor of the grace without that of this from the heart and pests; Because the most part of the partners who talk to them is the authenticity of the mood and the power of the eternity, so they will only be killed or a ritual in them and in their vicinity, he said: What the Harma (P-326) does not look at you, and the most interpreters are not promoted to the two systems of the verse and its connection with what was before it, but the time.This is a sign of the straying of the people of the people of the ignorance.I became a lot of money and toured me, Banoun, a drama that is shed for the supplies, and made this vanity a measure of the people of the people, so they made the people of the people of the people, And they were silent with the deficiency of the people of the conjunction and the exempting of people, so when the mill came from Quraysh and from the children of Tamim and a visa to the Prophet ﷺ and he has a mother, and a mother, Abi Hudhafah, and a sacrifice of Mawla, and a lustful, in other people who have been exempt from the believers.And they said to my father, a student: If your nephew was the same as the worship and the Halbaf, the greatest of him was in our breasts and was given to us.In that, the Almighty said: (And those who call their Lord [Al -Anam: 52]) and the verse as it is presented in the Surah of Anam.So God warned about their mistakes with the occasion of the same remembrance of what the nations have met before them, who was obligated to the torment of the torment of them, It is taken originally in the adoption of the penalty on the work, and that the expensive penalty is the part of the Day of Resurrection.What is meant by the human being And its definition of the purpose of the gender, so the people of gender are used, but it is an exploitation of a well -known people who want the people who are involved, because they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the most The most likely in the release of the human being in the Qur’an descending with the makkah as his saying: (The human being does not seek to see him asking for [Al -Alaq: 6]) ( 3]) (We have created the human being in a luxury [Al -Balad: 4] What is the reason that no one will be appreciated [Al -Balad: 5]) and then.This is indicated by the Almighty saying: (Then the human being remembers and that I have the male [Al -Fajr: 23]) The verse.It was said: I want a specific person, and it was said: Aatta ibn Rabia, or Abu Hudhafah ibn al -Mughira from Ibn Abbas, and it was said: Amy of Bin Bin, It was said: Abi Bin Khalaf from Al -Kalbi as well.Rather, these are the flags of misleading.Ibn Attiyah said: From (P-327), where this was predominantly over the infidels, the tuber came in this verse in the name of the gender, as it falls (such).He knew that it is a misguidance of the people of the polytheism and from the temptation of the Satan for some of the sacrifice of the believers to imagine what he will be made to one of the people of God And what is the reason for it, so they put what is against the benefit of one of them from the tester, the position of dignity from God, for whom it is accompanied.The breath and the shame of the unseen and the fragments of God, and if one of them follows from the animations, what was lost to him by harm, imagining him with his accusation of his intention of God.So, those who claimed what they have received from the grace of God, as God, to them, are not a family of the honor of God.These are the ones who were deluded from the abundance of livelihood, insulting from God, and they are not degraded with God from those who claimed that God is what they are.That is the need, and it is necessary to exaggerate the people of the polytheism in their traps and disagree with their attention from the displacement when it violates that, and perhaps the slave of the whim For some exemption of faith, the shortest of the eyes and the ignorance of the right to the right, as Ahmad ibn al -Rawandi elaborated on the ease A sane person whose doctrine was appointed ∗∗∗ and ignorant ignorant, which he met with a meantic, ؎ This is the one who left the understanding bewildered ∗∗∗ and the scholar is in the freezer, and this is not the same The facts are from its evidence, and they dispersed them from the displacement, while its owner will be pleased with the consent of God and what is happening in his anger, and the knowledge of God is wide and his fragments of all of them, and all of them are all They surround something of his knowledge, except with what he wants [Al -Baqarah: 255]) The harm to the servant comes from several reasons, and the benefit may come from the last.And some of that is a neighbor in (P-328) The accustomed, and there is what is in the name of the habit, so that the invasions came from the faces of the benefits, and the consequence is awakened by the Emirates, he said: (So what do you think of what they have.On the gates of everything, even if they rejoice in what they have taken, we took them as a sudden, then if they are dressed [Al -Anam: 44]) and he said: (And what we sent in a village from a Prophet, but he took it And the harm perhaps they will be buried [Al -A'raf: 94] Then we have changed the place of the good, until they pardon They feel [Al -A'raf: 95]) and said: (First, they see that they are fascinated every year once or two times, then they will not repent, nor are they remembering [At -Tawbah: 126]).And the actions of God are similar, some of which are indicated by his goal of people, and some of them are running over the world’s regime, and all of his destiny has been destroyed and destroyed by his knowledge Its causes with its causes, virtual, or by the mediation, and the insightful, takes the surgery to himself and his people, and he does not say to God, and he does not say to God His evidence, and delegates what he has formed to know the knowledge of God.Likewise, this is the one who is the one who is the Muslims who are guided by the prophet ﷺ and those who are visible in the paths of the Rabbani.And we have found some of the people and those who liken them from the heedless people from the miracles of the people of the ignorance to find the imaginations that they dictate to their minds, and they are obligated to do so With the preaching of God in this verse.There is no crime that God has accelerated the reward of good for some of the righteous of His worshipers as he said: (Whoever does good is a male or a female who is a believer, so let him be a believer).He may hurry the punishment for those who are angry with him from his servants.It was narrated from Noah, his saying to his people: (I said, forgive your Lord, that he was forgiving [Noah: 10] He sends the sky on you with a righteous [Noah: 11] 12) He said: (And if they were righteous on the way, we would have given them a good water [Al -Jin: 16]).And for this treatment is signs that it appears to run on the disagreement of the idols as we see in the victory of the Prophet ﷺ and the successor to the great nations of the murmur, and that is the dates Or a feast of it, which will be fulfilled by his right.And the ritual (either) is a separation in the majority, that is: it indicates a metaphor between two things of self and loudness.Therefore, it has been repeated in the words, so the detail is not beneficial from it in the sense of two beautiful evidences before it, but it is a separation, an interlocutor, and a bond, and it is a scandal, and it is a scandal (P-329) The detail that comes to him (either), so that the detailing of the previous words is beneficial from the fulfillment of the interior on (either), but it is related to what is related to what is related to what is related With its establishment, it is not separated by a summary.The detailed here is the ignorant human being It was separated to his condition in the reduction and the heresy, and its condition in the thickness and the intensity, so the balance between the two cases expressing them with the two of them in his saying: Etc., and in his saying: (As for if they are trapped, he is able to live him), etc.This detail is not before the arrival of the beautiful, but it is a distinction and a separation between two things or the things that you suspect or mix.The remembrance of (either) may be presented with the words of the Almighty: (As for those who believe, they know that the truth is from their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 26]) The verse in Surah.And Al -Wasli: Construction and be good and harmful; Because in both of them, they are forced to the souls of the soul, the creation of patience and patience, the Almighty said: (And we will give you evil and goodness.[The Prophets: 35]) Worsen, and it falls in two states, a satisfactory state and a condition other than a satisfactory, and also the provision of livelihood is a period that requires two states as well.The Almighty said: (Let me give me the most disbelief [ants: 40]) And he said: (And we will give you evil and goodness.The verse in the two meanings.And the meaning: If his Lord makes what he receives from the grace or from the abstraction, it is an appearance of his condition in thank you and the infidels, and in the patience and the reward, it is that God is not.And the honor: The Raghib said: “To connect to the human being, and it is a benefit that does not follow in it a shame or a humiliation, and that it makes what is connected to it.Cross [Al -Anbiya: 26]), that is: He made them as a dignity.Ah.He wants to give the generosity to give the crime and call the thing that is generous in his lord, so he will believe his saying: (So be sure) An unparalleled benefit in it, or by making an honorable master.And his saying: (So I will be honored) from the first meaning of the honor, and his saying: (So my Lord says, "from the second meaning of him in the words of the ritual, and he knows that) In that God is blessed with the disbelievers, awakening to them and treating mercy, and who are fulfilled from (P-330) who are speaking that the infidel is a blessing in the one who is in the authority Al -Matridi and Al -Bagnani.This is what the Ash'ari and the Matridi were disappeared, and the successor is noticeable.And the meaning of (we are blessed) made it in a grace, that is: in good life.And the meaning of (he was able to live with him), he gave it with limited destiny, and it is a stability with the noble metaphor for the significance of the sign The sustenance, the Almighty said: (And if God has simplified the sustenance for His worshipers, they wanted to the earth, but it will be revealed as much as it is to follow [Al -Shura: 27]).And distraction in (his livelihood) is permissible to return to the human being from adding the source to the verb, and it is permissible to return To (his Lord) from adding the source to his actor.And insult: the treatment is humiliation, which is humiliation.And the chain of transmission (so he honored him and blessed him) and (he was able to provide him with him) to the Lord Almighty; Because the dignity and the grace have been drawn to the human being or the coordination of it, the ability of the provision with the reasons for making God and his Sunnah in this life of the world with what is approved by the one who is in the face of the bit of the people, The comparison is between the facts of this suffering and among those who fall into it from people in its expense and its occasions.And the saying is used in its truth, which is the spoke, but the person speaks to a belief.The meaning: So my Lord says, "I am honest, and he says: My Lord insults me, and he believes that; Because they do not deviate from the choice of the blessing, or they complain about distress and need, and the counterpart of the use of the saying, this recovery is what he said: There is no way on us in the illiterate [Al -Imran: 75]) That is: they are lost, so they said it and apologized to it for themselves to themselves among the people of their mill.And I am present (my Lord) on the verb of (Exclusive) and the verb (insulting me), without saying: My Lord, or insulted me, my Lord, to intend to say that the ruling is: It is not hesitant.And Juman (and he says) in Al -Mawadahin is two answers to (either) the first and second, that is: the saying of the human being is the same as the word, the whenever it is obtained for it, the whenever it is.Glorious.(P-331) The verb that is harmed in the two answers was rejected to benefit from that saying and renewed it as the two policemen will happen.And the ritual of (all) is a dazzling of the saying of the human (my Lord, October), when the grace of the blessing, and his saying: (My Lord insults me) when he gets his hearts The code of deterrent is both sayings; Because every saying of them is a falsehood of falsehood, that is, the state of man is not in this worldly life, indicative of his house, with God, With the way that God has guided to the mediation of His messengers and his parts, the Almighty said: (Say: Do we tell you about the loss of people [Al -Kahf: 103] They calculate that they are good manufacturing [the cave: 104]) to his saying: (We do not evaluate them on the day of resurrection and adultery [the cave: 105]) in the surah of the cave.The Lord of a man in a grace in the world is a slander against it, and the Lord of the most dorned of the parcels with the doors, if he was divided into God, will be righteous.The codes of the deterrence make the year a mark on the will of God, to honor the blessing upon Him and make the stability a mark on the will of insult, and the absence of the rituals of the authority and the rituals of the rituals; Because God insulted the infidel of the torment of the hereafter, and if he wanted to insult him in the world for the sake of infidelity, all the infidelity insulted the provision of sustenance.In this way, it appeared that there is no contradiction between the proof That is by saying: (all); Because the heroes are and respond to what the human being intended by saying: (My Lord is permeable) that what he has received from the grace is a mark on the pleasure of God.The meaning is that God's affiliation has in his dealings in this world as secrets and the highest that is not surrounded by it, and that the people of ignorance are isolated from the realization of its secret with the sake, Enemy, and that the first one has to ask the truths from its mental evidence, and to know the intention of God from his life to His messengers.And to warn that they deviate from the evidence for its signs, and that they will produce the vocals other than its origins.As for the people of science, they put things on their positions, and they are touched by the sedimentary to the guidance, and they are not mixed and they are not mixed.(P-332) Nafaa, Ibn Katheer, and Abu Amr (Rabi) read in Al-Mawdahin with the opening of the yaa, and the rest of the people read its inhabitants.And the jams read (and he was able to reduce the significance, and Ibn Amir and Abu Jaafar read it by tightening the sign.Nafaa read (Akraman, and Awnan) with a water after the noun in the connection and by deleting it in standing.And they read them as a lot in the connection and stand, and they read them Ibn Amir, Asam, Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i, and Jacob Bedouin, J in Al -Wasl, and Al -Wafq.Withon, after the two years, there is no contradiction between the narration and the drawing of the Qur’an.And (all) is a deterrent from this saying, that is: God does not seek the human being and the abstraction of livelihood, caused by the will of God, to be honored by the human being.This is a beautiful deterrent that did not expose the Qur’an to show it a confessing with the same conditions of the three nations in their blessings with his saying: His saying: (And your Lord has a slave to them [Al -Fajr: 13]).
