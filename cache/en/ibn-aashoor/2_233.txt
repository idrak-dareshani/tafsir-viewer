The Quranic researcher (P-429) and the parents are breastfed by their children for all two for those who wanted to be breastfed and on the birth of his livelihood, and they are not.The same thing is that it is not the same and the mother is in her child, nor is he born in his son and on the heir, like that You are subjected to your children, so do not wipe upon you if you are delivered by what you have come to the well -known and fear God and know that God is what you do with the sake of the rulings of the rulings of the rulings and the rulings of the rulings of the rulings and the rulings It is when it was forbidden, and some of the divorced women were born in breastfeeding, and it is impossible for them to be a breastfeeding woman; Because that may be harmful to the children, and reduce the desire of marriage in them, that situation was a dispute between the fathers and the mothers, so this is the most important of the people of the That is, if the matter of breastfeeding is important, because it has the life of the human being, and because it is one of the most important affairs of the provisions of the family.He knew that I was used by the suffering of this verse from the most part of what was presented to the interpreters.The sentence and the parents are breastfed by a sentence on a sentence.And the parents are general, because it is a group known to the pain, and it is here that is intended for the mother of the parents from the divorcees of the cows of the context of the verse that he said before it With themselves three readers [Al -Baqarah: 228] and that was the arrival of this sentence with kindness to the significance of the union of the context, so he said: Among the divorced women from the past, that is, the divorced divorces have children in the age of breastfeeding, and the evidence of specialization is that the disagreement is in the period Unless after the parting, it does not fall into the case of infallibility; For from the habit known to the Arabs and the greatest of the nations, the mothers are browning their children in the period of infallibility, and that they do not refrain from those who are not forbidden With a new husband, after the parting of the groan child; The breastfeeding woman does not want to fight in it; Because she works with her groove from her husband in many conditions.(P-430) A sentence is browning a news that is intended for legislation, and the evidence of the right to investigate, and not in the sense of the matter of the mother and the positives to them; Because he has mentioned after the rulings of divorced women, and because he was punished by his saying, and if you wanted to be subjected to, then the guerrilla is inclusive of the fathers and mothers, the face of the faces, the face of the faces, the face of the faces, It comes, so there is no significance in the verse on the positive of the boy's breastfeeding on his mother, but it indicates that this is a right for it, and it was stated in that in the surah of the divorce, and it is the one who said it The last of it was subjected to it [Divorce: 6] Because he commented on his saying, and on his loyalty, they have their livelihoods and their fractures with the well -being, and that is the reward of breastfeeding, and the zouzah in the grace is not to be a goodness For the sake of breastfeeding, but for the sake of the infallibility.And their children said it was stated in the effective, with his knowledge, a gesture to the truth of the parents with that and to their desire for them; Because in his saying, they are in their words, and they are in the interests of tenderness and compassion, so this interpretation, and it is the appearance of the verse, and who has the authority of the authority of the authority: For the sake of breastfeeding the divorced woman, then if the divorced woman is breastfed by her son, then she is first in him, whether she was with a reward or a reward for you, and the reward of it was like that Malik: If the father finds someone who is breastfed for him other than the mother with a reward, and less than the reward of the example, it is not obligatory to that, as we will show it, and from the scholars of the scholars, the scholars of the scholar Whether it is in the infallibility, or after the divorce as in the murder, and the good and the appearance of the words of Ibn al -Faris in the rulings of the Qur’an: that this is the saying of your money.Ibn Rashid said in the Bayan and Al -Tashail: His saying is up to the loyalty and the parents are breastfed by their children.To your money, and for that, Ibn Attiyah said: His saying is browning with the news that the matter is on the duty of some of the parents, and the matter of scarring and the abundance of them Al -Baydawi: In this, the form of the form of the matter in the blessed destiny, and it is divorced, and there is no reason for it.It is clear that the ruling of the mother’s breastfeeding woman in the infallibility is inferred for him without this verse, and what is indicated that the good and the mother of the mother are not in the heart of the mother The loyalty has their livelihood, because the fare of the fate is for the one who is in the interest.And the revelation in the words of the Arabs: the public, and it is derived from the conversion of the round of the moon or the sun in its king from the principle of it.The period that is between the principle and the return is called.(P-431) And about the Arabs is a moon, and so, Islam has approved it.And described the two years in two gambling, a certainty to raise the illusion that the meter is about and some second; Because the release of the triangle and the collection, in the homeland and the teeth, on some of the indulgences, a great release at the Arab The second, as it passed in the saying of the pilgrimage, is a well -known famous.And his saying to those who wanted to be breastfed, he said in the scout: Bayan is for those who directed the judgment to him as his saying: He is for you, for you are for you, for you, for the sake of this He wanted to be breastfed, which is a starting and deleted news, as he referred to it, with the ability of this judgment to those who wanted.He said Al -Tafizani: And this beginner may be made in some of the actions as his saying that is the Almighty to those who fear you from you [women: 25] Its status, from the guardian of Al -Ridaa, and his incubator and the meaning: that this judgment is entitled to those who want to complete breastfeeding, and his father is the other, so if they want to do so, they will be done Say it, if you want a separation of the verse.And God made breastfeeding around two, nurturing them for their maximum period in which the rolls need breastfeeding, if he is offered to him what is required to increase the increase In his development, what is reconciled to him after, and when the two parents are in the period of breastfeeding, it does not arise except from the disagreement of the view in the need of the mood of the ritual, to the increase For those who called for the increase, until the memorization of the child.The nations have been in the juices of the lack of experience, and the numbers of medicines, they do not guide what the kind of breastfeeding is the place of breastfeeding; Because if they were treacherous, they gave him the food, and it was mixed with some kindness in need of the development of breastfeeding, so that the fate is on the authority of the food.In our era, the medicine is the good of the Sabbaths, they are in the manufacturer, and they are with that, with that they are unanimously, that I do not reconcile with the sake of his mother, whoever is from his mother Or the milk was not the same as the parts of which the parts of the children are fed, and because the manufacturer breastfeeding arises to the excess of a caution in the peace of the coffee: And his veneration.And the country of the Arabs is the hardship of the year in the majority of the Sunnah; And they did not improve the memorizers of their feeding from the reluctance of the abundant, as the weaning of the children in the year or what is close to it is the one who runs the harms of the ritual, (P-432) And to be mixed in that effect as well.On the authority of Ibn Abbas, that the one who is in place for the son who is the one who stays in the stomach of his mother is six months.A month, and so by the increase in every month in the stomach, a month of breastfeeding is shortened.Until the period of lambs and breastfeeding are thirty months; To say it to the Almighty, his pregnancy, and his thirty -month, [Al -Ahqaf: 15], and in this saying it is devoted to the storytelling of the conditions of moods; Because, in the category of what is decreased in the stomach, the duration of its mood is decreased.And the gathering is in this way, and that the two years are an end to breastfeeding every birth.And they took from the verse that the arrogant breastfeeding is what was in the two years, and that after them there is no need for me, so his request is not answered.He expressed the father of the mother to him, nods that he is true to this judgment; Because the benefits of the child are successful to him, and he is subsequently attached to him and is concentrated with him in the tribe, according to the deduction of the nations, so it is the forefront With its livelihood, and the evaluation of its means.Al -Qazza: Al -Naqfa, Al -Kassawah: Dress, and Al -Maarouf: What is dispersed by their lords, and what is not shame in the father.And what is meant by the status and the lazy here is what the breastfeeding woman takes, a reward for her breastfeeding, from food and dress because they were making the preferences, and the ritual, and the ritual Their rents; If the Arabs were not more doves, the people of gold and silver, but they were treated with things, and the rewards did not want the dirhams and the dinar, but rather they are asking.Their warnings, which are food and eclipse, and for that God referred them to their ability on the known one of them from the paths of the people and their capacity, and he is punished by the saying Its expansion and a phrase: it does not cost a soul except its capacity - to his saying: There is no birth in his son, who is infected between a sentence and a sentence and a sentence on the one A sentence that does not cost a soul except its capacity is an uplifting of its saying by the well Great assets for project and the regime.And the cost is an active: in the sense of making it a cost, and the cost: the hardship, and the cost: the exposure to what is in it is a hardship, and the release of the matter is called the matter Class, and it is a new jump.Wind, by the wow, the energy, and the origin of the expansion of the thing, if it passes it, and nothing remains from it, and it is against the narrowness of it.The user, and its origin is a slogan; (P-433) Because the time is essentially mentioned this meaning in the metaphor, as if they likened the soul to carry the work of hardship with the expansion of the custodian, for the sake of what is not for the sake of what they needed for the sake That is only when the view is deluded that it does not help it, so whoever is redeemed for the slave of the severity of the element.So, if it is broken by waw, it is a verb in the sense of a liar, and if it is in its aspiration, it is a source like righteousness and the righteousness, with the meaning of it.A source, as well as in the sense of the effective, such as creation and desert.And the cost is on the authority of the energy.And the work of the act of the deputy: to delete the actor, and the deletion of the general actors is deleted, as it is beneficial to the fall of the soul, and it is a denial in the ritual of the nose, The first is a verb that costs: it is the cost of the cost, and it is beneficial to the omission of the exaltation in its saying, except for its expansion, the general verb, the second is the verb, and the rulings are The cost of it, that is, it does not cost anyone a soul except its capacity, and that is a legitimacy from God for the nation that no one is to be assigned to anyone, except for what is in what is possible God is that it is not assigned to Islamic legitimacy except with what is deducted: in the public, and the private, so he said in the verses of the end of this surah, God does not cost a soul.[286] And the verse indicates that the incident is unbearable, in the project of Islam, and the separation of this question will come when the saying of it is not the same [Al -Baqarah: 286] In the last of the Surah.A sentence that does not harm the mother with her son is a second symptom, and it was not overlooked before it is alerting it to itself that it is an integrity of itself, for it is a legitimacy, and it is not possible.It is in the sentence before it, but it is like the separation of a sentence that does not cost a soul except its capacity; Because the insertion of harm to anyone, due to what is a part of it, almost comes out of the energy of the human being; Because the damage is narrowed by the energy, and it is the reason for those who watch it to be a more painful benefit on the soul, so it was more severe.Therefore, the mother’s pronouncement is made here, without the mother: as he came in his saying, they are browning their children, and so is the saying in his son, and this is in his son.The conditions are from a dance, or the inhabitants of a sheep, as it is like a tuning, and it is forbidden for them to cost one of them what is above his energy, and he takes advantage of what he knows from the one who knows what he knows He has a darkening for him to embarrass him, and division on him.“ She throws her son to him, and does not find someone who is breastfed, and he has no one from her and her son, and she loves to breastfeed him.It supports what we mentioned.It was said: The Ba in his saying in her son and his son is the adhesion of the adhesion, and it is for an aggression that is harmed.The origin of the harm, and the meaning becomes: the mother does not harm her child, nor the loyalty to him, his son, that is, no one of the two parents is his cursing and his burning in his heart Other than the abuse of what is concerned with the breastfeeding of the mother, and she will be in subjugation, other than the mother, to be brought to the mother to harm and this is one of the types of deviation.And read the phrase: Do not harmed the opening of the Arabs, tightening that “there is no end, and the constantness of the bound by the end and the conquest of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake The first rack of the second one to come to the second back to the reward for the conquest because it is the lighter of the movements.Ibn Katheer and Abu Omar read the raising of the Arabs that “there is no“ navigator ”and the words were informed in the sense of the end, and both readers are permissible to be a good For the reaction: Do not be confused by breaking the first rack and building it to the deputy with the appreciation of the opening of the first pioneer, and Abu Jaafar read it with the sake About him in the books of readings and publicity that he made him harmful, not harmful.Double.The scouts fell that he read the silence with the strictness of the intention of standing any procedure for the connection of the standing of the stand, and that is the assassination of the meeting.And his saying, and on the heir, is like that, he is kind to his saying, and on the birth of his livelihood, and it is not given to a sentence that does not harm, and there is no harm, and there is no harm.It came on the hearts that came to a sentence that does not cost a soul except its capacity, which is the opposite between the rulings, not a referral for the sake His saying with the well -being, and when a sentence came, it does not harm the kindness of the kindness of our knowledge that it is a second exile from what was before it, then the domination of the rulings, and the rulings of the rulings, and the rulings of the rulings The compassion of the incompatible exiles came with the third sentence with the method of navigational.The right of the heir is the one who becomes the money of the house after the death of the right to inherit.Referring to his saying (that) to the advanced judgment, which is the sustenance and the eclipse in the categories of the entry of it to which the indication of it is an enemy of the saying They are their livelihoods to be “that” referring to the forbidding of the harmful harm (P-435) from his saying that it is not a harmful and a mother in her son as he comes, while he came to me, while he came from Because when the actor was deleted and the verb judgment in the end of the end, as it is in the context of the negation, it is known that all the harm is forbidden from it, whatever it is, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from it It does not improve the expressing of it with the word “on” who is the form of commitment and the positive, that the appearance of the example is the same as the same as the same and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Judgment is prohibition.It was known from the name of the out of the supplications on the spending and the crime that the one who was on him died, and this is a summary.The meaning: If the birth dies for him, then he will inherit it, like what he was on, then “on” the lapse after the letter of compassion here is the appearance of it that it is like that To him.It is clear that what is meant is the inheritance of the father, and the “no” is a mobilization of the added as it is the affair in the entry of ”the“ on a name other than the arrogance and no exaggeration of the bond of the soul and it is the same After a name, it is reconciled to it to be added to it as he said, "And when he said, we would not have come to benefit from the advice [Al -Alaq: 15].Holding [Al -Naziqat: 40], that is, it is forbidden.Paradise is his mouths, and the saying of one of the hadiths of the mother of a cultivation “Zaji: touch is a rabbit and the wind is the wind It is reconciled to be and inheritance on the destruction of the death of others; Because the name of the actor is called in the case that there is no consciousness on its dispute, so what he said and on the heir, unless the words are based on the truth in this man The dead, otherwise he said: And on the relatives or the guardians, like that, it is a word that is sure then; Because it is forbidden by the reasons mentioned before it, it was not mentioned to him a special comment; If the act is a “deleted”.And the end is indicative of the prevention of every reasons that bring to the mother, as it is increasing, re -prohibiting that on the heir as we provided it as a nose.And the scholars of Islam agreed that the appearance of the verse is not intended; If he does not say the duty of the breastfeeding woman on the heir of the father, whether it was positive on the inheritance in the money that is the one that it is a woman on the inheritances of the inheritance for the gathering By facilitating, then the debt, then the commandment, and because the groaning has his luck in the money, and if it becomes money, it does not have to spend it otherwise, otherwise it was not for it, and it is not the same.The money is expanded by the money, so it is completed from his hand, and for that, they are in this chapter on the interpretation of either the interpretation of the meaning of the heir, or the referral of the reference of the sign.And the phrase said: What is meant and the inheritance of the righteous, that is, whoever died (P-436), the ritual: He was inherited.It was narrated on the authority of Umar ibn al -Khattab, Qatada, al -Saddi, al -Hasan, al -Mujahid, al -Ata, al -Ahsa`, Ibn al -Abi Lali, Abu Hanifa, and Ahmad ibn Hanbul, and it is not.On the kinship of the groan, and they are in the light of his father’s closeness, that is, if his father dies, and he does not leave money: it is obligatory to spend the custody of the relatives.On the behavior of their proximity to inheritance and running on the dispute in the inheritance of the forbidden mercy, so they see a right on the satellite, the spending of the municipality in the money They inherit it, if he left money, then it is from the obligatory sympathy, such as the religion, and the laughter and the dome of Bin Dhayb and Bashir ibn Nasr al -Qadi, Omar ibn Abd al -Aziz, said: And I want the soul of the custody.The meaning: If his father dies and leaves money, then he will spend it from his inheritance.And this is directed to say: What is the direction of the enemy from expressing the child to the transit of heir?So we answer that the father is that the father was obligated to the consensus of the custody of the money for the custody, so this is what he acquired money in his money.Because the majority of young people will not have a money that has been given to them, and this is a distant interpretation; Because the verse will have left the ruling of those who have no money.It was said: I want the generous inheritors, which is after the numbness of others, as it is in the saying of the Almighty, and we are the one who means the mother of the mother, who said: Al -Naqqa on the mother said Al -Tafazani in the explanation of the scout: This is a worry in this denomination, as it is not for our saying: The agreement is on the father and the one who remains from the father and the mother.It means that the will of the rest includes a picture of whether the rest is the father and there is no meaning for his kindness to himself with this advertisement.And in the blog about Zayd ibn Islam and Rabia: that the inheritance is the guardian of Al -Ridaa, the same as what is on the father of the muddy, this is all that the verse is a judge, not a texture, and that the referral is to him.That is the livelihood and the eclipse.A group said: Referring to its saying is like that, a return to the forbidden from the harmony.Ibn Attiyah said: It is for the owners and all his companions, the people, the Zahri, and the laughter, uh.Massam said Malik: And on the heir, like that, that is, not to harm.Ibn al -Arabi chose it that he was the original, and the Qatibi said: It means in the return to the closest of the remembrance, and Ibn Attiyah suggested that the nation did not.And they differed: Have it a livelihood and a lazy.Ah.It means the uniqueness of the verse with what is collected on its ruling and leaves what is in the dispute, and there is a interpretation that it is a bond.It was narrated by Asad ibn al-Farit on the authority of Ibn al-Qasim (P-437) on the authority of Malik.What is the copyist, and who shows him that the copyist is for her when you have a money that when God has answered for the death of it, its husband is the one who is a year of money A copy of that copying also from the heir who wants to God, when he copied and that is answered in the left of the dead.The inheritance, it has copied every right to money on the guardian of the dead.And when the interpretation that is in the blog of Sahnon is far away, for what was presented as a nose, and that what your money we have in the narration of Asad ibn al -Farah on the authority of Ibn al -Qasim The copying on the appearance of what is meant by it, and the transcription of this judgment is the gathering of the nation on the fact that there is no right to the money of the dead, after its device and the elimination of his debt, So we copied everything that was commanded by it to be paid from the money of the dead, like the commandment in his saying, the Almighty, he was written on you if you are brought to one of you For the two parents [Al -Baqarah: 180] the verse, and the same as the commandment of the wife of the wife and its agreement in the saying of the Almighty, and those who die from you and give it to the rituals of the rule And the ruling of this verse was copied from him, and that is that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “God has given all those who have the right to his right that there is no commandment for a heir.” That is a right to all inheritance, whatever they are in the sense that it is the principle of inheritance.And if the heir is carried on the one who is inherited the dead, if the dead leaves money, it means his closeness, in the sense that he must spend Ibn Qarib, then he is the one who has been.This verse has started this judgment, at the time of weakness The Muslims, to reside their regime with the rabies of their paragraphs, and the Muslims were the first of the Muslims with that approached them from the child, so he was so that he was inherited.He leaves a son, so he must be based on a statement, as the ruling of the tribe was in the ignorance, in the guarantee of their imams, and the payment of their merits, so what is the same, so that it is the same The Muslims were money, it was really on the group of Muslims, the rabies of their poor.And in the authentic hadith, “Whoever leaves all, or a loss, to me, and whoever leaves money, let him inherit it” and there is no difference between the food of the poverty and between his breastfeeding, and it is nothing but a good I wish the money.And his saying, if they wanted a separation, are kind to his saying, they will be broken by their children around two of them for those who wanted to fulfill the breastfeeding, because it is the one who is unaware, and the one who is unaware of it On the mother and the birth of him: Al -Waqiqin in the sentence before this.(P-438) and the separation: the weaning of breastfeeding, because it was separated from the breasts of his breastfeeding.And on his saying about relatives attached to the want of any will arising from the consensus, as their will may be a picture or be one of them in the soul of the matter, With fear, or persecution.And his saying, and a chaos is the source of a chair, if he asks for the advice.And the mutual is said to be derived from the indication that every one of the people who refer to what he sees as a sophistication, so this is the consultative of whom he considers, as if he is notice His origin is that he refers to the command in which the benefit is derived from the sign of the child, because the arrogant adviser is like that refers to the right and insults it for him I am on the authority of the meaning of the mobilization, and the desires said: It is a derived from the honey if it was broken, and for days, it was derived from it, so it was brought up in it He who does it is done and the words may be presented to it, when his saying is exalted, and when your Lord said to the angels, I am making in the land [Al -Baqarah: 30] His saying and their wickedness in the matter [Al -Imran: 159] in the Surah Al -Amran, and the sympathy of the synonyms of the consolidation of the young people, the affairs of the family of the family, the family of the family The righteousness is obtained by the consent.He reported his saying, so there is no wing to them [Al -Baqarah: 229] that this is permissible, and that the right to breastfeed the two years is taking into account the right of the two parents and the right of the ritual, and the right of the ritual Mixing the righteousness made the disagreement of the two parents as evidence of the sign of the need for the child to increase the breastfeeding, so he did the saying of the request of the leadership of them, as well And as a result, after that, on the separation, their symptoms were indicative of the fact that they saw in the case of the groan of what he sings about the increase, as he does not think that the domestication is on the authority of the The reconciliation of them, After their crops, as they are not hidden from them.And say it, and if you want to be subjected to your children, then there is no wing on you, you are transferred to the condition of breastfeeding, and the mother is not, if it is excused for the mother, She marries her or if that is where the fathers may be permissible, as it is presented in the preceding verse, that is, if you want to ask for breastfeeding, for your children, then do not be in your affliction, then do not Parents are to administer the number of the two parents in the nation, and the addressee is not the best of men, because he said to him, while he was before and the parents are browning their children, so they are the one who knows this.In the case of the consent of the two parents on that to the excuse of the mother, and in the case of the mother of the mother.He has learned from his saying, so there is no ward to you that the condition of consensus is the one who is intended first, because the exile of the wing is authorized to be signed, (p-439) Mawjouda, and I want the son to be shrouded from it to another breeder, for the recession of it, and they are only in terms of where it is fulfilled The child was not permissible, and the Arabs were breastfeeding for their children, not the people of honor.In the hadith and I was subjected to the sons of Saad.And the breastfeeding is the origin of the breastfeeding woman, that is, he is asked to breastfeed the child, other than his mother.That you are subjugated to your children, because the action is prepared with the age and the - the significance of the students - to the verb that is required from the verb, then the verb is not to the verb, so the verb is not to the verb, so it is not the verb, so the verb is not to the verb, so the verb is not to the verb, so the verb is not to the verb, so the verb is not to the verb, so the verb is not to the verb.One, and after that, he is prepared for him with the letters and the letters may be deleted for a lot And the delivery, and in the hadith, “I was subjected to the sons of Sa`d” and it was located in the scouts that requires that the Sunnah and the Ta’a entered the act of the aggressor to the one who is more than one And the origin of the woman is the woman, so if you say: I put it in it, it became an aggressor to two effects, and as if its face is that we are looking at the modern, if it was asked, then it was the one who wanted to ask for it So the Sun and the Tax entered it, enemy to one of the one, and it was risen, then it was risen, and if it was transcendent, then it was entered, and the one has entered, We put it in breastfeeding, and it was breastfed, and the abolition of the Qur’an, as the origin of breastfeeding is not required, neither from the child nor from the mother, and so: I succeeded, so I am asking for me The pursuit, and there is no meaning to seek the success of God, so that the look of the verb is the one who is a verb, or to the second, or to the second of the letters, we do not see that we do not.The verb is here originally, that if not for this advertisement, he would not be excused to seek the deeds of the actual act that exceeds the age and the time, which is the same He asks for his obtaining, as they want to scouts: that the forefathers of the increase will enter the deceased, not the increased, and it is buried that the forefathers of the leadership are, and it is a good time Different, it is permissible for some within it after one, and if all of it is all of it, it is the inner act.And his saying has indicated that if you want to breastfeed your children, then there is no wing to you that it is not what is meant by saying that it will be broken.The intended is the period of breastfeeding, and the breastfeeding women on the father, and the breastfeeding of the mothers, it is reluctant to what the people disagree, then the woman who is in the greatest, if it is the same Its breastfeeding is considered to be a breastfeeding woman from the righteous rights on it in the infallibility, (P-440), as it is like the condition.And the divorced woman has no right to her husband, so she is only breastfed by her choice.In the two cases, there is no objection or obligatory, such as the reward for women in the infallibility of breastfeeding for a disease, and the same as the boy's abuse of breastfeeding, if it is a feast, if it is a feast, if it is a breastfeeding, if it is a feast, if it is a feat of others It is upon him, and the woman who does not breastfeed the same and is the same.This is the saying of Malik, as the knowledge is like a condition, and that was a kin from Islam and was decided in Islam, and it was done in the words of money, in the books of the money: The parents are not the same, and that the specialist is the custom, and we followed them on that, but now I do not see that woring and I do not see your money that is baptized, because the one is allocated, because the one is allocated.A shopping for the positive of breastfeeding, as it was presented.And say it, if you are delivered, what you have come to the well -known, that is, if you hand over to the diseases, they will be deported.What is meant by the following: the reward, and the meaning of the original is a defensive; Because it is a meant, he came in the sense of reaching, and when he was originally, “if he is a custody of the future, he was included in the sense of the condition, it is not possible to be with it.And it was interpreted in the scouts, you come in the sense: You wanted to come, as he said: “If you rise up to prayer, [6] followed by his saying: If you want, if you want to be Floods are fell asleep, without prejudice or prolonged.Ibn Katheer (I came) read the reassurance of the preparation.The meaning is upon him: If you are delivered what you have come, that is, what you intended, then the time is permissible from the intention, as it said, the Almighty said: The best came to you, but the fathers of their fathers inherited it before and said it, and they fear God.And he said and know that God reminds them of that, otherwise they knew him.His counterpart may be presented.
