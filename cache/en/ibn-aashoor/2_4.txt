The Quranic researcher who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and the hereafter they are certain.He has complied with those who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3] a second sect of the primary sect, which is said by those who believe in the unseen: 3] For those who are righteous, then I have told that the Qur’an is guided by those who are righteous who believed after the evil and they are the Arabs of the people of Makkah and others They believe in the unseen because they did not believe in it when they were entrusted, he mentioned another group of those who are righteous and who are the one who believed in what is the one who believed The mission of Muhammad ﷺ then believed in Muhammad, and these are believers of the people of the book, and they are the days of the Jews who were many in the city and what is in the city and what is in the city and what is in the city and what is in the city and what is in the city of Like Abdullah Bin Salam, and some Christians like the Roman and the Dahiya of the Kalbi, and they are if they share the Muslim of the Arabs in Al -Humam and Al -Qayyim al -Qayyib If this was one of their attributes before the coming of Islam, then I mentioned to them a chapter of another, adding to what was described by the first Muslims, so the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first, so the one who is the one who is the one who is the first, so the one who is the one who is the one who is the first of the first ones, With public and special, and when they were intended to be specialized in remembrance, their kindness is obligated, and kindness is a bid, a warning of it that they are an illusion that there is no delusion that there is no delusion that there is no delusion Those who believe in what was revealed before, because this is the conclusion of the adjectives, so it is intended, so he thinks that those who believe in a blessing that has no good, and from this one who is good The believers (P-238) of the companions, and they are more beneficial and dedicated, as they were not the people of a nickname for the mission of a messenger before, so they will arise from this The delusion of returning the connection to give permission that these are another group, other than the parties who were conducted on them The first three are those who believed after a hook for the metaphor of the opposite.They will be the connections for the covenant, and he knew that those who believe in what they have been revealed before they are also whoever believes in the unseen and evaluates the prayer, and the prayer is evaluated, and the prayer is not.The prophet, and in the expression of the harms of its saying, believe in what has been revealed to you from the use of the renewal, such as what was presented in its principles, because it is the same, and that the faith of this is the same All of them specialize in them with a goodness that must be adopted, and if it is different, after that, the strength of faith, its fee and the intensity of the delicacy, then the father of the good And Abdullah Bin Salam.And the landing of the thing is coming down, and the transmission is from Al -Ali to the bottom, which is a fact in the resignation of the self from the highest On the shackles of his arms Doing the descent to advertisement, honorable and intense raises, as in his words, the Almighty has revealed to you a dress [Al -A'raf: 26] and his saying, and it is for you from the time of you.6] Because the creation of God and His giving make the will of the thing on a high -ranking side to honor it, and as for its release on the description of the description of God to the Prophet, then it is a metaphor With the chain of transmission to the revelation, it is a follower of the king's attainment, which is informed of this world, descending from the high world.For the king is a consolation of the words that are taught to be tired, or a metaphor of linguistics with the similarity of the suffering that is received to the prophet with something and he arrived from a high place, The meaning is not if the revelation was a word that the Messenger heard as the Qur’an, and it was revealed to Moses, and the prophet was described as some of the conditions of the revelation in the hadith of the authenticity It comes to me the same as the prayer of the gear, so it is separated from me, and I have come to what he said.The one who achieves its descent from the Qur’an before the descending of this verse is that the praise is the one who is the one It will be revealed because that does not need the remembrance, as it is known that the one who believes in what is revealed is that his faith is continuing with everything that comes down to the Messenger, because the Messenger is not At the beginning of the matter, if it is permissible with faith, they are safe from the increase, and so faith is when (P-239) is mixed with its hearts.Faith in what will be in the future will have the subject of the discourse, which is the other significance, so their faith in what will come down is intended from the words, and there is no significance for the sake The past is the one who is accepted in its saying, the Almighty, with what was revealed, and what was meant is what was revealed and what will be revealed as in the scouts.The landing is to the consequences of the meaning of the description, so the descending to it is an end to the descent, the most, and the origin is that it is prepared with a warfare because it is in the meaning of the meaning The book is revealed to you with the right [Al -Imran: 3] and if I want that the thing is stable when the descendant is upon him and enables him to say: “The Almighty and the peace be upon you:” [57] The two enemies are artistic in words.Then, the increase in the two of the two, without it, is said, and those who believe in you are among the people of the book, which is the same as the authority that these people were safe from what they are.Their messengers without eliminating the prohibitions that the people of their entry in Islam, such as the formation of the supplication, do not accept the copying and that it comes in the last of the time The children of Israel are saved from the families and the servants And we are like that of everything that was not descended in the preceding books, but it is from the implications or from the ponds of the interpretations, so it is an illusion of the mortality of the people of the people.Their religion and their saying to God is not the right to follow the prophet ﷺ.And his saying, and the hereafter, they depend on the kindness of a second characteristic, and it is proven by their faith in the hereafter, i.E.Their intention to do with a second life after this life, but this is this life With the remembrance of the praise among them from the rest of them, because it is the angel of piety and the fear that they have been made, and those who have been blessed with it, because this is the one who is good.The description of the righteous is beautiful, for the righteous is the reward of the reward and the punishment is the one who requires warning and thought, as the soul escapes from the punishment, and it will be blessed with the sake With the prophet ﷺ and because this is the last of the elders of the book of the Arabs in the era of the ignorance, the entrepreneurs do not depend on a second life, so they are the same They were bound by the deadness of the dead at his grave, and they left it.(P-240) And they call it the night, so that it is made between the pioneers of the evil and what they receive from the victorious ones with a hope.And the other in the terminology of the Qur’an is the last life, for the hereafter is a description of the other.And the last is a perspective in which it is intended to be seen on the feminine descriptions of the memorizer, as it is a lot of resignation and its goodness, and it is known as the one who is known.Consideration of its against it, which is the worldly life, that is, the closeness in the sense of the present, and for that it is said to her urgent, then the hereafter became a flag of prevailing over the life of the one The resurrection is to make the part of the parts.The meaning, and the hereafter, they are sure that they believe in the mission and life after death.And those who are aware of the knowledge of the view and the recipient or after a previous suspicion, and there is no doubt except in an order with a look, so it is more special than faith and the knowledge.And the desires for that, with his saying, are the Almighty, if you know the knowledge of the rituals [Al -Takbar: 5] to see the hell [reproduction: 6], and for that, they will not be called, and they are not released by God.The fierce sciences and it was said is the knowledge that does not accept the involvement and may be called the strong thinking, as it does not take place, as it does not happen that it does not think that it is not.It will be anchored to faith and knowledge.So expressing their faith in the hereafter with the subject of belief, because his material brings, feels that he is a science that has a reflection and a whims of the mind in the way of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the thought It was a hard life On the authority of the scene, according to the compatible, and the similarity that the entrepreneur and the eternity was running over its negation and referring it, it was the faith in it, and the faith was with it.It is more special than faith, because of the rituals they are based on here a suitable characteristic of the Qur’an, and those who have made the certainty and faith are the aim of making the remembrance of the remembrance of here Technical, avoiding a return to the return of those who believe after his saying, and those who believe in what has been revealed to you and in his saying, and the last of them, and the last of them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the last He is a work that is based on his worker, and it is a progress of the trusteeship with the sponsorship of the separator, and I see that in this urgency, there is a praise of these people, what is the same The believer is not to be appreciated by the beneficial one, as the meaning of the limit is not evaluated here by the fact that the meaning is that they are certain of the hereafter without the other, and the one who has the same And they explained it to benefit the confinement from this subordination and remove the confusion from its attachment to the counseling in it to its attachment to its affairs, and this is not in the case.(P-241) And his saying is that they are certain of the chain of transmission to it, provided to the actual chain of transmission to benefit the piety of the news, as it is a steadfast one for them.Al -Jalal, and if you are a discretion from its separation and the evangelization, he referred to the life of the soul, and exposed a book of Hazaqil and the people of its remembrance.In both of the two inflictions, they are inflicted on the eternal traders and a call for the degradation of their hops The prayer and Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nafil, so they did not fulfill them for the few of their number or because they are attached to the people of the book to take them from their goodness Because it is from the project of His Excellency, peace be upon him.
