The Quranic researcher (P-5) Surah Al-Baqara will say the fools of people, and what they have before their kiss The satellite of this verse is hidden from the verse that after it, because the appearance of it is that it is a news about an issue that falls in the future and that the kiss is the one who is the one in it.أوَّلِ الهِجْرَةِ بِالمَدِينَةِ, وهي اسْتِقْبالُ بَيْتِ المَقْدِسِ وأنَّ التَّوَلِّيَ عَنْها هو نَسْخُها بِاسْتِقْبالِ الكَعْبَةِ فَكانَ الشَّأْنُ أنْ يُتَرَقَّبَ طَعْنُ الطّاعِنِينَ في هَذا التَّحْوِيلِ After the copying of the copies, that is, after the verses that are transcribed to the house of the sanctuary because of what is known from their pain from the observation of the sacrifice in the way The surah is a follower, and the origin is the attachment of recitation to get off in the single surah, except that it is proven that it was delayed and recited by the advance.It is clear that what is meant by the kissed kisses is the domain of the holy house; I mean the honesty, which is before the Jews, and no one of the interpreters and the companions of the causes of the descent is healed in this that the appropriateness between it and between the verse is between it, Some of the interpreters needed to cost her.And who is based on it, I understand that the occasion of the occurrence of this verse here is a suitable occasion, which is that the verses before which the verses are disturbed in which the intelligence is disturbed by the intention of the intention and the one who is the one who is the intention He desires to have his soul, so it was a matter of saying that the partners say: What is the guardian of Muhammad and his followers of their before the ones who were on the authority Al -Kaaba with the fact that he says that he is on the religion of Ibrahim and refuses from the followers of the Judaism and Nasraniyah, so how to leave before the precedence of the imam, The indication of the preceding verses was developed to this syntax with his saying, and to God, the Levantine and the West [Al -Baqarah: 115].And say it.And you will not be satisfied with you, nor the Christians, until you follow their mill [Al -Baqarah: 120] As we mentioned it, and God has taught that from them, so he will be a messenger, and he said: The strange signed, which is that he made it after the verses that are exciting to him and before the verses (P-6) was revealed to him in the copying of the ritual of the place The side of the kaaba, so that the Qur’an in which the matter is not in the interest of the kaaba, after the article of the participants, then they will be tired of their people His kisses for the sake of our symptoms on it, so it was for the position of this verse here is the best of being able and the trustworthy of the His saying we have seen your face in the sky [Al -Baqarah: 144] verses; Because the article of the participants or its signs is before the copying of the house of the sanctuary.On the authority of the mourning of Abraham and Al -Kaaba.What is meant by foolishness: the partners, and this is indicated by his statement from the people from the people, so it was known in the terminology of the Qur’an, with the words of God.The participants, as it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, and it does not appear that what is meant by the Jews or the people of the book is that if it was for that, it was said that it was said that he said: Because their remembrance was not a close relative of the preceding verse to his saying and they are not asked [Al -Baqarah: 141] the verse.In this, we are assumed by the pride of Ibn Abbas and Al -Abrai Bin Azib and Al -Hassan that what is meant by the entrepreneurship is the one who is the one who said that it is the one who said: They are intended for the hypocrites, and they have preceded and described them with this at the beginning of the surah, so the intended person who are the ones who are dominated by the evil, and the one who will be blessed, will be blessed The saying is the eye of the one who sends the partners on it, and it was narrated from the Saddi that “the fools” here are the hypocrites.As for those who were pleased with the Jews, they have fallen into a freedom from the satellite of this verse to show that this saying is arising from the abomination That was the news of it before the hearing of the version of the kiss, because the origin is the agreement of the recitation to the descent, so how does the righteous say this.To him because they are stabbed in turning from the domination of the sanctuary of the sanctuary because it is a mosque while they were before them in the words The saying is that this verse came down after the copying of the house of the sanctuary, and they narrated that from Mujahid, and al -Bukhari narrated in the book of the prayer Israel on the authority of Abu Ishaq on the authority of Al -Baraa, “The hadith of the kissing of the kiss and he was located in it: So he said:“ The foolishness and they are the Jews, what they have before the one who said: And the Moroccan is guided by someone who will come to a straight path.He mobilized it: The Jews (P-7) had liked them, as he prayed before the house of the sanctuary and the people of the book, and when he was destroyed before the house, they were denied.And he brought it out in the book of interpretation from the way of Abi Naim from Zahir, with the same thing of these two Ziyati The second is a one of Amr ibn Khalid, because it is a Muslim, the trauma, and the women.The two leaders, so they need to be interpreted by the letter of the receipt from its saying, and the foolishness will say in the sense of investigation, not other than; That is, the fools said what they have.And the face of this verse is chapted Between her, with a compassion, he is the one who is the sympathy of the precedent verses, as it is a pure navigation that is not an answer to an estimated question.The first one is to meet the Sunnah in the sense of the future, as there is no reason for his shifting to the meaning of the past, and you have taught the preacher to the album by him before his fall from them, and he said in the scout: Before his fall, the knowledge was before it, and it is a distance from the obligatory prayer if it was signed, and that the answer is the one who is coming before the pilgrim to it.Ibn Attiyah mentioned on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he was the subject of the future, the position of the past to indicate their receptors in it, and the pride said: It is the choice.وكَأنَّ الَّذِي دَعاهم إلى ذَلِكَ أنَّهم يَنْظُرُونَ إلى أنَّ هَذا القَوْلَ وقَعَ بَعْدَ نَسْخِ اسْتِقْبالِ بَيْتِ المَقْدِسِ وأنَّ الآيَةَ نَزَلَتْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ وهَذا تَكَلُّفٌ يَنْبَغِي عَدَمُ Tawil on him, and the news of their narrators is not a dear one in the Qur’an, like his saying, and they will say who will return us [51] Their heads [Al -Israa: 51] and if the one who invited them to that was proven that they said this article before we descended this verse and that of that was for the sake It was in it, and it was in it that it was supported by what it wasid in the interpretation of its saying, and the righteous and the Maghreb [Al -Baqarah: 115] and his saying, and you will not be satisfied with you.And the fools: the collection of his shed, which is a similar adjective from his slope to the complication of fulfillment if the shed becomes a prostration and the saying is presented in the shed at the authority of the one who said: Abraham except for those who shed his soul [Al -Baqarah: 130] and their description of them that they are from the people with his being, a knowledgeable is the alert on their justice from the one who is the one who does not The people are not other than these, so if the type of human being was divided into the types of human beings, then the loyalty of the fools, then it is understood that it is not a sorry, other than the face of the face, From him, this saying is his sorry, whether the saying is Jews or the partners from the people of Mecca.(P-8) And the gathering of the group in his saying is what is given to them to the knowledge of the denomination, as it is not mentioned in the memorizer, as a story of the saying of the fools, and they want to do so In their words, he is a leader on the Muslims.The actions of their origin, his origin, are doubled, if he approached and approached, so he has the right to exceed one of the effective effects, because he said: He made it out of him and his saying of the Exalted here: What they have before their kisses and the rumors of his recovery in the words, so it is too good to delete the letters of the neighbor who is a second His enemy to a second one is a large number of widening, and they said: So and so, his face, for example, without saying that they were so and so, so that so, so that so, so that so, so and so Kill and gave and for that, they did not care about the presentation of one of the two verbs on the other hand.Because if he had been raised, he would have said that the disbelievers are the disbelievers, and he said that he said: “It is not the same”.For him, this is the realization of this action.And the sentence of what they have, etc., is the saying of the saying, the vigor of all of the gathering, which is known to be known from the place, and they are the Muslims, and they are not the same The conscience and the violation of the phenomenon in the origin of the story of the statements.And the understanding in his saying what they are consumed in the expression of error and the obligation of the mind.What is meant by kissing in his saying about them before the side that they give to them is upon them when the prayer is as it is indicated by the righteousness and the news of the righteousness.And the kiss in the origin of the formula is a name on the age of a verb with the breaking of fulfillment and the doubt of the eye, and it is the adultery of the source indicating the authority A measure of the deletion of the Sunnah and the Taa, then it was released on the thing that the future is accepted by a metaphor, and it is what is meant here because the guidance is not in the authority of the one who said: The lament of Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, is the first of those who prayed for your kiss and the appearance of me that the kiss will be the name And it is eaten by adopting the side, as they said: What he has in this matter is a kiss and there is no destination.And the addition of the kiss to the guarantee of the Muslims to the significance of the more, when it is not accepted by the nations, because the two participants did not accept it, because the two participants did not The book was not accepted in their prayers, (P-9), which is from what is assumed to hold the foolishness of the polytheists, when I would like to them, for the sake of them.As they are not satisfied with adding that kiss to the Muslims, and whoever is pleased with the Jews and is attributed to them, they will be excluded from the house The Muslims received that kiss for a period of age and a month, and it was a kiss for them.And the congregation of the collection in his saying, what is gave birth to a teacher from the denomination, other than the memory of the memorizer, as a story of the saying of the fools, and they want the guy or in the way He returned it to the Muslims.And the saying that they were on it, that is, they were bound by it, and “on“ here for the permissible homes, which is the severity of the mandate, like the saying of you, the one who is the one who is the one who is the first of you.” 5], and it is a increase in its funeral for the denial and expression; That is, how did they refrain from it, after it was necessary, and they did not take them into a truce.The migration.And I know that the Jews are coming to the house of the sanctuary, and this is not upright from the origin of their religion, because the house of the sanctuary is that it was built after the peace of the peace Peace be upon him, so do not find in the books of the fifth male to be mentioned in the way of the servant of God Almighty and prayers and supplication, but peace be upon him, but peace be upon him The house of the sanctuary, in the first travel of the first, that Solomon, when I used to build the house of the sanctuary.And his hands were simplified, and God called a supplication in which he came: If the people of Israel break in front of the enemy, then they returned and got to know, and pray, and they will come to this house, so I will return to them.For their fathers, and if the people came out of the fighting of the enemy, they prayed to the Lord, we were the city that you chose and the house that he built for your name, and he heard them, and he heard them, and he heard them.After that, God spoke to Solomon, and he said to him: I have heard your prayers and your rushing that you have been lost in front of me, and this does not indicate that the ritual of the ritual The debt of the Jews and its groceries is the indication that the jurisdiction is the same as the house of the sanctuary with the prayer and the supplication is a virtuous form, so perhaps the children of the righteousness of the time, not The sanctuary, or that their prophets, after their choices, have been given them.Ibn Abbas and Mujahid said: The Jews thought that the agreement of the Messenger has the same in the kiss, perhaps they invited him until he becomes an agreement with them in the college, The rulings of the Qur’an (P-10) on the part that the Jews were coming to the house of the sanctuary based on the words of Ibn Abbas and Mujahid, and this is not proven from this And the pride mentioned on the authority of my father in it that the Jews were accepting the destination of the Maghrib and that the Christians were accepted by the honor, and I have learned that I did not know.In their prayers, a certain side that they will accept, and that they were calling for their prayers to go to the guidance of the house of the sake of the destination They have no appointed side of the sunflower and its weirdness and what is between them, so when it is decided that, when they are delusional and the one who is delusional from them Muslims in that.As for the Christians, they did not fall into their evangelization, as it was in the matter The chapters of their people are accepted for the sunshine, where the sun is entered when it is in its appearance from the chapter on the height of the idol, the owner Reverse that and make The chapters of the people to the west, and that is the slaughter of the western and the worshipers, is accepted, and the Khafaji mentioned that the bond of the one who commanded them is the same We go down the verse, then the Christians are among the middle juices until now, so they can be left, and they will be left.The multiple in the single entity.As for the righteousness of the Kaaba in the Hanafi, it is clear that the premature of peace be upon him, when he built the Kaaba, he received it with the supplication, and when the prayer is for the prayer, then it is for the prayer.Inside it, the pharaoh does not expand from the people, and if it was built for the prayer around it, then it is the first kiss and it was placed for the prayers, its direction, and that is famous for it Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nafil: I was forbidden by what is forbidden by Abraham.So the matter of the commitment of the future in prayer is from the characteristics of this project and from the sentence of the suffering of the religion of religion as we will show it.This verse was indicated that Muslims were coming to the side, then they turned into another side, and the one who turned to the one who turned to the one who turned to the one who turns to the one who turned to the one who turns to the one who turned to the one who turns to the one The Kaaba indicated that they were accepting the sanctuary of the sanctuary, and that the effects came.And the authentic hadiths are three, the first of which is the first and its authentic: On the authority of Ibn Dinar, on the authority of Ibn Omar, “Between the people in the prayer of Al-Sabah in dirt, when he came to them, and he said that the Messenger of God (P-11) ﷺ He was revealed to him They accepted the kaaba, so they accepted it, and their faces were to the Levant, so they turned to the Kaaba.Bin Muslim and Moses bin Aqba, in which: We will go down the verse of the kissing of the kiss was before the prayer of the morning and that it was not in the prayer of the prayer For the kernel, and this hadith is the origin of the door and it is the chapter of the speech, the second of it: the hadith of a Muslim on the authority of Anas ibn Malik and in which it is: A rak'ah, so that the kiss was transmitted, and they are as they were like the kissing.Bin Azzib said, “The Messenger of God ﷺ prayed to the house of the sanctuary of six months, a month or seven ten months, and the Messenger of God was to God God Almighty, we have seen your face in the sky [Al -Baqarah: 144] So he turned the side of the kaaba, then he said, “So pray with the Prophet, then he came out, then he came out.” The supporters are in the prayer of the era.He prayed with the Messenger of God, and that he turned the side of the kaab, so the people are forbidden until they directed the rituals of the Kaaba.And the son of Malik and the remembrance of the prayer of the era in the narration of Al -Baraa is all over the people of a special place, and there are other effects that violate this, and it is not correct.So the kissing was in the righteous, two years ago The sanctuary was before the migration or after it, so the gambling is that when the prayer was imposed on him with the Mecca, he would accept the ka’ib, so the ka’m was accepted.The sanctuary is a kind to the Jews, some of them said while he was weak, and it was said that he accepted the house of the sanctuary, while he was making the heels in front of him from the part of the evil Al -Kaaba and the house of the sanctuary together, and this saying was not correct.Bouhi, then copy it by receiving the kaaba, and their evidence is the saying of the Almighty, and what made us the kiss that you were on [Al -Baqarah: 143] the verse, and the one said: The sanctuary and the choice of the house of the sanctuary, as a result of the Jews, and the good said, Ikarmah and Abu al-Aali: that was about the domestication of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace (P-12) (P-12) The saying will be the saying of the Exalted, so let us curse you before you will be satisfied [Al -Baqarah: 144] indicating that he has stressed that he saw that he followed the same before the two years of the two of the two years.It is that God commanded it to be in the way of the kaaba, so when the kisses were changed, the fools said: The Jews or the hypocrites on the contradiction of the narrators of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one They said: Muhammad's loneliness to his country and about a relative who returns to your debt, the gospel mentioned it and was attributed to the Bin Bin Uzib and Ibn Abbas and Al -Hassan, and the narration of Al -Qarabi narrated that We are among the Muslims from the Muslims, Abu Said ibn al -Ma’ali, and in the hadith weakened.It is meaning that all the flaws are both in the fact that they are parts of some of the most of the creatures, for the possessions of God are a follower of the things that occur in it, and it is not for him.To go and seek to be subjected to self -evaluation.115] And it is permissible for what is meant from the outskirts and the weirdness of all of them is that all the terminology of the people divide the land into two directions.The sun and its strangeness, and what is meant is that it is not For some of the sides, he is divided with a closeness of God, because it is a balance on the one hand, but it is his command to imitate some of the flaws of the rule, so it is like it He called in the assumption of one without the other, according to what God Almighty commands, so the Almighty said to him to God, the Mustarah and the West, Refer to the face of the face, to the face of the And his saying guides whoever creates a sign to the face of the succession of the heels to the heels on the height of it to others because his saying is guided by whoever is satisfied The Muslims are the guidance without before the Jews, except that this exposure comes to it on the way of the describing words from where it is in the saying The Mahdi of two parties who were in one case, and he is the companion that he commanded from his hand, guided by the enemy of the situation in which he shared with the other parting to the state of his brother In it a sign of the prevalence of one of the two meanings of the directed words is stronger than a verse, and that, or you, for a guidance or in a clear misguidance [Saba: 24], and he was walked in this answer to the answer.Because their denials were from a stubbornness that was not asking for the truth, so they answered what is not driven away from them, and they did not show them the rule of the tribe of the kiss, and the kiss is not.That is what the believers know.(P-13) But if we are running on the saying of those who are attributed to the Jews, they will be paid to the Maghrib side, and to the Christians, they will be excluded They interpret them that we say that the remembrance of the deceased and the West is a sign of the Christians and the kissing of the Judy, so the answer is a answer to symptoms of the path Because its grandfather is here, or it is his saying guides whoever is brought to a straight path, gesture to the way of Islam, and what is meant by the stranded is the one who is here It was presented in his saying, the exalted of the straight path [Al -Fatihah: 6], so that all guidance is included to the best, and the guidance is to be dominated by the best.A sentence guides whoever creates a state of the name of the majesty and does not improve its make it with the insult of a sentence of a sentence for the righteous and strange of
