The Quranic researcher (P-482), my children, I remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and that I preferred you over the world Their first speech to the intention of repeating to the fulfillment of this speech and what is arranged on it, for the first speech is the intent of it to remind them of the blessings of God Remembrance in order to comply with what is returned to them from God from the matter and forbidden to the tongue of his Prophet ﷺ, other than that when the exalted abuse of that was the one who is the one who is the right The eloquence is to the intended and is not prolonged in the presenter, but rather it is affected by an imam and refers to it as a wardrobe that alerts it with the initiative to the intended, the intensity They are like that of the preamble of the fiancée, and they remember him in the pretext of the minister of Andalusia, Muhammad ibn al -Khatib al -Salamman Al -Maghrib Ibn Aanan, his famous verses, whom he traded at the entry of it, his lord: ؎ The successor of God, the destiny of the curse of what he said in the dja, said: In the land of Andalus, I will not be destroyed, and they did not live.Their demands and permission to him in the rocks, so he greeted him.The judge, Abu al -Qasim al -Sharaif, said, and it was from the sentence of the benefactor.The bodies in the old were eliminating the right of its breasts to be presented, and the hypnotics were to the intended to make up for its right to care, and the return to the separation of the ritual The remembrance of the blessing is glorified for the blessing and the generosity of the blessing upon him and a preaching for him and for those who inform them of the news of that.(P-483) Let's repeat here the joke of the collection of the two words after their separation and the joke of the preparation because of what is in the meaning of the meaning of the blessing.And the blessing here is intended by all the blessings because it is an added sex, so it has the ruling of the collection as it is in the words With my covenant, I will fulfill your covenant [Al -Baqarah: 40] and his saying is up to me and that I preferred you over the two worlds.A special blessing, so I will give him a special kindness for a year, and it is a principle to prefer the blessing and its preparation, and perhaps the numbness of the blessing was from the command of the one who is a sinner Because the generous sponge is the compliance of the matter of blessing, because the blessing inherits love.Mansour Al -Warraq said: ؎ The gods will protect and you will show his love ∗∗∗ This is my life in the measurement of the sake of the sake of God if your love was true to obey it ∗∗∗ that the love is for the love Remembrance is intended by the urbanization of the slices, which is appropriate for that grace, and that is the rest of that.The meaning of the two worlds is presented with the words of the praise to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Fatihah: 2] and what is meant by it is here the creatures of the creature On the basis of the form of speaking or the smaller, the world is in the denomination of the remembrance of creation, they are the types of creatures such as humanity, animals, birds and whales.And the worlds in the denomination of the male of the misfortune of creation, the nations, or the doves, are intended by the types of those who are talking about them, so it is not a crime that the one who is intended is the one who is the world.All the nations because it is a group defined by the mother, but its generals are here a nose who is a special one who sees the nations of their time, as he specializes in the whole of the gathering of the mother His country is also elaborate with the well -known nations, as the collection of the elder who is formulated with the essential formula is made up to the form of formula The most famous of the scholars and the success of the students, for the verse indicates the precedence of the children of the two speakers or their predecessors to the nations of their era, not on some of the people who were among the people who were among the people who were among the people who were among the people who were among the people who were among the groups Like Christians, Najran, there is no relationship with him with the question that is the preference of the prophets on the angels in any way, nor the fools of what is lying in every nation or a tribe of the righteousness Every individual from the children of Israel on individuals from the nations have reached a righteous or prophecy, because the preference is like this, this is intended for it, as it is the preference It is better than slowing, even if you are in the dawn of the horse.(P-484) So, you are the one who is the sons of Israel on all nations, and in those nations a great nations such as the Arabs, the Persians, the Romans, the Hands, the Indian, the Glory And the preachers of the righteousness and the prophets because it is the preference of the group on the whole in all the pharaohs, and the meaning of this preference is that God has gathered them from the one The nations did not collect it for others, which are: the honor of the proportions.And the fullness of creation.And the peace of the contract.The capacity of the project.And freedom.And courage.And the care of God, the Almighty, in the path of their conditions.And I referred to this verse, and when Moses said to his people, O people, remember the grace of God for you, when he made you a wow and made you a loyalty and did not come to you and did not come from This is the descriptions of their ancestors at the time of their meeting, and it was common that the virtue returns to the successor with the good of the hearing, even if the addressees were not The precedence over the two worlds, but they are mentioned by what they were on, for the nations of the nations are not observed in which the individuals or the juices are noticed.He directed the increase in the description of his saying that I have been blessed with you [Al -Baqarah: 40] passed in her first sister.
