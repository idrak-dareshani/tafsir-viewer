The Quranic researcher (P-349) do not move with it for your tongue to accelerate it, if we collect it and its Qur’an, then if we read it, then follow its Qur’an, then it is for us.Infidel.And because of its descent, what Al -Bukhari narrated and a Muslim narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: The Messenger of God was ﷺ if the Qur’an was revealed to him, he will be able He wrapped from him, or from the intensity of his desire to keep him, so he would meet from that intensity, so God Almighty revealed (do not move with him for your tongue, for his tongue, for his tongue.And its Qur’an).He said: He gathered it in your chest, then we read it.When this revelation descended in the thief of the surah for the present in which he descended, and it was not an independent surah that was attached to the wall and occurred between the one.Fadir (with him) is a follower of the Qur’an as he is known in many verses.And his saying (if we read it), that is, if Jabril reads it, then the readers were given to the guarantee of the majesty on the way of the mental metaphor, and the two villages are clear.And the meaning of its Qur’an followed, that is, it listens to our readers.So the guarantee of (his Qur’an) is returned to what he returned to the guarantee of the absent in (do not move with it) and it is the Qur’an in the religious meaning, so the fall of this is the one in this is the one who is in this verse And fall (and we do not descend except with the command of your Lord [Maryam: 64]) in Surah Mariam, and fall (they preserved the prayers and the simple prayer [Al -Baqarah: 238])

takes in the readings, he will leave for him, so he will not say to him: For your tongue to hurry with it, for it is obligatory for us with the judgment of the promise, or by the judgment of the rule, that we collect your business and that we read it to you, so if it is forbidden) With the declaration, then that the path of its minds has to be the path of its minds, the lock said: This is a good face that is not in the mind what he pays, even if the effects are in the past.And I say: If the mind does not drive it, then the Arabs are the Arabs and the suffering of the righteousness.And whoever is in the position of this verse here without falling as it is before the survival of the wall before this surah: that the illumination of the Qur’an was a few.ﷺ It is not afraid of some of the verses from it, so when the fence was raised, the thirty of the thirty reaches the reaction of Said ibn Jubayr in the installation of the descent of the light, the prophet has become ﷺ He fears that some of its verses will forget, so perhaps ﷺ He took a move to his tongue with the Qur’an with the Qur’an when he is not.And that is from his kernels on the way of what was revealed to him with his text.When

arrangement, not in the time, and that (then) was sympathetic to the total of the sentence, and it did not compose it (P-351), so it is not (P-351).I want the pilgrims with the verse to be the most
