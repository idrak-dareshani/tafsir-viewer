Because the thanks of the blessing is the spontaneity of the definition of the definition of the people in the knowledge of people, and the words were released (as) the separation is that it is a separation.And when it was (either) in the sense of: and what is something, it was a horn of its answer.And (yatim) is an act of action (so do not be more lower).It was presented to the warning of his affair, and for this intention, it was not given to him, and he had obtained with that exempt with an arrest of a answer (but) that it is a matter of (but) The statements of the loyalty of the answer to the condition of the condition.And it appears that they are not the separation between (either) and its answer by providing anything from the relationship of the answer except for the will to be fulfilled by the presenter; Because it is signed (either) does not deviate from the words of the words, a conjunction that is focused on some of the parts of the words, so he (but) in the words is an effect of the insulting and it is that it is necessary that it is necessary The commentary of the sentence, so that is the one who adheres to its progress, and so is the saying in the custody of the (liquid) and the presentation of (the grace of your Lord).The three -year -olds were made by this detail with three works that it meets.It is permissible for this detail to be on the way of the roll and the arranged publishing, and that is what Al -Tayyibi was included, and he will run on the interpretation of Safyan (Bin) With the means about religion and guidance, then he said: (As for the yatim, do not be fiercely) is an interview for his saying: (Did you not find you a good time?[Al -Duha: 6]) And keep you from the symptoms of the usual shortage of my body, you were honored for the imams as a way of their companion, so he gathered that in the forbidden from his abundance; Because the people of the ignorance (P-402) were fascinating the imams, and because if it is forbidden for the annexation with the many of the reasons for its sacrifice; Because the oppression may be issued by the anxiety of the demands of his needs, then the sins of the tongue are fasting to obtain, as he said: (Do not say to them: About them, abusing a mercy from your Lord, please, say to them a good saying [Al -Israa: 28]).And the abundance: the dominance and the humiliation, which is the appropriateness here, and this is the suffering of the verb, such as bidding and grieving in the act, and it will be with the saying, and he said: And it will be by signal like the way of the face, for the abundance of which is the one who is not treated with it is not the same in that, in the same way, so the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not Construction is one of the rights of education.And his saying: (As for the questioner, do not be upset), the interview of his saying: (And find you lost, and guided [Al -Duha: 7]); Because the misguidance calls the question about the way, the scandal is considered one of the liquids of the liquids, and the liquid of the way may be exposed to the fatigue of the questioner as he said: I was his hope: I do not show you that I am busy, so God made the thank you for his guidance to the way of goodness to expand his God for the caller.The liquid does not conclude with the means of giving, but all the liquids include, and the greatest frankness of the Messenger ﷺ with the guidance of the two guidances, and this interpretation is narrated.Al -Tarmahi narrated on the authority of Abu Saeed Al -Khudayri that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “People have a follower, and that a man comes to you from the land of the earth, and they will be agreed upon, so they will come to you.Haroun Al -Abdi said: If we came to us, Abu Saeed said: He welcomed the commandment of the Messenger of God ﷺ.And the definition in (the liquid) is the definition of the sex, and every questioner is general, meaning: what the Prophet is asked ﷺ about his example.The publication will be published.If the (liquid) was interpreted with the well -known question, it was the opposite of his saying: (And he found you a family, and he enriched [Al -Duha: 8]) and he was from the disseminated publication, that is, the opponent is the one who is the one who is the opponent of The scouts.“ It is forbidden for the forbidden and the prohibited river than what is more severe than them in harm, such as insults, scabies, and seizing money, and leaving it in need, The question is in Islam.And his saying: (As for the grace of your Lord, he spoke), the meeting of his saying: (And he found you a family, then sing [Al -Duha: 8]).The singing is a blessing, so God commanded him to show the grace of God, upon him, with the hadith of it, and to declare its thanks.And what is meant by the grace of your Lord is a special blessing, but I want the sex and he will benefit a general in the rhetorical shrine, meaning: He spoke of what God has blessed with you Thank you for the grace of singing, and the matter of all the blessings of goodness so that the sentence would be a university.If his saying is made: (As for the liquid, do not be upset), he met his saying: (And he found you a family, so he enrichs [Al -Duha: 8]) on the way of the wrapping and the spread of the one who said: With the goodness of your Lord, he spoke), meet his saying: (And find you lost, and guided [Al -Duha: 7]) on the way of the thousands and the disgraced publishing as well.And what is meant by the grace of his Lord was the grace of guidance to the right religion.Hadith: the news, that is: tell what God has blessed I have a confession of its preference, and that is from the thanks.And the saying in the presentation of the bitter, which is (with the grace of your Lord) on his attachment like a saying in the Qadimim (but the yatim is not a luxury, and the question is not).And the speech is for the prophet ﷺ, so the matter is required in the three positions to be in particular with it, and the origin of the matter is the obligatory.His nation is with that, and she will be done at the origin of the nation’s equality of the nation to her Prophet, while he was imposed on him, and there was no evidence for the property, but the equality of the nation is in the mother of the mother.The liquid is a large number of what is required by the origin of equality.As for the equality of the nation in the matter by speaking with the grace of God, the blessings of God be upon his Prophet ﷺ various of it is not restored to others from the nation in it, and the name of the nation is in it.The Qur’an and the like that is the requirement of the greatest scabies, and the grace of the Lord in the verse is beautiful.(P-404) The blessings of God that he was blessed with his Prophet ﷺ a lot of it is what must be conversated with him while he is the people who are the people, and that he is a messenger, and that he is a messenger, and that he is the Messenger of God In Tabliah Al -R in, and people have learned Islam, and he says to those who address him: “To testify that there is no god but God and that I am the Messenger of God.” And among it is the definition of people, what is required of him from righteousness and obedience as his saying to whom he said to him: Justice, O Messenger of God.And he said: ““ What do you believe in me are on his life and do not believe in me?”!Oppositions; Because the prophet is infallible from the brightness of the brilliance, and the people do not think about that, and it is a steadfastness on it.As for the nation, it is a modern conversation from them, with a righteous or foolishness.This is a field to look at the opposition between the requirement and the obstacles, and the way of gathering between them if it is possible or the survival of one of them.And in the interpretation of the pride: The Commander of the Faithful was asked to me - may God be pleased with him - about the companions, so he praised them and said to him: So he told us about: God is about Zakat, so he said to him: Is God Almighty saying: (As for the grace of your Lord, he spoke?And if you are silent, I started, and among the glow is a good knowledge, then ask me.It is among the scholars who summarized the grace in his saying: (The grace of your Lord with the grace of the Qur’an and the blessing of the prophecy, and he said it is a jurisdiction.Al -Tabiri narrated it on the authority of my father.Mumun: If he meets The man is one of his brothers who trusts him, he says to him: God has gave birth to the joyful prayer such and such and such, and on the authority of Abdullah ibn al-Ghalib: that it was (p-405) Al -Barah is like this, I read such, so I prayed like that, I mentioned God like that, so we told him: O Abu Farras, if you do not say this, he said: God says: And you say: Do not speak with the grace of God.Ibn al -Arabi mentioned on the authority of Ayoub, who said: I entered my father, Rajaa Al -Attadi, and he said: God has gave God the righteous: I prayed like this and praised such, so I said: please.On the authority of some of the predecessors, that the incident of the blessing will be of trust from the brother of whom he trusts in, Ibn Al -Arabi said: The event of the work is from the work The people of trust, it is perhaps he came out to the brilliance and the misfortune of his friend.And the pride and al -Qaribbi mentioned about Al -Hasan ibn Ali: If you are good or do you do better, then speak to him from your brothers.Al -Fakhr said: However, this is good if he does not include a ray and he thought that others would pay him.* * * (P-406) (P-407) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of Al-Anarsa was called in the greatest of the bodies, and in the authenticity of Bukhari and the gathering of Al-Tarmahi.And I was called in some of the phrases “Surah Al -Sharh” and the same in some of the honorable cruises, named after the verb of the verb in which it is the one who said: Your chest [Explanation: 1]) And in some of the phrases, it is called the Surah Al -Anhar.It is an angel with agreement.The second was one of the second in the meter of the lighter, and the sacrifice of the sacrifice came down with the sacrifices and before the Surah of the era.On the authority of Tawas and Umar ibn Abd al -Aziz, they were saying: “Did we not explain from the Surah of the Duha.” And they read them with the single kneeling, which did not separate them - meaning: in the volatile prayer - and this is anomalies contrary to what the nation agreed upon.I am not eight.* * * I took the remembrance of the care of God, the Exalted for His Messenger ﷺ with the kindness of God for him and the removal of clouds and embarrassment from him, and the interpretation of what he has been forgiven, and he will be forgiven.About him, so they joined her youth that he is a pilgrimage to those who were guided by the sacrifice of the sacrifice, and I was proven to him by reminding him of his mind.Let him know that the one who started with his blessings would not have been cut off from him, and that was the way of the report in a past that the Prophet knew ﷺ.(P-408) And he followed that he is the same as he supports him, so he will find a difficulty of his command, as God bless him And he desires God to help him.
