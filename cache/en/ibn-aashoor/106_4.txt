The researcher, the Qur’an, is the Quraysh of the way of winter and the fast.The illusion and its effect on the closeness is what reconciles to attach it to it, so it is a way to be attached to this course.And the length increased it, as it was separated between it and its attachment (by opening) with five words, so he will be suspended (for Elaf) with his saying (so).And the presentation of this bitter to be offended by it, as it is one of the causes of their command in the worship of God who exposed to the worship of idols, and the boundaries are attached to them.And the origin of the word of the words: to worship the Quraysh of the Lord of this house, which he fed from hunger and believed in fear of their families to avoid the joy of the winter and the sake With the work, he turned against his workers, he was born from his presentation, meaning he made him a condition for his treatment, so he ranked his work with the fulfillment that is the one who is a matter His saying (let them worship) is authorized that what he accepted from the condition of the condition, meaning: is authorized that the work of the work is provided by the one who does not do it (P-55) It is the care of the one who is involved in its condition, and the relationship of the rest of his words is upon him because he is waiting for his answer, and this is a rape of briefing.He said in the scouts (I entered the fulfillment of the words of the condition, because the meaning is either, so let it worship it to avoid them, that is, the blessings of God is upon them, and it is not for you, so that it is not.For his good blessings, let him worship him for this one that is a phenomenon that is a phenomenon.The condition is as if it was said: It was not necessary to grow it.And the passion and its grace from the comments of the verb and the words of the Almighty are seen.In Surah Yunus, and his saying: So, he called and resigned [Al -Shura: 15] in Surah Al -Shura.” He said: So they are, and it is for me.” The admiration, it is said: it is surprising to you, and it is like a judge, and it is the saying of the commander of the measure.Its saying (let them worship) the excitement of the arrogance.He made them as a description of an eaten [Al -Fil: 5] Al -Qaribi said.Mujahid and the narration of Ibn Jabir on the authority of Ibn Abbas.Al -Zamakhshari said: This is with the home of the two joining in the poetry, which is that the meaning of the house is attached to the one who was before it, a comment that is only valid for it.They mean that this surah, and if it is a fence, is a right, it is attached to the elephant wall, so the verse is attached to a verse that has come down before it, the verse of it, which comes before it.She clung to a wall that came down before it.Elaf: the export of a thousand with two wats in the sense of a thousand and they are two languages, and the origin is a thousand, and the form of actions in it for the language; Because its origin is to indicate the verb from the two sides, then it is used to use the act of the verb, and then that is shown in some of the verbs until the verb of the verbs until the verb of the verb.He traveled, God blessed him, and God fought them.(P-556) And the fans read it in Al-Mawdahin (Laelf), after the gossip, as it reduced the second gambling.And Ibn Amir (for thousands) read it to the first one, which was the origin of the origin of which is a second prodigy, and read it (elapsed) with the afflictions of yat like the gathering.And Abu Jaafar (Laylaf Quraish) read the first gossip.And he read (their thousands) with a broken gossip from J.Ibn Attiyah and Al -Qurtubi mentioned that Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim read the investigation of the two gossip in (for thousands) and in (their thousand

the gathering in making the second of the Hamzita, so this is a weak narration from Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim.It was written in the Mushaf (their thousands) with the costume after the ham On the usual, the most likely, the readings, are narratives, and the line of the press is only like the remembrance of the reader, and the drawing of the journalist is a year -old.Let's copy the Qur’an.And adding (Elaf) to Quraysh in the sense of adding the source to its actor and deleting its verb; Because here it is called the fierce sense of that habit, it is an additive to the ability of the pain.And Quraysh: The title of the grandfather who collects many curtains, and it is the vagina of Bin Malik ibn al -Nadr ibn Kananah.This is the saying of the proportions of the two guns and what

of the name of the name of the whale is strong, which is prepared on the whales and on the ships.And some of the proportions said: The Quraysh of the title of al -Nadhar ibn Kananah.Bin Kananah, do not stand up to our mother Our Father.The pilgrimage is special, including the women.The silence of the Almighty, and it is the saying of the Almighty: Perhaps the most reasons for the causes of the heavens [Ghafir: 36] a story for the words of Pharaoh, and the saying The abundance of the bitterness and the nomadic is the brokenness of the Arabs: a name for the rituals, and it is the path from one place to another, and for that, the camel is called the one who travels to it.In addition to its time in which it is in which it is in it, the verb may be a degradation of his time, like your saying: the night of the night, and it may be a time.The appearance of the appearance, and the appearance of the addition is that the nomads of the winter and the fasting are known, and they are two spears.To show that it is not a single nomadic that begins in two times, so that they are two nomads in two times.In addition to two things, the prestige and the security of the dress, and Abu Hayyan said: This is when Sibuyah is only permissible in the harm.The division of four chapters.The whale is the whale, and its rituals are three: the grandfather, the evidence, and the whale, and the winter separated the period of the cold.Three and a few hours and a few hours, its principle is the solutions of the sun in the shedding of the Sultan and its end, the sun of the sun from the sink, and the rituals of three, And the lion, and the Nabbla.Until the richness of the richness, (means the ritualization of the richness at the dawn, and that is the first to separate the fasting), while the day of the tenth of the tenth of (Bashnas) is from the day of the The Romans or the Persians uh.And the twenty people from the month of Nissan (Abrail), which is thirty one day, the day of the day of the month of the month (Iyar - May).The ritual.It is six months.And the Sunnah of investigations is four chapters: the fasting: three months, which is called by the people of Iraq and the randa of the rabbi, and the loyalty is three, and it is the same Al -Kharif is three months, and the winter is three months.This verse is valid for the two communications.And the territories of the scholars of the meeqaat, dividing the Sunnah into a sacrifice, a summer, a burgundy, and a winter, and the principle of the Sunnah of the Lord is the entry of the sun in the bark of the lamb.These two Rahi are a merchant and a mirror that was a Quraysh that you prepare in these two chapters of the Sunnah, and they are in the winter to the country of al -Habbah.Humir, and the other in the fasting to the

competence, so if he did not find the family of the family The house of his family to a well -known position, and he struck them with a hobby and remained in it until they died hunger The obedience was made up and a fulfillment.Because one of their children was a rack of Assad bin Hashem, Hashem's shrine was a fiancé in Quraysh and said: You have spoken to you, you will say that you will say in it, and you will be in it, And you are the people of the forbidden of God and the people for you to follow and almost this excuse comes to you, and then all the sons of the father gathered on two passengers for the tranquility, so what is the righteous of the righteousness The jurist is one of his clans until their poor became like their richness, and in which the Matroud of Al -Khuza’i says: O man, the man who turns his journey ∗∗∗: ؎ The pledge is one of its horizons ∗∗∗ and the rest of the jahlal ؎ and the people who are rich in their poor ∗∗∗ until their poor becomes like (P-559) and

Levant, the king of the dungeon, and the king of the king, So Hashem took this from the king of the Levant, which is the king of the Romans, and he took a sun of my hearts, and the required from the king of the right, and he took a nose of the king They make the heads of the doves and the grapes of the ravages also calls the elafs, they give them something of the profit and carry them to them, and they will be blessed with them.To stop them The hundreds of travel while they are enough for a Quraysh to pay the elders, so they gathered for them with the security of all of the way to the right and to the Levant, and they were called the mourners.The discussion was delusional from this that each of the four of these is a nomad, so he claimed that the nomad was four, Ibn Attiyah said: This is a saying.Ibn Attiyah was charity, because the one of the people of the era, which was four, did not need to be four.Perhaps these brotherhood were the travelers with the jugs on the bond; Because they

from the Arab With what is easy for them to build the kaaba and the legacy of the pilgrimage, and that the mosque mosque made them the forbidden and made them rushed and forbidden in the souls of all the Arabs in the most important.And when the doves that deprive the most deprived and dignities that are not forbidden, like a slower, the rulings, and a fox, so the travelers are made for them in the country, from the country of the country, from the country of the country, And (P-560) has the people of the needs, they travel with them, and the people of trading, they carry them their good He asked her in the rest of the country, so the people of Mecca took advantage of the merchants, as they did not be the people of agriculture or a burning, as they were with a powerful and unbearable, and they were gone In the country, the love of righteousness, righteousness, atom, customer, valleys, clothes, and the Sioff al -Yammaniya, and from the Levant, the love, the dates, the Zayt, the Zabib, the clothes, the clothes, the clothes, the clothes, the Zabib, the clothes, the Zabib, the clothes, the Zabib, the clothes, the Zabib, the clothes, the Zabib, the clothes, the Zabib, the clothes, the Zabib, and the clothes, An increase in what was made for them with the greatest of the Arabs from the most sacred, and what was established for them from the obsessive of Hajj and its

his saying: Let them worship the Lord of this house on all the faces.And the worship in which the worship of God alone is without the partnership of the partnership with him in worship; Because the trace of those who do not deserve worship with God, who is the truth about it, is not worshipers or because they were occupied by the worship of idols from the worship of God, no They remember God except in the days of Hajj in the metaphor that they have increased some of them after their saying: I have no partner for you except for you, it is for you.And the knowledge of (Lord) in addition to this house without it is said: Let them worship God, so that he will be given to Him (Lord) from the investigators of the servants.And the addition of (Lord) was made to this house without being said:
