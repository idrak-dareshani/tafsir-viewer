The Quranic researcher is forced to you, the night of fasting to your women, there is a dress for you, and you are a dress for them, God knows that you were you, and you will be blessed with you, and you will be forgiven for you And seek what God has written for you has moved on the rulings of fasting to the two countries in some of the aspects of Ramadan.The precedent.And they mentioned the reason for the descent of this verse as an obligatory word that is not clear.After that, he did not eat, and his family did not preach after that.(P-181) Bin Aazib that Qais Bin Sarmah came to his house after the stranger, he wants his food, and his wife said to him: until we are a good So I found him as sleeping, and she said: He was disappointed for you, so he remained like that, and when the day was described, I was clouded by hunger, and in the book of interpretation from the authority of the sah Appointed, he said: When the fast of Ramadan came down, they did not approach all Ramadan, and there were men who betrayed themselves, so God Almighty revealed that God knows that you are God.The verse, and it was signed for Kaab ibn Malik, like what happened to Omar, and this verse was revealed by these events, so he said: It was the leaving of the most from After the prayer of dinner, it is a ruling on the Sunnah and then copied, and this is the saying of the vocabulary of the interpreters, and that the father of the Muslim Al -Asfahi denied this to this He was decided on our part and said: It is a copy of what was in the law of the Christians.The fasting is only established in the day without the night, so I do not think that the verse is a creation of pornography, but it is a news about the pornography that is determined in the origin of the origin of the fast, And what is meant by the heroic of something that some of the Muslims are delusional, which is that the most between the night does not go to two times; The breakfast time, and the suhoor stayed, and they made the time for breakfast what was between the strange to dinner; Because they were sleeping and the prayer of dinner and its resurrection, then if they prayed the dinner, they did not eat except the eating of the suhoor and that they were in the matter The sleep is the principle of the night of the night, think that the sleep if he gets the usual time, it will also be what is forbidden from the greatest and the intercourse to the time of the suhoor The largest is without consensus; As they were sinning from the phases in Ramadan on a side, and he came in a Muslim authenticity that Abu Hurairah was seen that means after the death of the Messenger of God.To them from the people of the book as it requires it What was narrated by Muhammad ibn Jarir from the way of the Saddi, and perhaps they are the time that they did not ask him for the Messenger of God ﷺ, and perhaps that is not the same The fasting of Ramadan was made, and these dispersed tunnels occurred.He was sacred before he did not feed anything from the night, so God sent down, and now they will be blessed, so they eat after that, so he said: We descended on this rule (P-182) to increase the Bayan; As God has taught him some of the Muslims on themselves, and he revealed it to his Messenger ﷺ.This indicates that the Muslims did not spread that and did not tell the Messenger of God, and for that we do not find in the narratives of Bukhari and the women that the people are mentioned in that The hadith of Qais Bin Sarmah at Abu Dawood, and perhaps from Al -Rawi’s visit.As for that, it was done and then copied, so I will not count it; As it is not from the religion of religion, who was first -fast for the day in the Sunnah, then he was brought up, and he made fasting a month of elimination between him and between him The Muslims are to be exposed after that night and day, so he does not forgive only a few hours of night.And the night of fasting: the night that is followed by the fasting of the day, which is running on the use of the Arabs in the addition of the night to the one who is loyal to it, but it is not for it.The night after a day.And the spoiler in the basis and the tongue: that its truth is the words with the women in the affairs of the time, then they are released on the gathering of a group, and it was said that it is a truth, and it is a truth in it, and it is a truth.By (to) to protect the intended meaning, which is the hypothesis, and say: It is a dress for you a ritual sentence, as is the cause of what is before it, that is: it is permissible for you.That is, if the fast was imposed on people in the night, which is the time to be broken, the imams were from the proximity of women in that time, and the hardships are not in a way Constipation from their proximity in the day; For the day to be used to the day, then the Almighty said: It is a dress for you to be a sense of the severity of the intensity The Qur’an, because the Arabs were expressed in their saying: the thing is the thing, if it is connected to it, but they will be pleased with it in the thieves of the adultery The Qur’an, and he revived it and made it a new origin after that it was a forgotten man And (Takhtanon) Al -Raghbat said: The sedimentation, the horse of the horseman The wow ranked one thousand to move it and open what was before it, and the seduction of the same is a representative to deposit it, as it was not assigned to it as if it was deceived by it; As it is illusory that the hardship is a holy place for it, and it is not a rumor, and it is a representative of its mistakes in the launch of the act of what you see it (P-183) And they are used as the one who is trying to betray, and it will be like the representative in the saying of the Almighty: “They deceive God [Al-Baqarah: 9]”.The meaning here is that you resort to her betrayal or their attribution to it, and it was said: The seduction is more severe than the treachery, such as acquisition and gain as in the scouts, I said: I said: and I said: About those who betray themselves [Women: 107].And the words of the Almighty: Now, they will make it clear to the pornography, and the meaning of his saying: (Now) referring to the legitimacy of the missionaries at that time, but then it is clear: then it is clear.You are your souls, and the request for goodness, and what God has written: What is permitted by the preachers of women in the time of the time of fasting or asking what God has destroyed for you from the father The women may be formed from that, and that is to multiply the nation and the return of the species in the land.* * * Eat and drink until the righteous steps of you are found to you, then the fasting is the fast of the fools, then they complete the fast to the night, and do not preach it, and you are in the way.(Prayers), and the wall is the heart of the kint or the wool or otherwise, it is agreed upon between the clothes with the stretching of the needy or the sewn, it is said that the trick is said.And in the news of the graves of the children of the illiterate that they found the Muwadiyah, may God be pleased with him in his grave like a stem, and the steps here are intended by the rumors that are in the dark and the darkening of the righteous.The ignorance of the ignorant: ؎ When I lit a burial and a light from the morning, a ritual ritual and his saying: (From the dawn) “from the chain of transmission, that is: the ray of the one who is from the one.It was said: symmetry.Likewise, the saying of Abi Daad: From the morning; Because the steps are great in the cake that he sewn, it is a verse of the two meanings of the partner, and made it in the scouts, similar to it, so let him not, so let him not He launched this meaning other than some words, such as the verse and the house of my father, Daad The suspicion; Because it is not clear.(P-184) He came in the end, and by showing the significance that the constipation will be when the dawn is clear to the view, which is the sincere dawn, then the saying It is clear) the definition of the time of the breakfast, with the sweetest of the human being, and he has learned from it, there is no condition that it is the time of the time of fasting, as it is not in the time of the time One of them The principle of the other, so it was his saying: Do fast fasting to the night with the time of the time of fasting, and for that he said: (Then you will complete) and he did not say: (Then they are fasting) before.And (to the night) is a choice for it (to) to the significance of the miracle of the fungus when the sunsets are so that "it" is extended with it with the end of the other, so that the one is not, so that it is the same The night.Know that “then” in the compassion of the sentence of the arrogant cries, and he is a certainty with the time of breakfast; Because that is like the evil for them, and there is no deeds to what the Abu Jaafar al -Khabaz al -Samarqandi went from the subordination of Hanafi from the recipient of the one who is in the authority of the ritual The intention is about the dawn, as a result of the downtown of my father, from the last of the intention of the intention to the old laugh.Building on the fact that “then” for the cries, and that the completion of fasting is required to express it, so he said: Then after the two who are left of the dawn, they will be shown to the fast Fast after the time of the dawn, and it is on the cost and destiny in it to the significance of the light signal - a disappearance of the meaning of the crime in the kindness of the “then” This is a story in the understanding of some of the companions for this verse and in its descent separated, so al -Bukhari and Muslim narrated “on the authority of Uday ibn Hatim, who said: You show you the white plan from the smooth man.The father is from the bonds, so I looked at the Messenger of God, so I mentioned to him that, and the Messenger of God said that your corruption is a disease.And the whiteness of the day." It was narrated on the authority of Sahl ibn Sa`d, who said: I came down and eat and drink until the righteous steps are shown to you from the stereotype and did not come from the fence, then the feet of the fool, then the feet of the feet, then the feet of the feet, then it is the good.One of them is in his man, the righteous, and the steadfast steps, and he did not eat until his vision is seen for him, so God will come down after the abundance He is happy that the same as what Adi Bin Hatim had done, and his work was otherwise before him with a long period of time The imposition of (P-185) two years is two years, and it is not reasonable for the Muslims to remain seven or eight years in the same way as this mistake, so it is the end of the hadith of the hadeeth.It is in it in the first period of the law of fasting, and the carrying of the hadith of Uday ibn Hatim is that an enemy fell in the same mistake as the mistake in which it is in which it is the one who has come to me On the authority of Abd Allah ibn Idris, on the authority of Husayn, on the authority of Al -Sha’abi, on the authority of my enemy that he said: When I came down until the righteous steps are shown to you The bond from the dawn, etc., then it has mentioned the verse is completed, so it is necessary for the carrier to be the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa`d on the authority of the one who has done it.The supplies before the custody of Ramadan; That is, the fasting of Ashura or the fast of the vow and in the fast of the voluntary, so when the verse of the imposition of Ramadan and in it from the dawn, they knew that they did not do it.That is for me, Bin Hatim.And the hadith is easy, there is no suspicion in the validity of his bond, except that it is entitled to be his saying in it: and he did not descend from the dawn and say it: So, then God is the same It is narrated in the sense, so he narrated it in the words of anxious anxiety, which is not clear; Because he did not fall into the two valids except from the narration of Said ibn Abi Maryam, on the authority of Abu Gasan, on the authority of Abu Hazim, on the authority of Sahl ibn Sa`d, and he said: (From the dawn) and it was clear that he said, so God will come down after and eat and drink to his saying: (from the dawn).In any way, it was not in this thing of the delay of the Bayan; Because the meaning of the steps in the verse is an apparent to the Arabs, the expressions of it from the pretext of the appearance, not from the camel, and the understanding of some of them is the intent of it.For those who have been afflicted with the meaning of the righteous steps and the steadfast steps, so they understood the most famous of my steps and they thought that his saying: (from the dawn) is attached (From) Al -Talali; That is, it will be shown by the light of the dawn, so make what they made and for that the Prophet said ﷺ to my enemy ibn Hatim, “If you are a matter The lack of mold, and it is a manner directed from the sins of his word, peace be upon him.And the Almighty said: Do not preach them, and you are a kindness on his saying: The mosque is the verse, and they differed in the attribute of the mosque, so it was necessary to be from the collected mosque, and it was said by the mosque, which is the verification and it is the right of it, and it is the truth Hanifah and Al -Shafi’i, may God have mercy on them, and his rulers in the books of jurisprudence, and not from the extent of this interpretation.* * * That is the limits of God, so do not bring them closer, as well as God shows his verses to people, perhaps they may fear a warning of warning of the violation of the rulings of the rulings.Referring to what was presented, and the news about it with the limits is that the referral to it is the neutralism that is intended for the precedent words, and it is in his saying: until it is the one who says: The night, and you are afraid of everything in which there is a definition that is subject to a disobedience, so it is not wrong to go to the entry of the rulings of pornography in the indication of the same: They preached.The limits, the angels, and the ends of the things that the woman entered it, entered into something other, and likened to The rulings of the limits because their rivals are removed from a solution to prevention, and in the hadith, “I limit a limit, so do not accommodate it” and the increase of the two of it will come to him in the saying of God: Taken it [Al -Baqarah: 229].And his saying: Do not approach it, it is forbidden for its approaches signed in al -Kharj from it on the way of the kinna; Because near the limit, the intention of the elderly is required, as the Almighty said: Do not approach the money of the yatim, unless it is the most good [Al -Anam: 152], and this is what he said: God does not assume it [Al -Baqarah: 229] as this will come to you, and in the sense of the verse the hadith of “Whoever protects around the meal is about to fall into it.” And the saying in: Also, God shows his verses to people who presents his counterpart in his saying: Likewise, we made you a nation and a simplicity [Al -Baqarah: 143], meaning: as it is clear For people, that is: all his verses of all people, and the intention that this is the matter of God in clarifying his rulings, so that nothing of them is attentive to the people, and he said: A will to meet them in violation, because if he did not show them the rulings, they would not be guided by the way of compliance, or perhaps they will be satisfied With the commandments on the face of it, then the gravitational piety is for them, if God did not show them to them, I would have come to the worship of you, and they are not, and they are not.Surprisingly, when the Bayyan is not taken by the default (P-187), except that they do not reach the thief of piety; That is, as the perfection of the intention of God Almighty, perhaps they fear this, a house that is not an act of an action, as well as: On the first direction, the verbal deleted for the village.
