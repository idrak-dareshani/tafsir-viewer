bound (Askin) It is used in the gratitude of the ownership and abandonment, and there is no matter to him that he seeks himself to silence paradise, as there is no ability for him.And Zaid (you) is located for the sake of compassion (your husband) on the guarantor of the one who is in the (Sakin), which is the usual of the Arabic when the name of the name is on the authority of the name of the name They can hardly leave it, they mean the increase in the clarification of the kind, so it will be the same From it in the words, the chapter is not the same as this guarantee, restricting, confirming the proportions because the two of the guarantee is necessary, not good for the one who speaks to it The Samaid defines that the speaker is affordable, but it is not devoid of obtaining the report of the meaning of the host, which is what he referred to in the revelation, For the one who is reluctant to be corrected by kindness to him.And the husband is every second thing with something other between them, comparing, in some way.It appears that it is a rigid name because all his visions in the words are noticed in the meaning of its second, two or two other things.Each one of two associates in a state is called a husband to the other, he said: “Or he married them with remembrance and females [Al -Shura: 50]), meaning that he makes for anyone It is not one of its categories, and a close proximity of this recovery is a lifetime.The female was called the village for the man with a marriage because it was associated with it and made it secondly, and the man is called a husband for it, so there is no way for it, so there is no way for it, so there is no way for it, so there is no way A splendor of a splendor that is a name that is a name and not with description.And they have made al-Farzdaq in his saying: (P-429) ؎ And he who sought to spoil my husband as a sideline to the country's lion, and he forgives the jurisprudence of the jurisprudence Return to the husband if they want the man of the man to intend the denial of the confusion in the report of the rulings in their books in the same saying, the saying of the one, the saying: The saying is the saying of the wife, and it is a good manner.And in the authenticity of a Muslim Anas ibn Malik, “The Prophet ﷺ used to speak one of his women, and a man passed by him, and he called him, so -and -so, so he came to him, so he said to him, this is the way of the hadeeth.With the meeting, it is appointed as the phrase of the hadith in the bond to Anas, and it is not the dormant of the Prophet ﷺ.In this verse, he folded the creation of the husband of Adam, and he was mentioned in other verses, such as his saying, the Almighty who created you from one soul and created from it.The women and the wall of the nams.And the name of the husband of Adam did not want the Qur’an and its name at the Arab The Messenger of God is informed of him ﷺ that he said: “People are for Adam and the Hawiyah of a serving of a radiation that they will not fill.” The hadith.The “slander” by opening the Tao and broken it, the one who is close to its fullness, that is, they do not want the talisman, for each of the talismans of the human being is subject to the leadership.And Khalid Bin Khaddash Basri and trusted by Ibn Ma’in, Abu Hatim and Silmann Ibn Harb, and Ibn al -Muddi was weakened.The name of the husband of Adam with the Arabs is a passion and its name in the transit is obligatory in it.It was taken.And in the third chapter, Adam called the name of his wife a passion because she is the mother of every neighborhood.Ibn Sa`d said, Adam slept, and the passion was created from his ribs, so he woke up and found it with him, and he said: “Atha” that is, a woman with the naps, that is, the name of it, that is, the name of it, that is, the name of it, that is, the name Adam.He was presented with his saying, and he taught Adam the names [Al -Baqarah: 31] that Adam called for himself, so, so perhaps a distant from Isa.And its name is with the transit, the fullness of the glorious brotherhood and a splendor after the thousand, and it is also said that they live with an important and a thousand and a thousand in the last of the Arabs.Iba.And in the Ayb.And in the teeth that the passion was created in paradise after I dwell in Adam in Paradise and that God created it to insult him, he said: He said: He is forgotten.And the matter of (rested) is a matter of giving; That is, God made Adam and his wife in paradise.(P-430) The knife takes the place to be the majority of the human being.Heaven is a piece of the earth in which the darkest trees and the waters are well -established for the human being, if the sunflower is scared, and it is eaten from its fruit if it is hungry and the water is from the water from the water.The tree and its appearance is the look of all of that.Paradise collects what the human being is aspiring from the same.The curiosity of paradise is to define the era, and it is a heaven with a dedication to Adam, which he sees if the curiosity in paradise is a story for what he is exhausted in what he is in it.If we are the story of the saying of God, we have the meaning, and that is permissible in the story of the saying.And it has The scholars of Islam differed in the awareness of this paradise, as the predecessor of the predecessor went to the predecessor that it is the paradise of the immortality that is the one who is the believers and the believers and the faithful and the faithful The existence of the global world, that is, in the sky, and that it is prepared by God for the people of good after the resurrection, and this is imitated by the people of the Sunnah of the Sunnah He is the one who is witnessed by the narrators of the verses and the narrators about the Prophet ﷺ.And do not count that it is a lot of darkness, but it benefits the dominance of the suspicion, and this case has an effect in the bond.And the father of the Muslim Al -Asfahi, Muhammad ibn Bahar and Abu al -Qasim al -Balkhi and al -Mutharabi, is the only one of the Jubayi until it is a paradise in the land that God created for the sake of God.Al -Baydawi quoted them that it is two in the middle or is between Faris and Krman, and I think that this is arising from their demands that they be aware of what is the one who is mentioned in the place Aden.In the second chapter in the second chapter of formation: The Lord God took Adam and put it in the paradise of an adult to do it and keep it then.She said: So the Lord God brought him out of the paradise of an adult to do the land that was taken from it, and this requires that the paradise of an adult is not in the land, but it is for the sake Paradise is a rally in the land, and it is an apparent and described the river of this paradise, which he will be watered by a river that comes out of an adult, so he will be watered from the paradise and from there, and there is no The name of the one is Qishun, which is the surrounding of all the land of the container, and they are from the children of Kosh, as in the correctness of the formation, and the name of the second river is a joke, which is the surrounding.And the name of the third river “limit to say”, which is the neighbor, the east of a diligence.And the river is the fourth of the vertigo.And I did not stand on the firmness of this.And I saw in the book of Abd al-Haqq al-Sabi, which was (P-431) Jewish and Islam and wrote a book in the response to the Jews, the unmountable bodies in the response to the response to the response to the response to the response.With the sake of the signs of the richness of the glorified and broken the significant sign, and the point is on the letter of the eye, a sacrifice of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same With a dimension, or two sides, or between Faris and Krman, who resorted to that is that the paradise of the reward is a house as a money that is not appropriate for it to obtain the disobedience, and that it is not a house.Returning without a refuge, because that is one of the conditions of paradise, not to influence the place, and all of it made God Almighty when he wanted him.And the people of the Sunnah begged by the fact that the “Al” in the paradise of the external covenant, and not the same, but it is appointed to the external covenant of the external covenant of the good The three, as there is no meaning for the bearing that it is the mother of the truth, because it has been involved in it The action of the rak'ah, and there is no meaning to attach it to the truth with the dispute of the like: the man is better than the woman, and there is no meaning for the bearing on the covenant from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one It is appointed that the matter is in the place of reward and dignity, so it must be related to a well -known heaven, and there is no meaning for the bearing on the exemption for that.And when the intended is the penalty, it is to be attached to a specific matter with a martyrdom, and there are no witnesses except the paradise known, especially the terminology.It may be said that the pain is for the covenant and for the grace of Adam is a paradise in the land with a certainty that I refer to it by defining the covenant, and for that, I am the one who said that I am the one who said: Paradise, when the intended from the stories, we have told the entertaining reds of our dedication to the language that the language that is attached to it is a blood or from the one who is the same So the perception of paradise will be a perspective in it to our identifier, so Adam may have known what is meant by his house with another way, other than the one who is so and not to be.With the exclusive way because the preservation of the abandoned paradise in our words is the words of the definition, indicating the eyes of the other way that the other way is the one who has known it.That is, we say to him, I will give the seat that you call you today with paradise, and it is the one that the appearance is that the paradise that I have dwells is Adam is the garden of the house.And the meaning of the greatest of paradise is from its fruit; Because paradise is obligated by fruits, which is what is meant by eating, and for that it is made (from) a whiteness by downloading some of what the place contains.It is permissible to be (from) the indication indicating that the most harmful in it is the eating of what this paradise rises like this.(P-432) Al-Rajad and a description of the Sufis on which the context is eaten, and the righteous, and the good will in which there is no habit in which there is no one in which it is not, and the saying of any of any The positions of the most of them wanted, and when their wills are not confined to the positions of the expansion of the general public in the ear with the way of the obligatory, and in the greatness of the greatest He married him when she was constructed, alerting him that God made the rituals a jelly for a person whose life does not last except with him.And his saying and do not bring this tree, so you will be among the oppressors, meaning it and do not eat from the tree because it is its proximity, but it is the intention of the one who is from it The most forbidden from the abundance of the one is that the proximity is from the thing that creates a call and a long time to it in the hadith, “Whoever protects around the rest of the meal is about to fall into it.” In the manner of the view, he says: If it is said, do not approach - with the opening of the Arabs - it was with it, not to be dressed in the verb, and if it was said - with the guarantee of the Arabs - It was not convicted of it.It is strange, for if it is close and near the ritual of the generosity and heard in the sense of our own, then you have broken the Arabs or opened it in the harms, so what is forbidden is that it is forbidden for the one who is forbidden Mazzi, which is the dressing, and some of it is my right, and it is not for the reward for a special weight in the verbs, otherwise it is not a matter In some ways, then that adultery is a verse for the perception, and that is good, and it is one of the merits of the rituals It specializes after breaking the eyes with the complete severity, and after the eyes of the eye by bending from the place, and for that, the supplication is given to the sake of the sake Farm, Fatima said that the daughter of Al -Khuza’i is: ؎ My brothers, do not go away ever ∗∗∗ And God, and God has come after and in the timing of the end of the majesty of the The arms, and it is the origin of the origins of the money of the Malik, may God have mercy on him, and in which a separation is determined in the origins of jurisprudence.And the indication of (this) to a visual tree for Adam and his husband, and the meant is a tree of its type or if it was a tree and only in paradise.The people of the stories have been disagreed with the help of this trees, so he was on Ali and Ibn Masoud and Said bin Jabir and Al -Saddi, that it is the honor, The interpreters that it is the bow, and on the authority of Qutaidah and Ibn Jarraj, and Ibn Jarraj attributed it to a group of companions that it is the tree of the fig.He fell in the travel of the formation of its dignity, and it was expressed by a tree of the knowledge of good and evil.(P-433) And his saying, so you will be among the unjust, that is, from the aggressors and the most famous of the injustice of the injustice in the expansion of the Arab It is forbidden for the reward for the blessing, or an expulsion of the soul and the guidance, if it is the one who is forbidden from the most from the tree with the meeting of the virtue of the rituals of the rituals of The injustice of themselves by the adaptation of God's anger and punishment, and on the second, the injustice is for themselves to be forbidden from the perception of dignity.
