The Qur’anic researcher does not eat your money among you with falsehood and show it to the rulers so that you can eat a group of people of people with ourselves, and you know the kindness His saying: That is the limits of God, so do not bring it closer [Al -Baqarah: 187] Another forbidden eating, which is the whole money in falsehood, and the problems that have increased the appropriateness, this is from the sentence of the hidden rulings for the sake of what is made from the most disturbed.Therefore, he was compassionate to his curves, and it is with that the origin of a great legitimacy for money in Islam.The eaters of money in falsehood was a well -known for the people of the ignorant, but the most financial of their financial affairs were, because their acquisition was from the temptation, and from the one who is the one who is a good And from the eaters of the first millions of orphans, and from the rituals and the domination, and from the dusty and the part of that.And all of that is the falsehood that is not a kind of soul, and the eating is its right to enter the food to the stomach from the mouth, and it is here to take the intent of the intended.Because that taking is the most like all of its flaws, and for that, it is not called the money of others the name of the largest, and it is not released on the loan and the privilege of the name Little; As there is no occasion between the form of taking money other than it for itself by intending to return it and the elderly body as it is not hidden.The money: the collection of money, and we know it that it is the amount of it, the destiny of the establishment of the pension of the individuals of the people in the ethics of the warnings, needs, and good deeds in the interests Has to make.So the air is not money, nor the water of the rain, the hands, and the seas, the money, nor the soil, money, nor the milestones and the shadows of trees are money, and the water is dedicated to the wells of money, and the dirt of the vehicles is money Money, and what is made by the woman for itself in a mountain.(P-188) The money is three types: the first type is what the residence is established in itself without standing on anything, which is the food like the love, the domain, and the time of the time With his wool, poetry, sonship, and rituals, he said: And he made you from the Galdod of Anam, with a homosexuality that you will be hidden on the day of you, and the day of you Furniture and enjoyment until [Al -Nahl: 80], and he said: Let them ride from them and who you eat [Ghafir: 79] And the Arabs were named after money.The one who carries it in the way of God is what I have protected from them in their country, and this type is the highest and fixed kinds of money; Because the one who has the right to it is unable The time of peace and the time of war, and at the time of trust and the time of fear, and when the people are satisfied with him and his numbers, and when the people are confused and his numbers, and in the hadith, the mother of my money is that You ate, and you were given, and you sing, "The confinement is here for the dawn in the advertisement from where the material benefits and the bright benefit.The second type: What is the residence of it and what it completes from what is stopped by it, such as the land for the cultivation and the children, and the slander, and the slander, and the fire, and the fire, and the fire, For the watering of trees, and industries machines to make things from the wiping and wool and the part of that, and this type is without the second type to stop it on the things She sought it with it, and perhaps it was without the pods of a war, fear, or a way of ways.The third type: the residence is not made by its muddles from what the human beings were broken on, making it compensation because it is wanted by the things, and this is the one who is the one In the process, and the most terrified of human beings in this type is on the enemies of gold and silver, and what was broken on it is some of the peasles from the handling of the goodness and the goodness, and the rituals, the rituals, the goodness, the ritual, the goodness, the goodness, the rituals, and the ritual of the good The delayed from dealing with the white neutrality and the financial rituals; It is the feet of the known financial expense, and it is the argument of commitment from the disposal to pay the amount of what is with the righteousness of it, and this is not the same That is the approach of the individuals, and the rituals that the governments are promoted with financial amounts that are treated by those of those government.And he said in Al-Taraif: I have a praise, and I wanted it to be that it was a pursuit in which it has a cost (P-189), and for that, I crossed it, and that is for you, and for you to the money It is involved in it that it is infected and the acquisition has three methods: the first way: the way of the enemy from the earth said: He is the one who created for you: He is the one who made the earth to you, so they walked in its hearts, and they were all of his livelihood [King: 15], and this is like a wood, the hashish, and the wildfissitis, the sacrifice, and the fruit of the trees of the It is without a crowd, and it may be a mockery, so that it will be acquired by the past.The second way: the Etisago, and that is in the birth, the cultivation, the carnivore and the milk, and the industrialization, such as the creatures of the new, the tall, the dress and the weapon.The third way: the entry of the hand of others, as there is no need for him, either by dealing with the one that the woman is given what has increased in his need from what he needs to be from him His need from what he needs, or by giving what people have made a knowledge that his property is very serious that he is taken with him what was destined for the sake of his destiny in the authority With them, or either With force and dominance, such as fighting on lands and water.And the falsehood is an effective name from the hero if it goes away from loss and loss, i.E.: the body of the face, and there is no doubt that the face is what satisfies the owner of the money.And the guarantee is like: Do not eat your money to the last of the verse in general for all Muslims, and do (and do not eat) and fall into the perception of the forbidden, so it is a year For all Muslims for every eaters, and in all money, for here we are all the entire collection of eaters and the collection of the money eaten, and if you meet the whole of the words The intercourse of every individual of the group with every individual of the other gathering on the distribution is the rituals of the people of the people, and their saying: We yourself [Prohibition: 6] and carry that it is like that, but in the sense that every individual is met with an individual, other than the individual of itself, and it is not the same.[Al -Hujurat: 11], and his saying: If you enter a homes, then surrender to yourself [Al -Nur: 61], and bearing that it will be from the meetings of every individual with all the individuals, and the people of the people: Siqat [Ghafir: 9] and reflection on that on the readers.It was known that these two gatherings are here from the second type; That is, some of them eat other money (P-190) with falsehood; With his saying: between you; Because “between” it requires a mediator through two parties, so he knew that the two parties are eaten and eaten from it and the money between them, so it is necessary for the eaten to be the eaten, and it was not the eaten.It is useful for his saying: (between you).The meaning of its eating is false, eating it with the face of the face, and this is the one who is the one: the first arrangement: what all the Samaid knew about what is erased in its costume, and the sake of the sins.The second arrangement: What the legitimate right has been right, and he indicated that it was false, and it was hidden from them and this is the same as usury; They said: The sale is like usury [Al -Baqarah: 275] and the same as the bribing of the rulers, and the same is the sake of the fruit before the bodies of its goodness; In the hadith: “I saw that God forbids the fruit with what takes your brother’s money.The third ritual: What the scholars have given up from that, so what is achieved in it and the description of the false Expanding and hugging, like Ibn Al -Qasim, and he looked at the money, and detailed it in jurisprudence.It was said: This verse was descended in the case of the servants of Al -Hadrami and the lighter of Qais Al -Kandi, who seized the Messenger of God ﷺ in the land, so this is the same.A remembrance in a Muslim correctness, and it was not mentioned in it that this verse was descended in them, but that Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned.And the Almighty said: And they will be denoted to it The judgment is a compassion for “eat”; That is, do not show it to the rulers, so that you can be cured to eat all the money in falsehood.This image was dedicated to the prohibition after the remembrance of what it includes, and it is the eating of the money with falsehood; Because this is the strictness of the gathering of many prohibitions, and the significance is that the bribes are given a sinner with the fact that he did not eat money, but rather eaten, but he eats it, but he eats it, but it is not.The waw will be for the sake, and “they are spoken” is based on the fact that it is after it in the final answer, so the forbidden will be from the group of the two things; That is, do not eat it between you, which are indicated by it to the rulers to eat, and it is the result that the one who is forbidden in this verse is a special bribe, so that it is the one who is the one who will be The type is one of the money in falsehood.And the inherent in the origin is to send the evidence in the well, and it is here that is metaphor in the smoothness and payment.(P-191) The meaning is on the first involvement: Do not pay your money to the ruling so that you can eat with it as a group of people of people with sin; Performing with it is to pay it to create the rulers to spend the defenders with the fullness of others, it is a prohibition of the bribery, and the judiciary without the right, and for the sake of the right By eliminating falsehood.The meaning of the second indifference: Do not eat your money with falsehood in the event of the abstracts of money with money, but the rulers are to be cured by the judgment of the rulers, to the righteous You can be dominated by dominance, and as if he called them to the costume of this involvement is the observance of the story that was mentioned in the cause The interpretation of the verse; Because if it had been correct, it would have been carried by the verse on the prohibition of bribery for the sake of eating the money, indicating the prohibition of eating money with a bribe.And on what we have seen, the verse indicated the prohibition of eating money with falsehood, and on the prohibition of the ruling to eat the money in falsehood, and on the authority of the judge, the judge does not make it not.And on the prohibition of wickedness in judgment with falsehood, even if the brightness; Because the prohibition of bribery was to be prohibited, but it was for the change of the truth, and it is not a crime that the gathering of things is one of the most important things that the Islam is confronted to establish it, and it is not in the way that they were not in the ignorance of it.They were the money of those who did not seek to prevent their mothers from the greatest, so they were eating the weakening money, he said: The Sunnah of the people: I drank it ∗∗∗ except with the permission of another one, but it is the same They spark the bribes of the ruling, and from the opponents of Amir ibn al -Tafil and the relationship of the son of the three to Harm ibn Qutbah al -Fazari, each one of them is made of one of them.He has the precedence over the other He spends one of them, but he spent between them that they have rumored the camel, and they are equal in the ritual of the land, so he said: Between you ∗∗∗ a flower like a brilliant moon, it does not accept the bribery in its ruling ∗∗∗ and does not come to the losers of the loser and it is said that the first of those who walk from the ruling of the ignorance is Al-Nahashli with a vessel of the camels driven by Abd al-Bin Anf al-Kalb in a contradiction between him and between the worshipers of Bin Fadla Al-Faksi, so that it is the same (P-192) The first person to walk in Islam is the boy of Omar ibn al -Khattab, Rashah al -Mughira ibn Shu`bah, to present it in the ear in the entry of Omar; Because he was embarrassed when he was the middle of the ears for people and the right to adhere to the ears for the previous one, as it was not obligatory to be the same to the etiquette was Apparently on the right of the precedent, and it was a wilderness, and the money was for the sake of having to be brought up, and I do not calculate this only from the lies of the people of whims for the hatred of the one who is not.Its deeds: the deceased was not seen in that; Because the harmful harm is not changed to it, or perhaps he saw it as charity and did not intend to be able He was not guided by this wisdom.The bribery was forbidden by God, the Almighty, the text of his verse; Because if it is for the judiciary with the neighbor, it is for the eating of money in falsehood, and it is not the same money in falsehood, so this is a kind of the first time; Because the ruler is the client of money, it is not eaten, and if it is for the sake of the truth, it is the same money in falsehood; Because the judiciary of the right is obligatory, and the same is all money that the ruler takes on the judiciary from the specials unless it does not make anything from the house Something appointed to the judiciary, whether in it both of the two characteristics.The significance of this verse is that the judge’s judge does not affect the change of the prohibition of eating money from his saying: and they are denied by the rule So the money that one eats is made by the ruling is sinful, and it is clear that the judiciary is not permissible and is implemented only by an apparent, and this is what is not like in it, in which there is no suspicion, in which there is no way in which there is no For Abu Hanifa, the jurisprudence of the jurisprudence, and he said that the judge’s judgment is permissible and implemented in the interior of the interior and a backwardness if it is a solution or a forbidden person, and he claimed it with the rule of the rule.That is, the judiciary was a contract or a dirt and was a testimony of the testimony of witnesses, and the judge was what is correct to start, this is the one who told him about his virginity, And some of them specialize in marriage, and he embarrassed that with what was narrated that a man spent a woman who is without her, so she refused to answer him, so he claimed that he had to go to me and he was obligated to him.Two witnesses, and he spent their testimony, so the woman said when he spent it: If it is not, then he will be removed from it, so he said to you: Sahim, his chain of transmission is not more than his companions, and he does not oppose the legal conditions, nor the narrated hadiths.(P-193) He does not take it, but it is seized for him a piece of fire.The weakness in the judgment and the advertisement by denying the rule of it, and perhaps if it is required of the contract from it, it is forbidden, and the judgment is related to it.And it is clear that the intention of Abu Hanifa is that the judiciary is in the right and corrupt, and it is not permissible from everything in which the servant's right is not in it - that the judge’s judge is in his health, and he will be done.His conditions are expanded on people, so this weakness is not hidden, and that is not followed by one of his companions.And his saying: (And you know) is confirmed; Because the signs of the money for the ruling to eat the money of the people is a scholar who is not referred to its manufacture With this Kayifi, it is one of those who ate the money of people from knowledge and baptism, so its generosity is more severe.
