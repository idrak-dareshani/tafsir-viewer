The Quranic researcher, we sent a messenger to you, as we sent us to Pharaoh, a messenger.After the speech was directed to the Prophet ﷺ.And the appropriateness for that gossip to their Eid after his command to patience with what they say and their migration is a beautiful migration, when he said to him, the offspring of me, and the lies of the lying: (And a painful torment [Al -Muzzammil: 13]).Speech is a premature contradiction, and this discourse is not considered tattooing; Because the words were transferred to the abuse other than the extent that was before it.The discourse is in it a neighbor on the requirement of the phenomenon on both of the two peoples: the gathering of the masses and the gold of the silence.What is intended is from this news that is broken by the threat to afflict them like what happened to their lords of those who lied to the messengers, so it is an example for those who are shared.This is the first example that God has set for the two participants to the destruction of the destiny of their words, according to the words of the gathering in the descent of this surah.(P -273) And he disbursed them to the example of the parable with two parts with Moses -peace be upon him -; Because the college is among the people of Mecca and the state of Egypt’s people in the causes of symptoms from calling the Messenger is the group of what they are of worship of God, and what is good for them And the greed for the messenger of them with their grace that the likeness of them does not obey the same as it is as God told them to say about them, and they said: And their people have worshipers [the believers: 47] and the people of Makkah said if this Qur’an is revealed to a man from the two villages, a great man.The angels revealed to us or see our Lord, they have been arrogant in themselves and a great Atto [Al -Furqan: 21].He was repeated in the Qur’an, the example of the parable of the two people of my ignorance, and he is the leader of the one who is intended for the Prophet ﷺ and those who have been on the authority of him.The news confirmed (that); Because the addressees are denied that God sent them a messenger.And he denied a messenger; Because they know the meaning of it in these words, and because the regrets of the supply and theorizing are not the person of the Messenger ﷺ, but it is the characteristic of the transmission.And I am integrated into theorizing and reinforcing, and describing the Messenger ﷺ by being a witness to them.What is meant by testimony is here: the testimony is that God wants from the people, and that is a description (a witness) in accordance with the recovery of the description in the name Now with the benefit of the supplication and the etilation.As for the testimony of the Messenger ﷺ on the Day of Resurrection, it is a testimony of the sincerity of Muslims in their martyrs on the nations that their messengers have been informed of them, and they have given them the Lord, Likewise, we have made you a nation and a simplicity to be a testimony on people, and the Messenger will be a martyr on you [Al -Baqarah: 143] as he responded to detail Its interpretation in the authentic hadith, and it was presented in the cow surah.And the denial of (a messenger) sent to Pharaoh; Because the advertisement of the questioning, not the messenger, as the likeness is related to the questioning of his saying, as we sent us to Pharaoh, when you can be able to do so, as we can see it A messenger.And the separation of the pharaohs of the Messenger is a gesture until that is the supply of this news, which is the supply that it is permissible with the addressees when they disobeyed the Messenger ﷺ (P-274) And in the appearance of the name of Faruan in his saying (he disobeyed Pharaoh) without being brought to his destiny to call upon him the sake of his disobedience.And when the male of the messenger sent to Pharaoh, the first time he came to him in his remembrance secondly, once known to the covenant, which is the male and -mentioned era, that is, the male: If the denial, if it is repeated, is known as the first, it was the first eye.And the taking is used in the property.Because when he removed them from life, he did it, taking the time of taking it from his position and making him with him.Al -Wabel: A pharaoh is an analogy, similar to the place, if his passengers are destroyed or spent, and Zuhair said: ؎ To each of the stained -ranging, there is a bore The punishment is bad, and I want the sunset that hit Pharaoh and his people.
