The Quranic researcher (P-231) The pilgrimage is a well-known famous, so whoever imposes the pilgrimage in them, there is no journey, no veil, nor a new argument in the pilgrimage.And that I see that these verses were descended after we descended the Almighty saying: God has the pilgrimage of the house who is able to do it for a path [Al -Imran: 97] The verse was brought down with the abuse of the pilgrimage, and this verse is in it with his bias, and it is a delayed bias from the indicated, and the delay of the Bayan to the time of the pilgrimage is the same This verse was descended in a nine year, preparing for the pilgrimage of the Muslims with my father, Bakr Al -Sadiq.And among the descent of this verse, the descent of a verse, and the pilgrimage and Umrah to God [Al -Baqarah: 196] We have a three -year, so you will be - when we see - from the verses of the verse By putting it in this position from this surah for the collection between the pilgrimage and life.It is a gospel with the extent of the pilgrimage and its Sunnah, and what is entitled to be taken into account in his performance and reminding - what God wanted to do with him from his pillars and his rituals.The care of God has emerged with the great servants of this great worship; As it was simplified by its conquest and its conditions with the change of what the people of the ignorance entered into it.And the description of the most famous of the information is about what is known to the Arab The prohibited, and some of the most deprived of the most deprived; Because they were deprived before the pilgrimage on the day of the Hajj, a month and days, and they were deprived after the rest of the pilgrimage and the forbidden all, so that the most famous of the deprivation will be sufficient for a long time Their horizons, but it is righteous, but it was deprived of it.Because it is the month of Umrah.His saying: The pilgrimage is a well -known, meaning: in the most famous, because of his saying after him: Whoever is imposed in them the Hajj and for you to be able to do: The wet is popular.What is meant by his saying: The pilgrimage is a most famous that is to be a gift for his saying: So there is no puff nor the mourning of the time of the period of leaving the ravine For the difficulty of leaving that over the people, and for that I said with the gathering of the few, so it is a counterpart of what was narrated Rather, it is (P-232) ten telescopes, for if you get in your soul, something will be invited, and you mean the food The awareness of the most famous pilgrimage, for it is the counterpart of his saying: The number of months of God is twelve months [Repentance: 36] the verse, and it was said: for him.The most intense months are a shawl, the seat, and the argument is not other than, but they disagreed that all the pilgrimage is a month, or the tenth of the first of it, or the three of it, or the three of it, or the three of it, or the three of it One day From him, he said with the first son of Masoud and Ibn Omar, Al -Zahri and the Erwah of Bin Al -Zubayr, who is the narration of Ibn al -Munazir, on the authority of Malik, and he said, and he said: Hanifa, which is the narration of Ibn Habib, on the authority of Malik.And he said with the third -year -old, and the fourth is the saying of the money that Ibn al -Hajib mentioned in the victim, so it is not comfortable.And the release of the most famous of the two months and some of the most famous of the two companions of the two and the lifespan are the one who is released on the release of the group on the one or the one who is in the past or the one in the two years Or the Sunnah, as it is, as they said: Ibn Sennin for those who entered in the second, and the fringe The aspirations of the visit after a living, whoever sees it in the days of Hajj, did not see it blood, and whoever sees his disagreement sees his disagreement.And they disagreed with the pilgrimage before the pilgrimage, so he said Mujahid, Ata, Al -Awazi, Al -Shafi’i, and Abu Thawar: He is not fragmented, and he will be for him Before her time, and upon him: He must return the warrant from the meeqaat when the most famous pilgrimage is given, and the Shafa’i sought the words of the Almighty: But he is his deceitful, and he said, Malik, Abu Hanifah and Al -Nakhi: It is permissible to burn in all the Sunnah with Hajj and Umrah, except that Malik hated the Umrah in the rest of the Hajj; Because Umar ibn al -Khattab was forbidding that and hitting his deed with the path, and the evidence of your money in this is what he has passed from the Sunnah, and the niche he said: Say it is my time for people and Hajj [Al -Baqarah: 189], as he made all the people of the pilgrimage and did not separate, and this is weak and weak; In the verse, the whole of all the people is not permitted to find the pilgrimage, but rather the arms of the verse, that all the people are righteous for the vengeance of the wounds, with the time of the tawaaf, in the time Every work is compared to the appearance of the people to what is indicated by other evidence from the book and the Sunnah.(P-223) and to involve the verse is the number of people who are pregnant in the face of the mention of the famous pilgrimage.And the Almighty said: Whoever imposes the pilgrimage in them, a separation on his submitted all of the pilgrimage that the pilgrimage falls into it, and to build the most important rulings.And the meaning of (imposition) is intended and determined, the art of Hajj is the determination to him, and it is the warning, and it is involved in the intention with the money and the father of Hanifah He did one of his work as the interests of the guidance, and when Al -Shafi’i enters the pilgrimage with a structure, even if he did not accompany a saying or a work while he is more likely; Because the intention in worship was not involved in its comparison to a part of the worship of worship, and it is not different that the Sunnah is the comparison of the people of the misfortune and the abuse.And Zaid (in them) for the most famous; Because it is a gathering of a sane person, and it will run on the ritual.And his saying: There is no ritual, no veil, nor a response in the pilgrimage.Because the estimation is not spoiled.The spoiler, the immorality, and the rooted, exiled the genius in exhaustion in the end of it and its exclusion from the pilgrim, until it was made as if it had forbidden it, and it was forbidden, and it was forbidden, and it was forbidden, and it was forbidden, and it was forbidden.Many in the Qur’an, such as the Almighty saying: The divorced women are stagnating [Al -Baqarah: 228] and it is from the same way as the likeness of the case of the command, and the matter was the case, As if he had seen and did the commanding of him, he became in terms of being informed of him that he did as he decided in the scouts in his saying: and the divorced woman: The compound indicating the form that is likened to the likeness.The jams read the opening of the three words that are exiled by “no”, on (no), navigated for the Sen, a text, and the son of Katir and Abu Omar.And “a veil” is that (no) is the sister of “it is not“ navigator for the life, it is not a text, and he read and did not find the openness On a sentence, it was narrated from Abu Amr that he said: Raise in a sense: there is no journey or a veil, meaning that it was reported (no), and that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the source Raise to intend the sign of stability, like raising (praise be to God) and the words ended, then the negation began and he said: There is no newness in the pilgrimage that in the Hajj (no) The two readings are annexed in the end.(P-2334) Al-Raff: The prostitution of the words and the obscenity from it, Abu Ubaydah said it and he transformed with the saying of the lewd: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Ansar, joy and generosity, and what is meant by it is the kinetah from the proximity of women.And I think that the kinna with this memorization is without it to the intention of the two meanings; The wilderness and the serenity, and they were in the ignorance of that.So they made it said: The pronouncement of the people with spinning.This is a report that is intended for the exhaustion of the forbidden.The replacement of the circumstances of the virginity, and that is all the time of the warning, for if he gets a forgetfulness, then your money said is a spoiler and restores his Hajj if he does not spent the arrival of the nickname, The fact that the pilgrimage was exhausted in the pilgrimage and the overlooking in it, by cutting the view of the intention or forgetfulness, and he said, and he said.Al -Shafi’i in one of his words and the duplicates of Al -Zahiri: He does not spoil the pilgrimage with a guidance, and the spare of the women and the hadith in the matter of the permissible unanimity is the sake Because it distracts the heart of the cutting to the remembrance of God in the pilgrimage.And there is no jurisprudence of the elderly poetry in which the remembrance of the yarn; As the intention is not from the creation of the spoiler, and the son of Abbas has gone to it, and it is forbidden by a house in which it is mentioned.Do you go and you are forbidden?He said: The spoiler was what was of the women; That is, the action that is at the woman; That is, the intercourse.And the debris is known and the saying was presented in it otherwise, and it was said: He wanted it here is the forbidden from the sacrifice for the idols, and it is a matter Because it is related to the heights of what they were in the ignorance that the phenomenon is the inclusion of immorality for the piles of immorality, and the whole of the immorality has silenced in The period of war.And the consolidation of the picker, which is spoiled for the pilgrimage, requires that the immorality of the debt in the period of warning is spoiled for the Hajj like that, and I did not see anyone from the jurisprudence It is spoiled for the pilgrimage, nor is it other than the son of the son of Hazm, so he said in the local: that the appearance of the phenomenon is that all sins are spoiled for the sake of the However, the cables do not spoil the pilgrimage, and that the baptism of the spoils of the pilgrimage, and it is more frequent by its corruption from the proximity of women who are the permitted, and God knows.And the grandfather is the source of his argument if he resides in a severe symptom, and we have been talking to him when he said: Do not argue about those who are in the woman who are in the woman [107] As we missed him here.And he wrapped in what is meant by the newness here, and it was said: The insults and angry, and it was said: The Arabs argue with their disagreement in the stand; As each of them stands in a known and some of them stand in a group, and this was narrated from Malik.The scholars agreed that the knowledge of science and the correspondence in which it is not from the grave of the forbidden from it, and I heard from our sheikh the knowledge that the minister is not that The scouts put it in the kaaba in the period of Hajj with the intention of being used by the scholars who are attending the name, and he said: Whoever seems to him to argue with something Some of the people of science were subjected to it, saying: What did you say to the Almighty: There is no newness in the Hajj and that it was brought to it, and I believe that this is true that this is the time Its wagon; Because he saw him not separating between the veiled new seriousness and between the newness in science, and they agreed on that the argument in the denial of the denial and the residence of the one who is the same It is forbidden for him is what is running to the angryness and the sewn and contradicts the prohibition The pilgrimage, and for the sake of what is in the case of detailing, the verse was beautiful, while the pilgrims spoil from the types of new ones, so it is returned in the Bayan that to another evidence.And his saying: And what you do from the best that God knows is the prohibition on the prohibitions of the intention About him and do the good, so what you do, God knows, and the knowledge of God is released and I want to be obligated, and it is the reward for the knowledge of the way of the way of the kinetah, so it is the way of the one who is the one who says: So do not go out, etc.* * * and provide them, because the best of the piety and fear, O first people, are given to a sentence and what you do from the best of what he knows is what he knows.On the authority of the good deed, and the meaning: and more than the verb of good.And the supply of the numbers of the increased, which is the food that the migrant carries, and it is a derived act of a rigid name, which is the increase, as it is said that it is generalized and broken; That is: He made that with him.(P-236) The provision is a bothering of the denying the good deed, in preparation for the day of the penalty, likened to the missionary of the sake of the sake of the sake And the merciful to the dead.Al -Ashi said in his poems that he created to praise the Prophet ﷺ and he mentioned some of what the prophet calls for it, taking from this verse and others: if you are not You were up and met after death from the time you have provided that you would not be like him ∗∗∗ and that you did not observe what was the rest of it, so he said: Demonstrating; That is, piety is better than providing for travel, so they were kept on it.It is permissible for the provision to be used with that in its true meaning on the face With a people from the people of Yemen, they would come to the pilgrimage without any increase and say: We are reluctant to God, so they will be all over people.His saying: The best of the increase, etc.- is a sign of affirming the matter of providing it with alertness to separate it from piety; Because it has the watering of the face of the face and the offer.And his saying: And you fear the house of affirmation of his saying: The best of the piety is and only the saying of it: O my first, the dignitaries, until it is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is The minds.And the doors: the collection of a core, which is the mind, and the core of everything: the pure of it, and its action is for a coffee core - with the guarantee of the blame - they said: And in the words of the Arabs, then the words of the Arabs - And the harms of the heavily except this act, Sibuyah told him about Yunus, and Thalab said: What I know has a counterpart.He said it: The best of the increasing is the domestication of the tuning; That is, piety is better than providing for travel, so they were kept on it, and the signed of his saying: And you fear the first of the doors, to be intended to be provided with the right to the metaphor with the metaphor - the benefit of the matter of piety that increased the last with the appropriateness of the matter; For the sake of worldly piety.(P-237) The piety is a source of fear if it warns something, and the origin of it is the hearts of their jaa It was launched on the caution of the punishment of God, to follow his orders and the seizure of his talents, and it was presented when he said:
