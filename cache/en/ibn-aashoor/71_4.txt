The Quranic researcher, if God is postponed, if it comes, it is not delayed, if you knew, it is necessary for this sentence to be a prayer for it, and it will be delayed for it The link between the matter and his part is from his saying that they worship God [Noah: 3] to his saying and delay you etc.; Because the link between the matter and his answer is given with his understanding meaning: if you do not worship God and do not fear him and do not obey me, do not forgive you and do not delay you (P-191) The link and the obligatory between this is the estimated condition and between its parts in a sentence if God is termed if it comes not delayed, that is, that the time is the one who has the right They worshiped him and did not obey if he came to him with your will on the evil, and faith will not benefit you.Yunus, when they believed in our revelation of the torment of treachery in the worldly life and we enjoyed them until [Yunus: 98], so this is urged to hurry with the servants of God.For the sake of his saying, if God is term, if it comes, it is not delayed other than the sake of the one who is in his saying and delayed you for a name that is named and it is appropriate for that, the saying of his saying It is necessary that they do not know this fact that is attached to the deadlines of the nations appointed to release them, and as for the last time the deadlines of the nations are for the time Mashour in the first words.In the addition of (later) to the name of Majesty in his saying, if God comes, if he comes, no gesture is delayed that the deadline is not used to the sake of God, it is not the right of God to the people of God.It is permissible for the sentence to be a bias that arise from the end of the end of their delay, to a name named, meaning: without their delay, the delay of the other The one who is in itself from the cause of its delay is forbidden for another time, so it is the sake of God, other than the sake of the one who is in his saying to a nameful term.It is necessary for the sentence to be the highest of the two wages: the most beneficial from his saying before that a passionate torment comes to them [Noah: 1], so he said: A long time is long, and it has a vague period, not far away, and the term is removed from its saying and delayed you for a name that is called, so it is the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake Each soul is bound by the people.And his addition to God added a revelation, that is: the sake that God has appointed and destroyed for every one.With this, you know that he does not oppose between his saying and delay you for a name named and between his saying that God is the sake of God if he comes, it is not delayed either to the disagreement His saying to a name and his saying, if God comes, if he comes, he will not be delayed, or to disagree with the meanings of the delay in his saying if he comes, he will not be delayed, then he will turn away.(P-192) either The question of the last of the deadlines and the leadership in the life and the deficiency of it, and the deficiency of the wandering with us and the compensation of the sayings of the one who is disgraced in this person for a person who is one or a long time?That is an other case that is associated with two origins: the origin of the divine knowledge of what will be, and the origin of the fate of God for the reasons and the arrangement of its causes.As for what is in the knowledge of God, it is not changed.As for all reasons, the reasons for life, and the arrangement of its causes, and it will be changed by finding God, changed, and it is not a man For another.And in the hadith “The charity of the Muslim woman increases in the age”, which is a good hadith of acceptance.And on the authority of Ali on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ “Whoever broke his family to extend in his life, let God fear God and pray his mercy” and his bond is good, for the deadlines of the aged or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one or the one who will be in the age of the age.Members and the appropriateness of its movement is subject to the Ziyah and the deficiency.And the deadlines of the divine, the divine, the divine, the arrival of the punishment, is a short time, or in which it is not possible, and it is not possible for the last, and it is not true, and it is not true.It is delayed, and God said: God bless what God creates and proves, and he has the mother of the book [Al -Raad: 39] on the appearance of the interpretations in it and what is in the knowledge of God who does not.For the one who wanted Noah in it is the reason for the delay of their deadlines with God, so if they did it, they would delay their deadlines, and the last of it is that it is a good.They do what Noah calls them and that their deadlines are prolonged, and when they did not do it, he has revealed to people that God knew that they do not do what he called for them Their deadlines, and he referred to this meaning, the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “Do every easy entity to what was created for him.The knowledge of God and what God has appeared in the outstanding exit.And in the inactivity of the verb (you) before (you know), indicating that their work with that of those who are avoided for his struggles is a condition for a letter (if), a fulfillment of his fulfillment of his fulfillment, as well It was said that the people were wondering that we have insisted on a man from them [Yunus: 2] in Surah Yunus.(P-193) And the answer (if) is a deleted man who is not deleted.And appreciation: you have not been delayed.
