The Quranic researcher, or as a tray of heaven, has injustice, thunderbolt, and lightning, kindness on the precedent representation, and it is his saying as the same as the one who lost a fire [Al -Baqarah: 17] With other representations and with other descriptions, it is a representative of the state of dismissed hypocrites between the jawab and the vulnerabilities (P-315)- when the unjust When hearing the Qur’an and its guidance, and the virginity of evil from the souls of souls and ridicule with the Muslims - in the event of a trap from the sky, it was mixed with it, and it was disappointed in it.And he assured, he came on the way of abolishing the Arabs in the art of similarity while they are competing in it, in particular the representative of it, and it is a way that indicates the ability And widening in it.I have been able to seek their use, so they could have the kindness of the kindness of his similarity to his analogy as the saying of the qais in the attachment: I show you and his light with the words of the hands in my love, and it is clear, or the wounds of a monk ∗∗∗ The hopes of those who sought the slander, and the saying of the one who is not affiliated with it.الملالية A wounds in the reins, as if it were ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ or the darkest, and it is given to the one.It is like it or without the waw, or the impulsion of one of the two things or the things, and it will be born from the meaning Integration of wives, that is, to choose to like this, or with that, and that is like a saying of the good of the two preceding households: ∗∗∗ The pour of the phases failed and said the tumor in its similarity, the path of its authenticity: ؎ “ Mandalb and maybe they were sympathetic to Waww, as in his saying, God is the same as a man in which they are parties who are suspicious [Al -Zumar: 29] the verse, then he said: The verse.And his saying, and what is meant by the blind and the visionary [Fatir: 19], the darkness, nor the light [Fatir: 20], the shadow, nor the freedom [Fatir: 21] the verse.Rather, they may have gathered without kindness, such as his words, so that we made them a good harvesting [the prophets: 15], and this is a beautiful art in the words of what is wrong with you The analogy, as it is its pride in a single, is the dearest of its ability to repeat it.And it was sympathetic to memorize a sinner on the one who was criticized by the appreciation of the “like” between the Kaf and Siba.And the return of the likeness of the likeness with the letter of kindness that is enriched by the return of the worker, and this is a usager in their words and its good here is that there is a sign of the state The two who are similar to that we will show it, and they are mostly not repeating it in kindness.And the representation is here for the state of the hypocrites when their presence is the sitting of the Messenger of God ﷺ and their hearing of the Qur’an and what is in it from the one who is the return to their pride and the evil of the evil The representation is the case of the state of the state of the condition, which is represented in its saying, the same as the same as the example of the one who was criticized [Al -Baqarah: 17] with the vigor of release.His saying, or as a sinner, or as a disbeliever, who has a sacrifice, that is, as a people on the part of what was presented in his saying, as the example of the one who is the one who was lost.People say that they make their shock in their ears and his saying (P-317) whose eyes are hosted.Because it is not valid for the hypocrites, so he does not come in it in it what is permissible in his saying, God went with their lights [Al -Baqarah: 17] etc.The state of the hypocrites likened it to the state of the people who were brought in a night in the land of the people who were afflicted by the relief, and their people were in their silence as it was the same as the one who did not know.They are walked in it, so that the relief is the benefit of the people of the earth, and it did not become from what he was connected to from the throat and the thief is harmful, and the Marin is not beneficial to it and the one who has the goodness of it, and it is not the same And thundering and lightning, for the Lord is bothering for the Qur’an and the guidance of Islam and its similarity to the sheath and response.In the authentic hadith, “The same is the same as what God has sent me from the guidance, as is the same as the absurdity, and it was a land, so it was a pure from it.” And in the Qur’an, as a parable, the disbelievers are the fools of its plants [Al -Hadid: 20] and do not find a righteous condition for the representation of the form of a triviality and a boredom like the case The al -Qariwi, and from it the father of al -Tayyib took his saying: ؎ He died like the jewelry with the graceful and feared and righteously ∗∗∗ Al -Haydah from it and the fear of the thiefs and the shadows of the arrival of what is not.The disbelievers of the wilderness at his hearing, as the walking is in the night and the wildness of the clouds, because it is veiled from the light of the stars and the moon.And the pursuit of the Qur’an and its confrontations.And the lightning of the light of its guidance through the vowel, so it appeared that this compound is the most valid of the sequences of the suspicion, which is the highest.And the sinner, so it is from a young man who aims to be a righteousness if he descends with a strictness.The density of the clouds and the darkness of the night.It is clear that his saying from the sky is not a restriction for the Lord, but it is a description that is desirable for him to increase the increase in the image As the saying of the Qais: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Like his words, the exalted and not a bird that flies with his two sides [Al -Anam: 38] and his saying is like the one who has worn the devils in the land [Al -Anam: 71] The exalted, and he said that we have a stagger from the sky [Al -Anfal: 32] and the sky is called the raised atmosphere, so we are the one who is a dome of the ritual, and he said: It is a good tree that is fixed and raised in the sky [Ibrahim: 24] and it is called the clouds, and it is called the rain (P-318) itself, and in the hadith: Heaven, etc., and when the rain was formed from the ritual class, which is high in the atmosphere, it was made of the sky and the release of that in the Qur’an.It can be his saying from the sky as a pioneer of the Lord, either in the sense: from all the traces of the atmosphere if we say: The curiosity in the sky is for the sake of aspiration in the way of the people as a way that is the same A distance in it, when the entry of the imam of the expansion did not guide the oath of the darkening, except at a total name of the individuals without the name of each of the parts of the parts, so he needs to download the parts of the parts A counterpart in the recovery is known to him - so he who appears to me - if we make his saying from the sky as a restriction of the Lord - that what is meant from the heavens is above the rituals, and if it was from the rituals, and if it was from the rituals, and if it was from the heavens, and if it was Highly, it was more ascending, with the disagreement of the sides of the atmosphere and being close to the earth is not intended.And the "in it" is a pioneer to a sinner, and the perception is metaphor in the sense of it, and the shades are the saying in which it is a nose, and it is intended by the darkness of the darkness of the night The injustice of the night, and the clouds of the night is more rainy, lightning and called valid.And the pursuit of voices created in the clouds.The lightning is a luminous fire shine that appears in the clouds, and the throat and the lightning are raised in the clouds from a wild trace that is in the clouds, so if two clouds are covered in the jaw in the jaw of the jaw in Jaw As the last of the other, the most powerful of them was the weak, so it spoke with that of the lights in the air with a strong and speed, so the voice of the curtain spoke, which is a strong voice, which is the pious, which is An athlete from the act of anxiety, and it is obtained at that time of the sacrifices, and that causes the lightning of lightning.And you have learned that the sinner is similar to the Qur’an, and that darkness, thundering, and sparkling are similar to that we are bound by the return that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones The travelers are not the people of that house, so the verses are easy for the believers, as they find themselves, they are successful from being affected by them, and they will be worse It is applied to their conditions.* * * (P-319) They make their shock in their ears from the thunderbolts warning the death, and God is surrounded by the disbelievers.They rose up, even if God would have gone by hearing them and their eyesight.The likeness of it; Because it was beautiful, As for the sentence of lightning, it is permissible for her to be the same as the guarantee of “they make” because it is like the honor of the clarification of the form that is similar to it, and it is permissible for it to be the same The lightning resulted from the state of their condition at the throat.And the smoothness of the word, the smoothness of them, in which there is a state of lightning or from the guarantee of their eyesight, is not other than it, and in this this is similar to the reward of the two of the verses of the end of the end When thundering, lightning, and shadows, he fears his hearing, and he fears the thunderbolt, the warning of the death and the lightning of light Destroy his shine.Whenever he said, they have a representative of the conflict of the farmer who are in the case of the wilderness of the walking in the night, the dark, the shed.And his saying, and God is surrounded by the infidels, is to remind him that the intended is the same as the state of hypocrites in their disbelief, not for the exaggeration of the extermination.And his saying, even if God wills, gave them with their hearing and their eyesight, as long as the benefits of the hypocrites who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Return to the origin of the words, and the conscience of the conscience is the same.He expressed the exaggeration of the Qur’an with the thief and the decline of the hearts of the hypocrites, which are the visions of the decision of the light of faith in it with the supremacy of light Ibn Attiyah is a quotation of the preacher of the interpreters, and it is a great metaphor, it is said: So -and -so is hedge and blessed, on the fact that his building here is on the metaphor of the previous one, He gets the hypocrites of suspicion in the validity of them with the walk of the Sarry in a darkness if he lights up with lightning, and for their closure of that doubt about that With the dignity of the livestock at the lightning of lightning on the way of the representatives, and all of that is with a threat that is only suitable Sitting with the disbelievers and his saying, and if God wills, he gave them with their hearing and their eyes, so he came to this current and the one who is a meant.For the strength of the similarity of zags, the signs of guidance and faith in the heavenly and lightning in the arrival of the effects of the benefit and the harm from them with the art of rhetoric and the rituals of the truth.In the scouts, the three camels were made, and some of them were sufficient for some of the first to be in line with a sentence or as a sinner and the second, and it is almost the light of light.(They make) because the thunderbolts are the tenderness, and the third, and it is the same as they are lighting with them, and it is tired of his saying, and it is almost the light and the meaning of it, and the meaning is in it.I am weakened by some as we have seen a nose.And make and the harshs are used in their rights on the saying of some of the interpreters, because the ultimate is here in the sense of the nickname, And the custody does not require the surgery, so it will make some of the sakes in the ears, it is a making for the sake, so it represents some of the scholars of the Bayan with this of the verse Partial tolerance, and that is expressed by the owner of the scout by saying: This is one of the hours in the language that the conversation can hardly confine it like a saying [Al -Ma’idah: 6] So take their hands [Al -Ma’idah: 38] And from it, I said, I wiped out the moor Putting in the custodian, so it will be a word for the word “in”.And (from) in his saying from the thunderbolts of the reasoning, that is, for the sake of the thunderbolts, as the thunderbolts are the cause of making the Sabbaths in the ears, and there is no harm in the place of the elder The estimation of an added, as it is left and a violation, as there is no reason for it, and this is the one who said: The watering and the intended is its demise, as the verb is for its sake is the emitter and its existence on the verb whether it was with that of the verb, and it is the majority of it.And the thunderbolt is a thunderbolt collection, and it is a fire that is raised from the wealth of the withdrawals, as it is presented.And the warning of the death is an effective for his sake, which is here a cause and an end with him.And from the obedience of this representation that it is with what it contained in the group of the compound that is similar to the state of the hypocrites, when the rituals are removed from And it is supervised by what is overlooked by their souls from the acceptance of the prophet and its guidance with the sacrifices of the renovations of the disbelief and their dumping from them They leave their teeth, with that, with that, to separate the likeness in (P-321), its uniqueness to a similar one that every part of the whole is similar There is a part of the group of people who have a sinner with injustice, thunderbolt, and thunderbolts who cannot be heard with the hearing of its heart and fear the death of it and the light In their eyes, and they are in the life between the traffic and its blessings.And his saying, and God is surrounded by the disbelievers.This is a return to the origin of the wiseness, such as transgression in his saying, God Almighty gave their lights and left them [Al -Baqarah: 17] etc.As it is presented, except that it is here.The surrounding is a sense of the full capacity of the ability that the estimated is not missed by surrounding the surroundings on the way of the follow -up, or the one who is not.All of what indicates all the compound is indicative of the similar body, and this news has been used in his necessity, which is that it does not come to them and that it is rewarded for them.And the kidnapping Take a speed.And "the word" is a word that benefits the general in its entry, and it is all for each of the addition or it is a custodian or a disgrace that is described, so the general is in it.And the remembrance of “the word” is on the side of the lighting and “then“ in the side of the darkness for the domain of the word whenever they are on the walk on the walk and that they are standing in lighting, so they do not fulfill the time To see the way in their path to the strictness of darkness.It was illuminated by a packed and transgressive act by the contradiction of the meaning as it was presented in his saying, so when it lit what about it [Al -Baqarah: 17] and the darkening of the one who is used to do so A little and the most prominent that the lighting here is prepared, so it is a light that is deleted to the mourning of it, and it is fed by walking or the way; That is, the elegant lightning is light for them, and so, it is darkened, that is, and if the ritual lightning is darkened by them, that you are your mother and his light, then the darkening of the darkness is a metaphor.The meaning of the resurrection is the same as the walk, that is, the shelters in the position.And the saying of the Almighty, and if God wills, he would guess with their hearing and their eyesight, and he will be deleted for the answer to the answer to it If he is connected to what he reconciles, to be indicated by his acts, like his fall, a link to a person who is arguing to the news of the like: what God wanted, and it was no one: Its fall is a condition for the appearance that the answer is the evidence of the verb.Likewise, if it is in the previous words before the will of the will indicate what is indicated by the verb of the verb, we have the words of it, we will read you, so do not forget [the highest] (P-322) The sheikh said in the evidence of miracle: The rhetoric is that it will be deleted, and it may agree in it.The saying of the poet is Isaac al -Khuraimi, Mawla, the sons of Kharim, from the poets of Rashid, who is inherited by Abu al -Hudham al -Khuraimi.I did not have a blood that I cry for him, but the yard of patience is numerous and the reason for his goodness is that it was as if he was a wonderful bidder, that he was a good man The first is to declare his remembrance to decide it in the same breath, etc.His words.The owner of the scout followed him, and he increased it that they do not delete in the surprising thing when he said: They hardly highlight the effective in the thing that is alienated.It is based on the fact that his intention is that the numbers of the deletion then be many.And when the deletion is the basic for the sake of brevity, the ritual is a way that takes advantage of the answer, so the intention is intended after the thumb, and this is the majority in the words of the Arabs, he said: It is decreased, and if you want to be dismissed, and a veil shows the condition of the condition, the basis of the guests in the answer, we are the one and the words of the house, and if we wanted to take it, we would not take it.17] It is good for that if it is in the act of a stranger, then its remembrance is to express its report, as in the house of Al -Kharimi and the briefing, in every case, because it is from the first one, or from the one who is from it the second.The words of the imams of the suffering may be deluded that the deceased is obligatory, and it is not like that.The angels are a strange matter.؎ If you want, I hope that the one who is above its back is your servants and martyred your God, testifying, for if this is a grave claim.And the guarantee in his saying by hearing and their eyes appear to return to the companions of the sinner who is like the state of the hypocrites; Because the news can destroy the reputation and the vision that suits the people of the sinner, which is likened to them in terms of its saying that the light is almost, the light of it is shattered and shed.Their ears and the intended that the throat and the excessive lightning in the form that are similar to them are the rows and the lightning with a vigor, ending the power of their people, where there is no The hearing of his sins, and does not prevent the lightning of lightning from the disagreement of the sight of his eyes, except the will of God And the extension of the male of this in the case that is similar to that it is in the case of the likeness, which is the state of the hypocrites, so it is about to be the numbness of the intended with the hearing The most of their stubbornness and their symptoms from the truth, except that God did not see that a remedy for them and a mortal to increase (P-323) in sin or perfect for them, and for them to come to them, to whom they have to do so The formula of this meaning in these methods has been for what it is in the face of the threat to them, for them to go to God, their hearing and their eyes from their hypocrisy, if they did not start And that will have the fall of terrorism in their hearts, as it was fell asleep, Bin Rabiah, when the Prophet read to him ﷺ So I said, I will warn you, and I will be happy [Chapter: 13] It is not the intended of the “if“ if “in this condition is the benefit of what it requires“ if “from the abuse because it is not the intended of the media with the best of God The intended is the benefit of the abstinence, which is that the causes of the lightning and the pursuit of their eyesight in the seduction are wrap To see in the universe verses and the hearing of the laws, when they exposed the two of the two things, they were hated by the negative of the grace, except that God did not come For the pilgrimage to them, it was if it was used as a metaphor sent in the repetition of the relationship, to show the reasons for the reasons, if not for the existence of the municipality, the one who has the existence Salami ibn Rabiah is one of the hairs of Hamas, describing his horse.؎ And he flew before it.He wrapped in it because of the good.The meaning: If God would not go with their hearing and their eyesight with the increase in what is in lightning and thundering from the power, then he will benefit the dungeon of the throat and the brightness.It is for his saying that God is on all things that are strange.And his saying is that God is for everything that is destroyed, in which a nomination of the intended resonance is for the purpose of increasing their removal in their reminder, and to release them, For their excuses in the world and the hereafter.
