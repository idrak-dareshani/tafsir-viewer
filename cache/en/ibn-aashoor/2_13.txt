known to him, and he is not a dignity.Those who say to them: believe as people believe, they are their relatives or their own among the believers who did not spread their affairs, so it is not in the verse as a sign of the same With a used face, but it is something that I look at (P-288), on which his Prophet was, and you were reconciled in his secrets, and some of the believers may be informed of him With their mixing and knowing from the prophet ﷺ symptoms on the radio that of that, so the verse was not indicative of a legal rule that is related to the ruling of the hypocrisy.* * * Not that
