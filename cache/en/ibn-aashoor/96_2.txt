The Quranic researcher reads the name of your Lord, who created the human being from a relationship, read [Al -Alaq: 3].This is the first of what was revealed by the Qur’an to Muhammad ﷺ when you are proven from Aisha about the Prophet ﷺ from what will come as a relative.(P-435) And open the surah in the word (read), marking that the Messenger of God ﷺ will be a reader, that is: next book, after that he was not a book, he said: He recruited before him from a book [Al -Ankabut: 48]) That is: before the Qur’an was descended, and this is why the Prophet said ﷺ to Jabril when he said to him, read: I am not read.And in this openness, it is a consumption of the Qur’an.And the saying of the Almighty: (Read) is an order to read, and the readers are subjected to a certain words written or embarrassed at the back of a heart.And it was presented in his words of transgression: (If you read the Qur’an, seek refuge in God from the ritual Satan [Al -Nahl: 98]) in Surah Al -Nahl.And the command of the rule is used in its right to the request to obtain a verb in the event or the future, so what is required by its saying: (Read).The imitated approach is in the case, that is, to say what will dictate to it, and the consultation is that it is a matter of rule in the future, the closeness is that he did not provide the words of the words So his readers are asking for him, and a newspaper has not been delivered to him, so her readers are asked of him, so it is as the teacher says to the student: Written, and he will be written, so he will be written, so he will be written, so he will be written, so he will be written, so he will be written.To him.And in the hadith of Al -Sahahin on the authority of Aisha - may God be pleased with her - her saying in him: I said: I am not a reader.So he took me, so he covered me until he reached the effort from me, then sent me and said: Read.I said: I am not a reader, so I took me, so I was covered by the second one until I reached the effort from me, then sent me and said: Read, so I said: I am a reader, so I took me, so I took me Until the effort was informed of me, then he sent me and said: (Read in the name of your Lord who was created) to (what he did not know [Al -Alaq: 5]).To say it: He said: “I said: I am not a reader.” And all of what he mentioned in what was narrated by him, and I have said in it: It is upon him, that is: he returned to her, that is, with her liking.(P-436) It indicates that the Messenger of God ﷺ received what was revealed to him and read it at that time, and that increases the clarification of its saying in the hadith: Bin Nawfal, and I said to him Khadijah: O cousin, hear from your nephew.After the third cover (read in the name of your Lord) the fifth verses, it was read by an hour, as God commanded him and returned from the cave of Haret to his house.The face will be the saying of the king for him in the three times (read) a return to the descending memorial from God to re -repeat to the despair of the one who did not know.And it is not mentioned for the verb (read) an act, either because it is the descending of the house of the obligatory, and that the intended is the existence of the readers, or the appearance of the reader, and the absence Read what we will receive from the Qur’an.And his saying: (in the name of your Lord) in it in it.The first: that the opening of the words after a sentence (read) is the first of the reader, that is: say: in the name of God, so the moster will be for the sake His estimation: start.It is permissible to be attached to (read) the second, so that it will be provided for his work to be fulfilled by the name of God.The meaning of the use of God is the remembrance of his name when this reader, and the inclusion of a word (name); Because the use of the remembrance of his name is exalted, not by himself, as it is presented in the words on the name, and this face is required that the prophet ﷺ said: “He said:“ The second: That the Ba for the accompanying is the boundary in the position of the case from the one (read) the second is presented to his factor for the brother, that is: read what you will be.Your reading is the name of your Lord.The accompaniment is accompanied by understanding and observation of his pretext, and this is a proof of God's deity and heroes to call in the name of the idols that were the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one They say: in the name of the Lati, in the name of the dear, as it is presented in the name.This is the first thing that came from the signs of Islam, it was open to the first revelation.The third: that the B is in the sense of (Ali), as the Almighty saying: (Whoever believes in it with a carrier [Al -Imran: 75]), meaning: on a sneak.And the meaning: Read on the name of your Lord, that is, on his permission, meaning that the king came to you on the name of your Lord, meaning: sending from your Lord, so remember (name) on this.(P-437) And the name of God is amended to the adjective (your Lord); When the Lord is authorized to be authorized to be authorized to the head of the Lord, and to take care of it, with what comes with his remembrance of his addition to the guarantee of the prophet ﷺ in addition to the permission With his lobby, he has a response to those who made them yourself, and without God without God, then this verse was originally in the first place in Islam.He came in the description of the Lord with the way of the connected (who was created), and because in that, he is drained from the individuals of God with divine; Because this Qur'an will be recited to the partners for what the communication benefits from the gesture to the cause of the news, and if the cause of acceptance is on the remembrance of the name of the name of the name of the name of the Lord, it is the name The heroes of the domination of the remembrance of others, who are not a creator, so the participants were kissing the name of the Lati and the name of the dear, and the custodian of God is the Creator, who is the Creator.I asked them who created the heavens And the earth will say to God [Luqman: 25]).And the sentence (the creation of the human being from a relationship) is permissible to be a substitute for a sentence (who was created) with a detailed man A general effective, and the way of creativity is the way in which it is in it, as a result of the residence of the reciprocate of all times to the exalted; Because the place is the place of the hurry in the foundation of the religion of Islam.In the bound, bring the evidence with the conflict with the benefit of the blindness, and then the detail will be after that to increase the indicators of the evidence.And it is permissible to be a man from (who was created) if it is estimated to act (creation), the first is a verb that is indicated by him, and he will be the rest of the words: The human being created.And the same is the remembrance of a verb for the verb (creation), it is permissible for the deeds to be the verb of the house of the delegation, that is: who is the creator, and that it will be the deletion of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the creator, That is, he created all the creatures, and that his estimation is: the person who created the human being, who is used to what he returns after his saying: (He created the human being).(P-438) The creation of the human being was mentioned by the rest of the creatures; Because he is the ritual in the place of the recipient, as no one is forgiven by the same people from his soul, and they are not free of being dangerous for him to search for the one who created him and who created him That is why the Almighty said: (And in itself, do you not see [the dhmar: 21]).And in it is an illusion of the entrepreneur who have gone astray from God Almighty, with the fact that the evidence of al -Huddaniya is based on themselves.And in his saying: (from a relationship) a sign of what is found in the origin of the human creation from the phases and adjectives that were made by the authority of this land world.And the relationship: the name of a group of relationship, which is a piece of filling from the thick blood that remains the remaining wet, and it did not dry, so it was called that you like it.It is a garment that is in the sweet water, the blood is given from the animal if it is suspended in its skin, and it may enter into the mouth of the bear, and the mortar of the mortar It does not overlook it.And the meaning of (the creation of the human being from a relationship) is that the sperm of the male and the sperm of the woman after the confusion and a sufficient period of time, they are held, then if it becomes a relationship, then it becomes a matter The formation, the relationship was made the principle of creation, and the sperm did not make the principle of creation; Because the sperm was famous in the water of the man, if if the woman's sperm was not mixed with it, the relationship would not be associated, so the genes would not be created, and there is a sign of a sign until the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who created the one who is the one who created the one who is the one who created the one who is the one who created the one who is the same His destiny to the most intense is a creation that enumerates the power and capabilities A great great knowledge and writing.And from the miracle of the scientific Qur’an with the remembrance of the relationship; Because the constant in science now is that a person creates a very precise flood that is only seen by the old aged, weakening it in the beginning of its appearance.Praise be to the blood of the woman, so do not accept the creation until it mixes the sperm of the man, so you will be mixed with it, so it is taken in the creation, if it is not.(Creation and other creation [Hajj: 5]) If it is taken in creation and growth, its formation is fully, then the relationship that is in the water is very similar in the accuracy of the body and the fully With the color of the blood, which is swimming in it and in its place, it is swimming in a question, as it praises the relationship, and this may be presented in the Surah of the Bafir and I refer to it.(P-439) and the meaning of the (from) the appetite.And the first (read) is a certainty of the first (read) to the first thing to fulfill this matter.
