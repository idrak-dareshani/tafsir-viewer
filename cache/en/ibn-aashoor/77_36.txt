The Quranic researcher, and this day they do not speak and do not give permission for them, and they will be excused if the sign is on its appearance, the referred to it was the present day, and it is the day of the separation, then the day is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the day That day after his saying (they went out to what you were lying with [Al -Mursalat: 29]), and it will be in the resignation of their speech by saying that they will be done to On them, the tattoos increase it, by goodness that they deserved the symptoms of them after insulting them with a speech.This face is attributed to his saying after it (this is the day of the chapter.The storm that it was said by his saying (they went out to what you were lying to [Al -Mursalat: 29]), which is one of the phrase what is said to them on that day, and the name of the reference is in the name of the reference.And if the sign is to the mentioned in the memorial, while the day of the chapter is updated, that the guardian of the wilderness is in it, this words were directed to those who are directed at the one A warning to the participants from them and a wing of the believers, so the guerrillas of the unseen were a neighbor at its origin and were used to the lies of the lies of the lying [Al -Mursalat: 15]) The sentence will be inconvenient between a sentence (to divorce what you were lying with [Al -Mursalat: 29]), and the sentence (this is the day of the separation and the first of us.And the name of the sign, which is a sign of the closeness, is used in referring to him, after an adoption of the proximity of the hadith of it on the beacon of metaphor or tolerance.(P-440) The name of the sign is initial and (the day they do not speak) is a news about it.And the sentence (they do not speak) is added to it (a day), that is, it is a day known to the gossip of this sentence, and the number of norms (the day) is for the sake of its addition to the one who added it to the sentence.It is more correct in this costume and the like if it is added to a open sentence (no) that is navigated to be Arabized, and it is a highly harmed language.As for the shedding of the lower, they build it on the conquest.And they are composed (and do not give permission for them, and they will be excused) for a sentence (they do not speak), that is, they do not give permission for permission to excuse them, that is, they do not give permission for them.The apology is the intended in the negation, and it made the negative of the permission for them to slow down to the negation of their apology, and for that he came, so they would be excused, and they did not come to me, and they did not come.The negation is that the intended is not the denial of the ear and the negation arranged their apology for the negative of the permission for them, as there is no crop for that, so why did you not (So ​​they will be excused), equal to raising, but rather, with the disagreement of the like (they are not eliminated, and they will die [Fattar: 36]) So that the elimination of them is in them and they are in them.Because he was ahead of their torment, then I will answer that if they were spent on them, they died, that is, they lost the sense, The meaning of the answer is what is meant.Therefore, there is no need here to what Abu al -Baqa claimed that he would be excused by the inclusion of his estimation: so they would be apologized, nor to what Ibn Attiya said: The heads of the verses are similar, and after the stabbing of the denomination in the answer to the negation, the condemnation of the speaker is made by the deeds of the negation, not the regeneration A violent act.And know that it does not contradict this verse and between the verses in which it came to what is required that they are apologized for the words of his words So we gave us our sins, so they were to be broken from a path [Ghafir: 11]) because the time to fulfill them on the day of the chapter.As for the storyteller in his saying (our Lord, our mother is two years [Ghafir: 11]), then their screams in Hell after the day of the day of the chapter, and the day Nafaa ibn al -Azraq, when Nafaa said: I find in the Qur’an things that are different from me.Ibn Abbas said: They do not wonder in the first blow when we blow in the pictures, so he was stunned by those in the heavens and from the earth, then they do not wonder then, then in the second Some of them are wondering.And the one who collects the answer to (P-441) those verses and their proverbs is that it is obligatory to pay attention to the question of the units in achieving the contradiction.* * * And the night of the day for the lies is a frequency of the entrepreneur, connected to its saying (this is a day that they do not speak) He is a response to the appropriateness of his saying (this is a day that they do not trust) on the second of the two who are mentioned in it, so it is a confusion of his opponents of the end of the one who said: What you was lying to him [Al -Mursalat: 29]) to his saying a whistle that requires his punishment that his sentence is that a sentence (this is a day that they do not trust), etc.Its remembrance was not preceded, so it was a repeated (and the day for the lying of the lying [Al -Mursalat: 15]) after that it was necessary to provide the good for the one.
