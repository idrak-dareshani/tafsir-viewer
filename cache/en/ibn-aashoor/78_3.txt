The researcher, the Qur’an, wonder about the great prophecy in which they are different.The opening of the words is open to the question of a group of great news that opens a manner, then it will be eaten, so what will be reminded of it after it, then it is from the goodness of it.Dear, other than the dawn, and from the excitement of the style of the scattered, then the conclusive detail, so that the news that comes after it is possible after the soul of the poison.And if this openness is a mortgage of the great thing, it was a muezzin of confrontation with a saying that is separated in it, and when there was a notice of what is in it in the sense of the abundance It is from the mastery of the ruler.(P-7) And it was preserved (uncle) a compound of two words: a letter (from) the neighbor, and (what) that is the name of a sense of understanding in the sense: that is, anything, and it is attached to it () compound.And the origin of his installation: they wonder about what; The name of the questioner was presented because it only falls in the chest of the words that are accused of it, and when the name of the confesser was associated with the rituals of the rituals of the ritual The understanding was not separated from its bitterness; Become with, and he became: (What they wonder).The eloquence recovery has been raised that (what) are the arrogant, if it enters the rhythm of the run, the seal one is deleted with it, separating from it and between it.And on that, they were seized, so when they wrote the Qur’ans, they went on that separation in the brightness, so they wrote (what) the way of the way, Likewise, the Almighty said: You are one of its remembrances [Al -Naidat: 43] So when you preach, why did you give permission to them when they wonder what was created, so he did not.Except in anomalous.And when a word (what) remained after one thousand on one letters, they went in the drawing of the journalist on the fact that the remaining Mim is written with a ritual (from); Because (what) when a thousand were deleted, it remained on one letter, and the most likely was like the rituals, so when the navigator of the neighbor, which was before (what) was sealed by the son (What), and the Arabs are speaking with the dwelling noun that after it is meal and they are inserted into it, so when the noun was deleted in the sphere, they were drawn up.The noun is a follower of the lever, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: What was created [Al -Tariq: 5] and it is a good divorce.And questioning: a reaction, and the right to the form of reaction benefits the breasts of the meaning of the subject that is derived from it from the subjects to the verb, and the chests of the same from the verb, to the verb, to the verb.Because of the release of the occurrence of what I was derived from, we have said: He asked, in the sense of he asked, the napstel said: ؎ Ask from my happiness and the goodness of us.Seven as a ritual, and Ruwisheed bin Kathir Al -Ta’i said: O, the mixed passive, his stretch The voice (P-8) and comes to benefit the power of the verb from the actor, we say their saying: God has forgiven you, and that is either as a slander or a metaphor, and a metaphor, and the one who is in the authority of the verse.The three tiredness, and that is from the will of the Kinary meaning with the wise meaning, or from the recovery of the memorials in its truth and its metaphor, and both of the people in the words of the word To prevent him.It is permissible to be used in her right to ask some of them some of a pronounced question for knowledge; Because they were then still in doubt of the health of what they have mentioned, and then they stabilized their matter on denial.It is permissible to be used in the visual metaphor; They appear to the question while they are certain of the extent of the fall of what they wonder about, on the way of seeking the verb of the verb “warns” in his saying: He will warn A surah [Tawbah: 64] must be intended by the question.And the two philosophers went in both the two ways, each of the parties are more likely to go to it, and the face is carrying the verse on both of them; Because the two participants were varying in denying, so Ibn Abbas: When the Qur’an descended, a Quraysh was speaking among them; Some of them are believers, and some of them are lying.On the authority of Al -Hasan, and the likeness of the saying of Ibn Abbas, and it was said: It is a question of mockery or admiration, but they are certain of the denying.As for the right question, he asks one of them otherwise, some of the conditions of this news, so the questioner asks his question about a question about another case from the extent It is dangerous for each one in that mind that he has risked for the other, and he will ask a questioned question, or a question as a revelation of his believer, or what is described by him, or what is described by him The news, as some of them said to some of God, he fled to God as a lies with him a paradise [Saba: 8] and another said: If we are dirt and our fathers, we are for the sake of God: 67] This is only the myths of the first [ants: 68].As for the Syrian question, some of them ask some about this news, a question that is accused and mocked, so one of them says: Is there a word of the resurrection?And the other says to him: Did you hear what (P-9) said?The release of the question is true; Because it is a place for the same as that wearing, and their intention of it is not a realist, but rather a matter.And the understanding of what is in his saying: uncle they wonder, not a realistic understanding, but it is used to divide it to receive the news, we say: The devils are revealed [poets: 221].And the concern for the interrogation before the rhetoric of the other.And Zamir (they ask) may be the guarantee of the group of the people who are intended for the participants, and they have not prevented them with a remembrance in this words, but they are remembered in the Qur’an, but they are remembered Those who are intended to be intended from some of his guerrillas and signs, such as the guarantee in His exalted say: until she was hidden [p Involving the group of addressees.And when the questioning was used as to the request of understanding, his punishment is good by answering him by saying: On the authority of the great prophet, then he will be used to do so.In question from the integrity of the integrity of the prestige; So, the side of the preaching, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: I will tell you about the one who descends the devils, the descending of all the rituals of the rituals: On the authority of the great prophecy, and from it the saying of Hasan ibn Thabat: Who is the house who are close with the time ∗∗∗ Between the top of the rhymes and the values ​​of you, there is no way to the rituals of Jaf.The conversation of the costumes and the news: the news, it was said: divorced, and it will be anchored to the memorial, and it is the one who has been launched by the launch of the dictionary, the chapter and the tongue.Al -Raghbib said: “The news is the great of the great, the knowledge or the prevalence of a belief, and the news is not said to the news until the three of the thirteen is included.” Ah.This is a good separation, and I do not calculate the abolition, except on the part of what the rich said, so it is not said to the news about the usual affairs of a news, and that is what it indicates.The news was noted in the words of the abuse, and I think that those who released the extension of the news for the news, they sponsored what happened in some of the words of the people from (P-10).In the sense of the release of the news of the confusion of the interpretation or the missionary sent by release and piety, so there are many of that in the words a lot of hardship with it.The two words, but the most beautiful words are not appropriate for its graduation except at the most accurate assignments of the recipient.And it was presented with his saying: And he came from the news of the messengers [Al -Anam: 34] in the Surah Al -Anam and his saying: Say: It is a great news that you are from it.[67] The greatness is its truth: the great body and the lean for the important thing; Because the concern of the meaning is imagined with the greatest body in that it falls at its convergence, as the great body is seen in the eyes of the eye, and this is the arrogance the truth.And the description of the news with the great here is an increase in its identification; Because his being is and a response from the world of the unseen, he was more desirable and loose.And his counterpart is the Almighty saying: Say a great news [p.: 67], you are exposed to it [p.68] in Surah “p.”.And the definition in (the news) is the disappearance of the sweetener, so every great news includes the Messenger of the Messenger ﷺ with it, and the first of that is his exaltation that the Qur’an is the words of the Qur’an.Partnerships, and from the evidence of the people of the Day of Resurrection, so what is narrated from Some of the predecessors of the appointment of a special news that is carried on the representation; So Ibn Abbas: He is the Qur’an, and on the authority of Mujahid, and Qatada: It is the Baath on the Day of Resurrection.And the narration of the recipient with his saying: Did we not make the earth as a risk [the Prophet: 6] to its saying: and the paradise of the shame [the Prophet: 16] indicates a clear indication of the one who is the one) The news is that God is one that has no partner.And Zamir is in which they are disagreeing in which the deadly scored in his saying is running in it: they wonder and their disagreement in the news, their disagreement, as they describe it, as they say it.This is only the myths of the first [Al -Anam: 25] and some of them said: This is the words of two madmen, and some of them say: This is a lie, and some of them are: His consequences; For those who cut off the murder of the resurrection, like those who have told them to say: (P-11) and said those who disbelieve, do we show you on a man who is a man who will be done There is a new creation [Saba: 7] Except for thinking and what we are in the way of those who are in the way: 32] on one of the two interpretations.He came with the fatal sentence in the connection of the communication without saying: Who are the one who disperses in it or the part of that, so that the sentence is beneficial to this They are able to repent to them, for the edema of the nomadic sentence on the permanent and steadfastness.And it is presented (from him) on (exposed) to the boundaries of the passage, and to notify that the difference was the right to be attached to it, with what is in the past.
