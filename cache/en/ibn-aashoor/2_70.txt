The researcher, the Qur’an, say, "Call your Lord to us, show us what the cows are similar to us, and if God wills, they will be guided.A thing in which they said now that you have come to the truth [Al -Baqarah: 71] The saying in what is like a saying in his counterpart, then if God is the Almighty, he said that their words are in the language It was not known that he did not remain from the attributes that the purposes are related to it except dignity and breath, and if the one who is the one in the Qur’an is a disagreement of their words, then the matter is the matter.On the authority of God, he knew their intention, so he mourned them with it.And the sentence is that the cows are similar to us, as it is a bias, because they knew that their return to the question is signed in the same way as a question about the question.And they said that the cows are similar to us, an apology for the return of the question, but they did not apologize in the two first two times and apologize now because the third is in the ritual Confirmation and the mother, and otherwise, and therefore there is a lot in the conditions of humanity and their purchases of the time.He has come with a confirmation of confirmation in a news that Moses does not doubt in his sincerity, so he is aware that the two people are attentive to confirmation of the deceased of the righteousness, then the end of the end of the The meaning of the separation and the explanation, so it is useful that the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the separation and the causes, which is what Sheikh Abd al -Qahir took care of the alerts upon him in the evidence of the miracle of the miracle of the miracle I have a friend before the hybrid, that this success in the innovation is presented by its remembrance when it is the Almighty saying that you are the wise knowledgeable [Al -Baqarah: 32] in this.And he said them, and if God wills, you will be guided by a mediation and a promise to Him in compliance to activate to the supplication of his Lord with the two people and to pay off his life.In its words in its saying, then do what you are commanding and for the purification of the goodness of the intention of the many question, and that their intention is not the curses.Avoid anger at Moses.And commenting that God wills to discipline with God in returning the matter to him in the request of goodness.And the saying in the face of affirmation is that it says that it is a cow as a saying in his first counterpart.(P-555) and the humiliation of the conquest of humiliation is a reaction of humiliation by breaking the one in the source in a sense because it is easy.As for humiliation, it is the same, it is against the splendor, and they are the source of one of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The meaning is that it did not reach the age of it to move on it and to wake up with its mosquitoes, that is, it is a caliber that is a nearby hurry, which is the agreed upon that it is limited to the age of the year.There is no description of a cow.A sentence that raises the earth is a state of humiliation.The effect of the earth is its plow and the stir of the dirt that is dirty and its back is inside.I will be released on the verb of the excitement, similar to the mold of the parts of the earth with the effect of the thing from its place to another place, as he said, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same.And the counterpart of this recovery is his saying in Surah Al -Rum and raised the earth.Do not be watered in the place of a staple in the case.And the inclusion of (no) after the letter of compassion in its saying and does not water the plow with the fact that the letter of kindness on the exile with it is enriched by its return, but it is for the sponsorship of the And description or what is in it, in which a letter was entered, not as it was presented in the saying of the exalted, neither exhaust nor baccalaureate, for when he ranked the description of the one who was a boundary of the ritual The words are that it is a cow that does not enrich the earth and does not water the plow.It appears with reflection.And the reaction of the verb that is harmed in the influence and watering because it is the proportions of humiliation, as the description is youthful with the harms and because the harms are indicative of the case.And a Muslim, that is, a premium of the signs of its type.Building for the face in the verb and description, as it is not dangerous to the speaker, the aid, the act of that, and from this the greatest verb in which the adultery is in which the building is not.And his saying, there is no thing in which this cow is characterized by other than it.The mark is the age of an action of the garment of the garment, if it weaves colors and the origin of a thing and a thing, and the Arabs say a garment of brutal, dumb, and a thing, and the one who said Because in the provoles of the monster, it is a blackness that mixes its whistle, it is a wicker and its organs, their saying is a chaos.I am softened.It is a rift and a western.In the sense of disintegration of two.And his saying: Now you have come to the truth, they wanted the right of the constant thing that you do not invoke in it, as you say, it came to the matter of the matter on its face, and they did not want the right to be They deny their Prophet, because (P-556) said: Why did he mention here the words of the truth and what was said, they said: Now you have come to the two or the stabilizer.I said: Perhaps the verse has taught the meaning of what was expressed by the Jews of Moses with a memorial, which is in their linguistics.They are interested in the meeting of the righteousness in the address of their prophets and their arrogance as they were saying to the Prophet ﷺ Our shepherd, so we forbade us to say it O you who believe, do not say our shepherd and say that we see us [Al -Baqarah: 104] and they are for the few their grandmothers by understanding the partnership that they have been delusional that they are in the matter Currently, as if they thought the matter of slaughter as the matter of the law, so they made it described it with all the attributes, and they completed Moses When the attributes that the people of the people disappear are different from them in the cows, thinking that in the knowledge of the prophet in these worldly purposes, it is like it After the Bayan, with their saying now, you have come to the truth, as the one who is conducted to the later after the collection of the images of the question is now the answer.Perhaps they were not separated from the Tardi description and others in the legislation.Let the Muslims warn that they fall into the understanding of religion on something in which it is in which it is for those and they have come to the sake of it.
