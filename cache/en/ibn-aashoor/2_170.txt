The Quranic researcher (P-106), and if it is said to them, follow what God has revealed, they said, but we follow what our fathers have left for us.Followed by his saying and do not follow the steps of the Satan [Al -Baqarah: 168], for the intended by the speech in that are the partners, so they are those who are not.And Al -Fashbiyyah, especially that they say to God what they do not know, and Muslims are gathered from the group of that.In this given verse, an increase in the state of the people of the polytheism, after that they have proven to them, follow the steps of the Satan, as they forbade them from the same This is followed by the remembrance of their symptoms, those who invite them to follow what God has revealed, and they are clinging to the integrity of their violators, what they have fulfilled to them, and they will be blessed with them, Without contemplation and not arranged.Rather, adding the heroes, that is, they were forbidden from the saying of the Messenger: follow what God has revealed, adding symptoms with an argument, except that it is contrary to what they have fulfilled.And in the guarantee of the tattooing of the rhetoric, which is in its saying, and do not follow the steps of the Satan [Al -Baqarah: 168].What is meant by what they have fulfilled their fathers, what they found from the things of the evil as they said that we found our fathers on a nation and we are on their effects.The worship of idols.And his first saying, even if their fathers were not reasonable, nor do they guided words from one side of another to respond to their saying, we follow what we have to do with our fathers, for our fathers, for our fathers.About them, they say this with an understanding that the response is intended, then it is surprising, for the prodigy is used in denial, as it is a nakedness, and the intended, and the intention is not to be.In the sense of negation.And “if” for the condition, and its answer is deleted, which is the previous words that are able to fate: do not follow them, and the one who is accused of it is the link between it The gambling of the response to the sake of knowledge is that the one who is accused of it is answered by him with the evidence of the readers of the state of the expert and the accused.And like this is the composition of the bodies of the Arab calamities and the highest and the highest of them, and “if” in the same example, it is called a prayer and as well as “if you fall into the fall of“ Waw and the condition of the condition in the same parable of three sayings: (P-107) The first saying: It is for the state and the son of Gin and Al-Marzouki and the owner of the scouts, said the son When Amr ibn Maadi Karab: The camels are not in a misery, so know that if you respond to a cold and a part of it, the house of the book is: Waw and after the point of the place, as it is, as it is, and what is after it in his saying: If you respond to a cold, the position of the place is from what is before it, and it is the one who is before it, I am good at me, thankful to me, and they are desperate and complained about the case in the case of the condition, and they are in the sense of the condition and what was before them is a deputy from the answer to them, not for them.In your visit, and if you thank me, I would have improved to you, and I asked once a father on the authority of his saying: ؎ And he died in that for him to what we are in his edition, so I saw him like the manufacturers in the answer, not limited to the praise of God from him, but he is a lumin Hanal: His saying, and if you respond to a cold in the position of the case, as if he said: You are not beautiful with a murdered mortal with him, and the situation may be, as is the case of the condition, as is the case.In it in the sense of the situation, the first is like your saying: I would not have done it, that is, if this is this or if it was that, and the second is the book of the book: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ وإن mar, and if it is a matter The situation of the case, as it is in the house of Amr, in which the condition is preserved, its meaning, and what was accepted by the deputy of the answer, and its estimation: its perpetrator is a time, and it is a matter A balance is not the beauty of that uh, and the owner of the scouts said: In this verse and in its counterpart in the Surah Al-Waw Al-Waw (P-108) for the case, then the appearance of the words The case is in the same way from the mentioned sentence before the waw, which is the white of the good and the servant of the wise, and the owner of the scouts went to the case that the case is from the case of a sentence Its appreciation: you follow them, and if their fathers were, and on the advertisement of waw or the case, the understanding of the questioner is in his saying, even if their fathers would not be from it.It is with her with kindness and fulfillment, and then, but the hamstan is within the current sentence, because the denying place is that situation, and that is in the scouts in the script of the water: She entered the thunderbolt of denial.It is estimated here and in the extended deletion, it is the entry of the gossip in the estimation, which indicates what he accepted, and his appreciation here is: they follow their fathers and destroy it in Surah: that?This is a disagreement in his opinion.The second saying: that the waw of kindness was said to the advanced sentence, and it is the goodness of the white and I do not know a predecessor in it and he is very good, that is, they said: Their fathers, and on it, the giving sentence is a way that is from the words of Al -Haki as in the verse; That is, they say it in every case, and if their fathers were, etc., then it is the coming of the emoters from my words, speaking, the kindness of the two, as it was presented in the saying 124] And, and it will be from the words of the first words of the first words, as in the house of the hamstah and the house of the book, and a time that will be from the words Like the saying of a department: The daughters of the cousin said, O Lord, and that it was a numerous manner, she said, and if the kindness was said to a sentence of deletion, and the luxury of the one who is satisfied with the one At a condition, contrary to the conditioned condition, and the ability: they follow them if they are reasonable and guided, and if they were not reasonable and did not guided you, they are not guided, and they are guided and guided in We are from the groans, and this is the neighbor on the Sunnah of the Arabs who have in his curves for the lightness of his affiliation.The third saying: the choice of satisfaction is that the waw is like it for the symptoms, either in the last of the words as it is here or in its stretching, and the symptoms are not the meaning Return to Wow.As for the condition, which is the condition of this waw, let him be the location of the case, the conversation or the synthesis of the words of the past, other than the condition, which was the meaning of the condition, the meaning For that, the grammarians differed in that it remains in the sense of the condition, or it was disturbed by it to a new meaning, so the words of Ibn Jinnah and al -Murzuki appear to be the words of the son They approach the condition of the condition in the sense of the situation, they come to the face of the gathering between the statement of the sentence (P-109), in fact, and its condition is conditional, and it is the money of the good The truth, and the direction of the condition in it is that the words that he before it if he is mentioned in it is judgment and mentioned with it what indicates the existence of the reason for the referee, or for that There are many conditions, including what is thought that the captain will be left behind, because it is to provide what it contradicts with it, so they come with a prestigious sentence, or a prestigious sentence (or a mandate) On the link and attachment between the state, which are the one who thinks about the causes and between the verb that is caused by that situation, because the sentence of the condition is the one who is the one who is the condition of the condition.On the causes, and they seek to be able to mention the part of the part because it is known from the origin of the words that followed the condition of the condition.Rather, this type was summed up with two letters, “If there is a“ in the words of the Arabs to their paths on the scarcity of the condition or its abuse, unless it is that if it is the same If you were brought up by Amr, and if it was forbidden to get in the same matter, they came with him with a little, as in this verse, and perhaps they came to the condition of the condition of the condition of A close proximity, so it will be the seizure of it, even if it is a metaphorical metaphor.And a group went to the fact that “if the one is“ in the same way as this prestige, they came out of the condition to a new meaning, and the appearance of the words of the scout in the saying of the words of God And if you like their goodness [Al -Ahzab: 52] that “if” it is for the supplication; As he made it easy to say: I like it, their goodness is, and the owner of the scouts said here: The condition is like it for the extension of the priority, and it does not Answer to correct it for its exit on the meaning of the condition, but they appreciate the answer to clarify to the meaning and a parallel to it.And the late ones called the grammarians, “If there is two and two prayers, and his interpretation was interpreted in the one who takes as long as they are in the way of the righteousness and the ride.And when you have achieved the meaning of this condition, then we have indicated the face of the right to the comparative waw, for which the different of that is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was Wow is considered one of the words of the words that before it, so there is no suspicion that the waw is for the condition and that it is the meaning that is the predominant and it is the majority, and if it is not after another words, it is not.She has complied with the first words of the first words in the sense of the two, and that is, as in the saying of the Almighty, say, or if they were not reasonable, nor do you not understand anything We are the same as its interpretation.From the first sentence of the first words, but it is an perspective in it to the answer of a question that is dangerous in the poem, the waw of the Bayani, who crossed the satisfaction of the satisfaction Kaab Bin Zahir: Do not take me with the sayings of the inscription and not ∗∗∗ I am a sinner, and if it is more in the saaka, then the condition of the condition is in it.Respond to a question that says: I deny your soul.The saying has many.And his saying does not understand anything, that is, they do not realize anything from the jokes, and this is exaggerated in their commitment to sin in the followers of their fathers on the authority of others Say in the word of something.It is attached and does not guide a deleted, that is, to something, and this is the case of the same thing; Because their fathers have a mind that perceives things, and some of them are the same as their guidance to prove the existence of God Almighty, and to some of what they have for them Al -Malahouf, the villages of the guest, and the memorization of the covenant, and the like, and this is the right of the "if the conditional" if the condition is here.I have seen the words on “if this”; Because the words on it are not found in the books of gravity, and I have been cursed in it.And this verse does not have to be attached to the rulings of the guidance and imitation; Because it is a defamation of those who refused to follow what God has revealed, and the imitation is the imitation of the followers who are not the descending of God.
