The Quranic researcher will ask you about the family, say it is the time of the people and the pilgrimage is a synonym between the bodies of the rulings that return to the regime, called for what happened from the question I descended because one of the Jews asked a supporter about the people and its conditions in the accuracy until it becomes a period of time and then decreases until you are afraid, so he asked the sins.So this verse was revealed, and it appears that its descent is delayed from the descent of the verses of the imposition of fasting with a place of two years; Because the righteousness is that the righteousness is that you will come from its appearance, connected to it.It will come that that verse was descended in the year of the Haddiyah or the year of the Umrah of the cause, so the appropriateness of its place in this position is the one who has been lost in the fast, so the one who is the one who is the one Remembering the verse of the Islamic college system on the full face.And from the amount of the regime, it is the firmness of the leaflets, and it appears that this verse also came down after the pilgrimage was made; That is, after the angry of the Mecca, it is the Almighty saying: Say it is the time for people and Hajj.The verse was initiated by (they ask you) because there is a question and signed about the matter of the Ahli, and all the verses that were open to (they ask you) are the ones who are in the past So it will be located in the Qur’an with verses that are appropriate for it, which came down at its time or has been held by it.It was narrated that the one who asked him about that Mu’az bin Jabl (P-194) and the Bin Bin Ghanmah al-Ansari said: “The crescent is not clear, then he increases, then it increases, so it is more He decreases until he returns as he started, Al -Iraqi said: I did not stand for this reason for chain of transmission.And the guerrilla collected in his saying: (They ask you) with the narration that the one who asked him as a man, given that the questioner about him is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same; Because it is the arrival of the regime, that the questioner would be among the people, and many of them have been honored for his knowledge, whether he asked whoever asked, who asked him, And the benefits of the creation of the people mentioned in this place of gesture that God made the pilgrimage a time from the most famous, and he did not accept the extermination, and that is a gift for the sake of the ignorance of what was Women in the most famous pilgrimage in some years.And the question: One of the last one is asked for something or a news, then if he asked for the sake of the enemy, then the question is the question of itself, and if he asked for a good news, or the one who is a good news) Its deposit is repeated, and this surah has been repeated in this surah, which are open verses (they ask you), which is seven verses that are not far away from some of them, some of them came from some of them, and he came to each other.The compassion is the fourth, and some of it is given to it, which is the three of them, and it is not the openness of the ritual of the compassion, so there is no need to show it from the emotion; Because it is in the end of the rulings that are not compared between them and between the sentences before them It was a new chapter without kindness, and it was not required for it except for the occasion.As for the three eagerness, which is open to the emotion, each one of them is comprehensive of rulings that have more communication with the guarantee of what he accepted, so the question was in it, so the question was in it He was arising from the one before it, and it was true by the origin of the rudder of kindness, as it would be shown in its arms.The question about the people does not relate to its dhimmis; For the souls are not asked except for their conditions, so he knows here appreciation and deletion; That is, on the authority of the people, so the appreciation of the question of the question is that it is not possible.With his saying: Say: It is a time for people a neighbor on the question and to this, the owner of the scouts went, and perhaps the question is from the question at that time, then it is the same Why did they get on it; Because her time is not what is hidden until he asks for it, then he is a manifestation of them, so he is appointed as what is meant by their question, if it is a person who is a person who is sufficient For the lawful intended.And if the question is about the reason, then the answer is with his saying: Say: It is the time (P-195) is not the same as the question, so it will be a delay in the words of the convergence of the one who is satisfied.He is required, alert him that what was not known to him is the important thing for him; Because they are on the principle of new legislation, and the questioner is the Messenger upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, and the one who is important to them was to ask him what he benefits from them in the goodness of their world, and they are the best of them, The people were arranged on the deadlines of transgressions and worship, such as Hajj, fasting, and enemy, and for that, they were shrouded from the two people of their affairs to the end of the last one, not the last, and not, not Showed to perhaps the circumstances of the heavenly boundaries, and those who are not among the origins of the knowledge of the form of the form of what will give them to the understanding of what they wanted to know.Their teaching is called up to that knowledge, if he had exposed the owner of the project to his statement, to show things from the truths of the knowledge, and they did not Their minds are accepted by the day, and that was an offspring to stab the entrepreneurs and the hypocrites of his deny His grooves are like their saying: Do we show you a man who predicts you if you are torn apart.And their saying: We have not heard of this in the last of the deadline, if this is nothing but a separation [p.7] and on it, then this answer is by saying: It is the time of the people of the people The disagreement of the requirement of the phenomenon as the saying of the poet; I shed it in the key and did not attribute it, and I did not stand on his saying, and I did not see him otherwise: I came to disqualifying me from the villages, and you have seen the savings, and I did not.The key, as if it was based on it that they do not think about the question about the rule in the creation of the family: to appear it, and that the one who is in the story of the one is forbidden and a good man As they said: The crescent does not seem to be talked, etc.And the eligibility: the collection of a crescent, and it is the moon at the beginning of the sun of the sun every month in the first and second nights, it was said: the third, and whoever said to the seventh, but he wanted to the seventh; Because the crescent is similar to the crescent, and the crescent is called the moon for six and ten times, seven and ten; Because it is in the destiny of the crescent in the first month, but the crescent was called a crescent; Because if people see him, they raised their voices with the news of it, and some of them call for some of that, and if he is and who is in the sense of his voice as he said, as he said: For the other hand [Al -Baqarah: 173].(P-196) And his saying: I have been taught to people, meaning: I have been taught to what I have been in their business, so the blame for perhaps; That is, for the benefit of people, which is on added estimation, that is, for the work of people, and the task of the people did not remember the people, so that the words include all the work of the work, and the work of the The pilgrimage to the people with the advertisement of the deleted from the special kindness of the year to be fulfilled by it.And the pilgrimage to the vengeance is a warning; If the people did not come to the pilgrimage, they were not satisfied, and the intended did not get their meeting, and they did not find what they needed for them in their travels In Mecca and its markets; With the disagreement of prayer, it is not long for the family, and the difference of fasting, for its trust in the glory of it; Because it is a worshiper that is defined on self The costs are, the difficulty is afraid of meeting, and for their condition in that time is similar, so no one will make one another in the disagreement of the lengths of the greatest, the most and the people.And the vessels are the collection of meeqaat, and the meeqaat came with the weight of the name of the machine from the time, and the Arabs called it the time, and the month was called a month of the month.Because he who sees the crescent of the month is famous for people.The Arabs called the appointed time as a meeqaat as if it was a lame, otherwise the time is his eyes, and it was said: The meeqaat is more special than the time; Because it is time in which there is a work of work, I said: He should have its formulation in the form of the name of the machine, in order to be adapted that that is the one who is the one who will be the same As if it is a machine for the dust and the restriction on the pilgrimage without life; Because the Umrah is not time for it, then it will not be for the people who are increasing in its action.And the coming of the mention of the pilgrimage in his verse, and it is one of the first things that came down In the city, and the Muslims were not able to perform Hajj; Because the participants prevent them, indicating that the pilgrimage is fixed, but the participants are without the Muslims without and without it.And he will come when he said: He will have the pilgrimage of the house [Al -Imran: 97] in the surah of Al -Amran, and when he said: The Hajj is the most famous of the knowledge of this: [197] * * * (P-197) The righteousness is not to come to the beast from its appearance, but the righteousness is the one who feared and the pea came from its doors and fear God, perhaps you will come to you And it is not given to a sentence that is my time because it was not what they asked about until it was a saying of the respondent.And the appropriateness of this sentence for those before it was that it was descending it was loyal or compared to the reason for the descent And forms of them from his matter to ask about it, so if they were forbidden by Hajj or Umrah from their country, they made it one of the rulings of the forbidden, not to enter the forbidden from it A stiffness between him and between the sky, and those who were forbidden if they wanted to take something from their homes.Those who are the people of the length, and if they were among the people of the tents, they entered the successor of the client, and the supporters were condemning that, and the sense is not, and they did this, The one who is tightened in the matter of religion does not violate it, and they are: Quraysh.Knight.Khazia.Authenticity.Ghuma.And the sons of Nasr ibn Muawiya.And a sign.And aggression.And a muscle.And the sons of Al -Harith ibn Abd al -Manaf, and the sons of Amir ibn Sa`sa, and all of them from the inhabitants of Makkah and forbade it, what is the same as the son of Amir ibn Sa`sa, then they are the same The meaning of the negation of the righteousness from this: the denial of being a legislator or from the Hanafi, but it was not legitimate; Because it is a threshold in the actions of the pilgrimage, then the pilgrimage, even if it is included in the reactions of the leaving of the body from the body as the killing of the stitches and the leaving that is covered The intention is from the legitimacy of the aids of people, but rather the purification of the extension and the leaving the depletion, and this is not the sense of the senses that do that; Because they are close to the religion of Abraham, the negation is in its saying: and the righteousness is not the denial of the righteousness of this action, with the difference of the saying of the righteous: [Al -Baqarah: 177] Al -Qarnah here is his saying: They came from the gates of its doors and did not say here: and accept any side of you It was reminded of the letter of the custody in the two verses by cutting the view of what was denied by righteousness, and this is the areas of the suspicion and the burning between the two verses.The one narrated in the causes of the descent that the Prophet ﷺ qualified the year The city is that he entered a house and that one of the supporters was said: His name is Qutbah ibn Amir and it was said: Rafta ibn Tabout (P-198) was that he entered the house of the house from the house of the house of the house of And the Prophet said to him ﷺ: “If you did not enter and you have been forbidden?Then the supporters said to him: You entered, and you entered your entry, so the Prophet said to him: Religion on your religion, I was satisfied with your guidance.His heights, and in the interpretation of Ibn Jarir and Ibn Attiyah on the authority of the Saddi, what violates that, which is that “the Prophet ﷺ entered a chapter while he was forbidden and was with him a man from the family of the people.” And he said: I am more desirable, so the Messenger said to him ﷺ: And I am more firm, and the verse was revealed, so this narration requires that the Prophet declared the heroes of the entry of the people of the Those who were entering the house from its appearance, and I say: The correct one of that was narrated by Al -Bukhari and a Muslim, on the authority of Al -Bara ibn Azzib, who said: The supporters were not.The chapters of their homes, but from its appearance, a man came, and he entered from his door, as if he was reference to that, so this verse was revealed, and the narration of the Sad.That the Messenger of God commanded that and it is not thought that this would be from him, and the context of the verse contradicts it.And his saying: But the righteousness is the one who fears the saying in it as the saying in his saying is up to the Almighty: but the righteousness is the one who believes in God and the last day [Al -Baqarah: 177].And (feared) is a sloppy act.Because those who are intended for those who describe the legal piety in compliance with the affairs and the seizure of the prohibitions.It was done that you come with the increased splendor to confirm the negation of the people, and it is necessary to affirm the negation that they thought that this exile - from the righteous The same is the negative of this thinking.And his saying: They came from the gates of its chapters, which are given to a sentence, and the righteousness is not the same Because he said: The righteousness is not [Al -Baqarah: 177] in the sense of the forbidden from that, and it was like a kind of time at the end.This verse is aware of that it has been descended in a year of five when the Prophet ﷺ was broken up to the life in the seat of five years of juvenile He intended to perform Hajj (P-1999) with Muslims if the participants did not repel it, and it is began to have come down in Dhu al-Qaddah or before it with a few.And the jams read: (Al -Bayout) in the two people in the verse by breaking the Baa on the dispute of the form of a group of acts on action, so it is a break for the appropriateness The movement of the annexation of lightness as they read: (Ayoun), and Abu Amr and Rash read it, on the authority of Nafaa and Hafs, on the authority of Asim and Abu Ja`far in a guarantee The origin of the collection form is with the number of people who are more than a threat; Because he does not reach the extent of the heaviest of the heavieh to change the movement, Ibn Al -Arabi said in the capitals: He who chooses him for my soul if I read the sacrifice of the warehous The gambling is that I leave it originally, except when it transmits the meaning or wore it, and I do not break B Surprisingly some of the readings are offered to each other.The disagreement of the readers was presented in the text (righteousness) from its saying: the righteousness is not [Al -Baqarah: 177] and in the tightening of Non (but) from his saying: but the righteousness.And his saying: Fear God, so that you may be successful, that is: you will be wrapped in your demand from righteousness; The righteousness is in the follow -up of the law, so do not do anything unless there is in it the pleasure of God and do not follow the steps of those who are invited to those who have increased in the pilgrimage that is not from the pilgrimage that is not from the pilgrim.In the interpretation of the verse, it is the faces of all other things, and it was said: His saying is: and the righteousness is the example of God, for what they were to come from, and he said: A real dimension, metaphor and meaning; Because the verses are a discourse for the Muslims who were the ones who asked about the people, and the human being is one of the conditions of the people of the ignorance; Because it is a misery to a nursery, and it was said: an example is made for their question about the people who do not know, and command them to spoil the knowledge of the knowledge of God From before, and it was said: They were warning if they were difficult for them, their demands would not enter their homes from their doors, so they would be from that, and this is far from me; Because the words are with the Muslims and they do not do that, and a bond; As no one has seen that this is the reason for descending.
