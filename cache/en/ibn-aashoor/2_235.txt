The Quranic researcher (P-450), and there is no wing on you, as you presented it with the speech of the women, or you are in yourself, may God know that you will remember them, but you will not be.A well -known saying and do not intend to do the contract of marriage until the book is attached to the best of the sentence before it, so this is one of the rulings that are suspended The verses before it are the rulings of the number of divorce, and the number of deaths, and that the enemy is a conflict, and that the divorced women, if they reach their abundance, may do what they do in The well -known, then he knew that if they did not reach it, then it is permissible, so the husband is in the period Getting the marriage, and it was their habit of serving the rhetoric of the aggressor and its domestication, keen on the release of it after the elimination of the numb It was forbidden, and she was made up in something of it, and that is compassionate this words on his elder.The lying wing has been presented in its saying, so there is no wing, and it must be wrapped in them [Al -Baqarah: 158].And his saying that you presented it with what is connected to it, and what is true of it, that is, the words you presented to it, because the exposure is called a warning from the darkest of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.By saying it from the sermon of the women, it indicated that what is meant is words.And the subject of a verb in which there is a significance on the sake: the same as the images that are derived from the presentation by adding the eye, which is the side, that is, he made his words with the guilt, and the sinner is the one who is the one who is the one who is He neutralizes his words from the seriousness of the meaning to a side.And this is the one who said it, that is, he made it on the side.It is that the one who speaks of his words want something, and it is not the same as the installation of the installation, for the occasion between the words of the words and the one who is between the words of the words, between the words of the words, between the words of the On the will of the exposed meaning, he has known that it is necessary for the occasion between the words of the words and between the intended thing, and that is the occasion: either a mandate, or the same, or the same The well -being, for a generous man: I came to Islam to you and look at your face, and they have expressed their wills like this, the mother of the son of Abu al -Salad in the saying of God: One day is enough for his praise (P-451), and the good one of him made his saying to the Almighty, and if God said, O Jesus, the son of Mary, you said to the people who took me, and I have taken from me.[Table: 116].The normal sense in the same way is the same as the mandate, and the saying of the saying: the Muslim is from the Muslim of the Muslims from his tongue in the presence of those who are known to the one He has the knowledge of people with the same state of the person who is intended for the condition in which the meaning of the words was mentioned, and when the similarity is young with the mandate, because the angels are in the same time It is compared to the presence of its ideals, it is true that we say that the nursing meaning, with the lineage to the compounds, is young in the Kinary sense, with the nap You said the dominance meaning before the kinetah by the compound, so it was specially in the name of the exposure, as the Kinary meaning is before the kinetah by the unique memorial.And on this, the exposure is one of the followers of the attributes, and this is the metaphor of what the owner of the scouts is required in this denomination, so the exposure has it, and it is for the sake of this He likened it to it, and that is why he needed to indicate the difference between them.The lineage is between them, with it.As for the silence, he made some exposure from the kinna, which is the wound, and the lineage between them is the general and the deserted privilege This is, nor his acemmer, he carries it.And when you have found the meaning of the exposure, and you taught the limitation of the difference between it and between the erasing, then the example of the exposure and the frankness is not hidden, but it is from the effect A forms that cannot be emptied from the interpretation of this verse.The exposure to the sermon is that it may want it to itself, and it may want it to change it with its simplicity, and between the two states, the separation of the separation is that it is a separation.From the exposure, it was narrated, “The Prophet ﷺ said to Fatimah the daughter of Qais, and she is in her enemy from the divorce of her husband, Amr ibn Hafs, the last of the three of the three You precede me with your soul.Zoud, "this is a saying that there is no engagement in it and the will of the chastity in it is clear.And it was located in Al -Mutta’i: that the ibrim ibn Muhammad said, in his saying, the Almighty, and there is no wing to you, while you presented it from the sermon of the women, to say to the man, and it is the one who says to the man.The death of her husband, you are a generosity and that I am a desire.(P-452) As for you, you are a generous and a relative of the will to marry it, and what is comfortable, if it is not followed by a dates of one of them, then it is a matter I have a righteous man, so it is a house that is clear and his command is a problem.Words are open, and we will leave like it.It is reminded of Muhammad al -Baqir that “the prophet ﷺ was presented to the mother of Salma in her number, from the death of Abu Salamah”, and I do not count what was narrated from him.And in the interpretation of Ibn Arafa: It was said that our sheikh Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Haydara, he would say: If the exposure was from one side, then the one who is so and then the one who is so Glory is like a dramatic honest.The women have noticed a public, but it was special The curtains, with the evidence of the mind, and the divorcees are summarized by the references with the evidence of the measurement and the indication of the consensus, because the return has the rule of the wife, and the ritual of the ritual, The consensus is to prevent the release of the divorced woman in its number, and Ibn Abd al -Salam narrated that the money is permissible to be brought to all of the people, from the death of it The words of Al -Qaribbi, and the question is an induction, because the reactionary divorce has two fragments, and the Shafi’i authorized the exposure in the usual with the end of the death, and it is forbidden, and it is forbidden, and it is forbidden, It was reported by Al -Muwati on the authority of Al -Qasim Bin Muhammad.And you say it, or you are in yourself the concealment.And the extension of the compassion of the depths on the exposure of the denial of the wing, with the appearance that the exposure can only be from the determination in the soul, so the exile of the wing of the wing of the wing of the wing of A warning from the denial of the wing from the exposure, that what is meant is a warning that determination is an issue that cannot be paid, nor is it forbidden for it, so when it was, and it was like that, and it was like that He has a mountain in the human being, for the weakness of the patience on the kings, and God has shown the place of the license that the mercy is on people, with the righteousness of the righteousness The cause of this relaxation: and it is referring to the exile of the embarrassment, so it is the rule of this legislation that was not shown before.And the most late, in the remembrance, to be alerted to it that it is better and the most promising of the enemy of the forbidden, with the alert on that it is a brilliant and its fell, because it is for it, because it is for it.The resignation from the remembrance of the two to the remembrance of the exposure is ongoing on the necessity of the appearance of the word of the words: that the appendix is ​​the increase in the meaning of what is covered by the words, so the words are not.The poisonous for this joke, when he is the same as the appearance of the knowledge that this (P-453) is a violation, it is threw up to a width, as is the case Dahir, and that has increased an explanation of his saying, his punishment: God knows that you will remember them Exposing to you, and he obtained the last remembrance of you, or you are the last one, and it is the best of his saying that God knows that you will be.Surprisingly, and the greatest of those who are exposed to the absence of this kindness, and the pride tried to stir him with what he does not have the same The pride is broken, but it does not reassure it for the same way.So he said it, but they do not promise them a secret that the words indicate, that is, God knows that you will remember them as a sacrifice and an illness; As he does not make a determination to mention what is determined by one of the two ways, and when the remembrance of knowledge was like this, this is a place for the one who is the one who says: It is done So you want: I do not take you because you were if you were taking it, and you knew his action, and I took it as he said: God knows that you were not for you, and you will be forgiven.From you [Al -Baqarah: 187] This is the most appropriate thing for this, this is the one who is a question, and it was said: This is a thunderbolt on the words of deleted: that is, remember them, but they do not And they promoted them, that is, they prepare them and prepare you with the marriage.The secret is originally what was met with the wicked, and it was with it from the proximity of the woman.The life of the neighborhood is that I am proud and that the secret does not improve my ideal and the most promising is that what is meant in this verse is the right to its right, so it will be a secret to the one Extracting, i.E.A secret, ever, that is, do not assemble the doll, and this is exaggerated in avoiding the preacher of the sermon in the number.And he said it only to say a known saying of the absolute effective The saying known is one of the types of (P-454), except that it is not clear, and if the forbidden is a secret, the prohibition is aware of the domestication of the one who is in the authority of this His saying is only that you say a known saying, and the well -known saying is the permission in it, and it is the exposure, so it is a certainty of its saying, and it is not for you.The verse.It was said: What is meant by the secret is here, that is, they are close to them, and it was with him from marriage, that is, the eminent promise with marriage, and it will be a secret of it It will be the discretion, because the saying is not one of the types of marriage, as the marriage is a contract with positive and acceptable, and the saying is a rhetoric: a sacrifice or a sacrifice: It is a naughty, and it is noteworthy that, which does not want to be exhausted on it, then if you say that the preacher of the sermon and the domesticated, and the pornography of the exploitation of you Conflict, for the hundreds of frankness and exposure are one, so if it has been obtained, between the suitor and the usual, the knowledge is that it is wrong with it and that it will be wrap The prohibition and the analysis of the conservation and the methods, if the benefit is one of you said: the intention of the street from this is a mother that the urgent is an offspring to the struggle, so it is a matter For perhaps in this, he will be mistaken for the sacrifice of the desire to the contract of marriage on the usual, by building it; The dibbed of desire is signed in the lust, and the revelation removes the sighs of the neighborhood, for it is from the pamphlet that is the living, the man who is in the man, when it means the intention He desires it, and the neighborhood in the woman is more severe when he faces it with that man, and when he intends His answer to what he is asking for, so the exposing is a method The fragmentation increases what the woman was printed from the neighborhood, and its soul is seized from the good news, but the diligent, so the veil of the neighborhood remains in the way The time is not up to the enemy of the enemy, so this is the permissibility of the exposure to the people, and it is forbidden to open up.And his saying and do not intend to do the contract of marriage, here is the contract of marriage, not designing the belief, and this is the contract of marriage, and it is not upon him.The contract of the marriage is held, taken from the determination in the sense of cutting and deciding.The marriage, and forbids the design, because if it is signed, what is designed to it.“ And on these two districts, the sophistication of marriage is based on the risk of the rejectionist, as they say the bearing of the noon and the stomach, and it was said ( The singer in the eighth chapter.And the book is here in the sense of the written, that is, the presentation of God: it is the number reminded by the definition of the covenant.And the time appointed for some work, and what is meant by it is the period of the time appointed with complete completion, as he indicated to him, then if he reaches their sake: [234].The verse is open in the forbidden from the marriage in the number and in the prohibition of the speech in the number, and in the permissibility of the exposure.As for the marriage, that is, its contract in the number, then if it is signed and it is not a construction in it in the number, then the marriage is a corpse of agreement, but they disagreed with it.Or no: The public is that he does not dispense, and he is the saying of Omar ibn al -Khattab, and the narration of Ibn al -Qasim on the authority of your money in the code, and the son of the son of al -Jallab narrated that it He is dispensed, and the same is not known for the other hand.As for the entry in the enemy, it is in it, and it is an agreement, and it is different in the perspective of its prohibition on it: So Omar ibn al -Khattab, Malik, and the one who is the one, and the one, the one, the one, Hanbul, his prohibition is disturbed by him, and there is no evidence for them on that, except that they were his children at the origin of the transmission by eliminating the corrupt, and he is the origin of the one who said Masoud, Abu Hanifa, Al -Tuari, and Al -Shafi’i: with the annulment of marriage, and the prohibition does not dispense, and it is after the number of the rhetoric, and it was said: And on the husband, its skill is what it was destroyed, and Ruwaidi al -Thaqafi married the aspiration of the Assad, in its promise, So Omar was separated between them, and made her skilled over the house of money, so he informed that on me and said: God will be merciful He returns them to the Sunnah, he was said to him, so what do you say?He said to her, the righteousness of what was broken from it and separated them from them and did not accept them.And the delay is improved from the jurisprudence of the money: for the judge, if he rules the annulment of the marriage of the numbers in the number, not to be exposed in his ruling, for the sake of his ruling.The conflict is not in his mind, so he will be free to leave the arranging on him, so that they may take the saying of those who do not see the exaltation.(P-456) As for the sermon in the number, and the domesticated, the confrontation of the woman is facing it, and the face of the father’s face in his daughter is the birr, and the confrontation of me is not for a while Building falls on the enemy, but then, so Malik said: He separates them with divorce and does not dispense with its prohibition, and he narrated from him a son and a gift: A forbidden, and the marriage after the enemy is correct.* * * Know that God knows what is in your own, so warn Him and know that God is forgiven, a dream, kindness to the previous words of his saying, and no guns of you The women to say it until the book is attained and the speeches are prepared with the knowledge of what I want to cut the obsession They have a secret from every income and trick, and his counterpart was presented in his saying, and know that you are his meeting [Al -Baqarah: 223].And he said and know that God is a sweet, unhappy, that is, so I will take you to what you are destroyed from the violation, it will be forgiven for what you are, and it is forgiven for the forgiveness of it.Halim with you, and this is an indication that the permissibility of the exposure is a summary, as we have provided, and that the sacrifice requires its prohibition, had it not been for God to know the righteousness: For the faces that we have provided, perhaps what is meant from the forgiveness is here to be overlooked, not the forgiveness of sins; Because the exposure is not iniquity, or it is intended by the meaning that is the one who has the forgiveness of sins, and the ripples of hardship, and the insult to the denying.
