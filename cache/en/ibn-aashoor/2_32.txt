The researcher said, “Glory be to you, there is no knowledge of us except what you have taught us that you are the wise knowledgeable.It spoils in it [Al -Baqarah: 30] and open their words with praise and standing in the place of literature and glorification of the absolute bone, and the name of the name of the His saying and we praise your praise [Al -Baqarah: 30] and it is the name of the source of “praise” of the double and not a source because he did not come to the sons of Al -Ruba.A source of miserable praise (P-414) in the sense of its elimination, and it will be like forgiveness, thanks and infidels from forgiveness, thanks and disbelief, and there was a lot of use of the most.Related to the guarantee of his act as the mission of God, and he may come out of that, a brilliant, who said: May God bless you with the pickers, as if they were allocated in the one who has been in the right Tanzhah, they were justified by the measure of his detection, and they became like a gender knowledge like “righteousness and a slave” by breaking the Arabs in the saying of the naps: And they prevented him from showing the scientific and the increase of a thousand and the noun said that Sibuyeh said: We taught us an intended news from the disobedience, not to be almost about their condition, because they are certain that God knows what their words include.Nor that they intended the obligatory, which is that the expert is aware of the news, so it is aware that the news is used in the affiliation.Then, their words indicate that their sciences are unlimited, unanimously, it is a shortage of what God has to do with them, and what he commands them, and he does not command them.The knowledge of its tunnels.And in the export of their words by greeting you, a gesture to apologize for their references by saying their saying, I will make in it whoever spoils in it [Al -Baqarah: 30], so it is the authority About the apology.And the apology, even if they obtain their saying, there is no knowledge of us, except what you taught us, but it is obtained from that from it with the way of the kinna without the openness, and it is the right of the time Their words of hurry, as evidenced by the obligation of the great literature that you are the wise knowledgeable.Because the surrounding is his knowledge of everything the ruler for every creation if it does not make some of its creatures a way to know anything that is not a matter of knowledge of it.Acceptance and preparation; That is, there is no reassurance for us to seek knowledge to what we have not prepared for us according to our innocence.And that indicates that this saying is a marketer for the exhaust and is not a trick, it is its export that it is not possible to reject and not repeat.The sheikh said in the evidence of the miracle: And whoever is “that” If this face comes on this face, that is, the effect of words will be signed, and it will be for the trusteeship that the emotional fulfillment is enriched, for example, and that it is beneficial from the righteousness of the sentence If you see the words with it, it is broken.And he sought a saying by Bashar: (P-415) ؎ Bakhrin before the Hijir ∗∗∗ that success in the innovation and the saying of some of the Arabs: ؎ He sang it and it is for you to be They are ashamed of the remembrance of "" about fulfillment.And if he succeeded the redness, when he asked a miserable, why did he not say: Bakra, so success in the innovation answered him, Bazhar answered him that he brought it with an Arab in the darkness, and if he said, then he said: That is, he answered him with an answer that he referred in it on the one, and the Sheikh Abd al -Qahar referred it to him and said the sheikh in another position: Do you not see that the wise man is from the saying of that The meaning shows in his saying to his companions, and to invoke itself in the matter of innovation, and shows the face of the good from it, uh.The most knowledgeable knowledge is the example of the exaggeration on the correctness, and it is permissible to be a row similar to the ability To become a verb of the attributes, the way we decided in the Most Merciful, and we are in the richness of this cost, as it is not necessary to remain a disagreement that the weight of the actor is a lavish These chapters were created by those who claimed that an actor does not come to the exaggeration.The wise is an act of the rulings if the makers are perished by the fact that he surrounded him from the cell.And the origin of the rule of the ruling in the words of the Arabs to the prohibition of corruption and the hearts, and from it the rule of the bear with the investigation of the neutrality that is placed in the mouth of the horse, and the one who does not do it.So and so, so it was forbidden.For all matters, or in the sense of wisdom, and whatever it has been done with a deer of acumen, other than a three -year action, and that is a listener, he said: The hearing preacher ∗∗∗ He drew me and my companions, and from the gravity of the grammar, what was sought by the father of Ali, and he did not pride him: And the father wanted the mother who was successful with his saying that his father did not succeed, and in the Qur’an the heavens of the heavens and the earth [Al-Baqarah: 117] and the description of (P-416) the wise, and the Arab The derivatives of some, there is no need to cost the first (by making the heavens and the earth [Al -Baqarah: 117]) with the beginning of his heavens and his land, that is, to the “Ala” So the description is a wise man is the heavens and the earth, and it is the arbitrator of creation.Reasonable.Nor to the wise of the wise in the sense of wisdom, because that is not found in paying the search for his coming from three.The knowledge of the wise by following the description is more special than it.Because wisdom is as a blame in the science, it is like their saying a fabric and a clinging poet.And in the arguments of the light for Sheikh, the Lord of God, the Restinist, and in the wise, the rule, which is the knowledge of the shoes and the perception of his work, and it is the creation of the lineage and the one who is the same He has the same arrangement - by opening the B - and seeing the truths of the affairs.And Abu Hamid Al -Ghazali said in the elderly intended: the wise is the rule, and the ruling is a expressive of the knowledge of the best of things, so the best of the knowledge is the knowledge of the knowledge It was previously that it is not known to him, as it is his knowledge other than him, and the majesty of knowledge is the best of the majesty of the knowledge The eternal knowledge that is not perceived by its removal, the preservative of the knowledgeable, is a custody that does not divide it hidden, nor suspicion, and it is not perceived in that.And the words will come to wisdom when it is the Almighty saying that the rule will be given to those who follow [Al -Baqarah: 269].And (you) in that you are the wise knowledge, the guerrilla of a chapter, and its tendency from the form of the shortness, so the meaning is the shortness of knowledge and wisdom on God, the heart of their heart, the heart of their heart They are on the side of knowledge and wisdom when they returned with their saying: (I make in it someone who spoils in it [Al -Baqarah: 30]) or downloading them to the one who is a good The two who are ahead, or it is a true claim that is intended from it, as the mammal of knowledge and wisdom upon him.
