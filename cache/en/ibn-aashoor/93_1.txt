The researcher, the Quran, the sacrifice and the night, if it is necessary for what your Lord has invited you and what he said.The division is to confirm the news in response to the leaders of the partners that the revelation was cut off from the Prophet ﷺ when he saw it, and the night did not take the night to the Qur’an It is an essence on the exposure to it to abuse the laws of the participants, so the affirmation is an illusion of the participants, and the Messenger of God is not repeated Its fall.And the appropriateness of the division by (the sacrifice and the night) that the sacrifice and the emergence of the light of the sun, then it is a gesture to the representation of the revelation of the revelation and the arrival of the ritual, and that (P-395) The Prophet ﷺ in the Qur’an, which is the time when he heard the partners of his readers from their signs of his house or from the mosque.Therefore, the night was tied with a difference (if he wraps).Perhaps the time of the Prophet ﷺ said: (The night, the night is only a few [Al -Muzammil: 2] And the sacrifice was presented by his saying when he said: (And the sun was clear [the sun: 1]).It was written in Al -Muhsaf (and the sacrifice) with a thousand in the image of the ya with the origin of his thousand wow; Because they sponsor the occasion with the most sealed words with a thousand in this surah, then the most vulnerability of the thousand is from the yaa, and because the thousand is in it.The one who tends the thousand from which it does not tend if it is forth with a thousand dusts for the occasion as Ibn Malik said in his sufficient explanation.It is said: The night is a prisoner with an openness and a silence, and a prisoner with two sins and the tightening of the waw, if it is extended and the duration of his darkness is like the one who is a prostration, if it is a prostration, if it is a prostration, if it is a prostration, if it is a prostration, if it is a prostration, if it is a prostration, if it is a prostration of the woman.All of his body, and he is Wiwi and was drawn in the Mushaf with a thousand in the image of the ya of the advanced journey in the book (Al -Duha).And the sentence of (what your Lord has called you), etc., the answer to the division, and the answer to the division if it is a sentence that is exile, and it was not associated with the blame.And Al -Tawdeh: the greeting of those who want to travel.And it is expressed in the verse of the separation after communication That is to God, who is not connected to people with a connection with a vulnerable.This is a denial that God will be cut off from the revelation.It was composed on him (and what he said) to come to the involvement of the two partners, when some of them said: His Lord bid him farewell, and some of them said: His Lord, he wants.And the sentence (and what he said) is a compassion for the sentence of the division and has its ruling.(P-396) Al-Qali (with the opening of the barefish with the lameness of the lam) and the frying (by breaking the endowment with the opening of the lam): the hatred of the hard, and because of the article of the two parties.And it is clear that this surah came down to a second period of time, and it came to the gospel after the deception, which was descended by the wall of the son, and the son of the son of the son of the son Grie “The revelation of the Messenger of God ﷺ fifteen day or the like, so the partners said: Muhammad has bid him farewell to his Lord, and he said.” And the revelation of the Prophet ﷺ two times: the first of them before the descent of the script or the miserable, that is: after we descended from the two chapters of the Qur’an or three of the sins of the Qur’an, or three of the sins of the Qur’an In the first place of the biased and impressive surahs, and that deception is the one who feared the Messenger of God ﷺ that the revelation has been cut off.It is the one who saw it, Jabriel, on a chair between the sky and the earth, as it was presented in the interpretation of Surah Al -Mudhur, and it was said: The time of the one is in the past It was four days and the partners did not feel it; Because it was on the principle of the descent of the one before the hadith between them and before the prophet ﷺ the Qur’an at night.And their second: a latter after we descended from the eight light, that is: the light that came down after the first time This wall will be severe, so that it will be agreed with it with its number in the formation of the lighter.And the difference in the reason for the descent of this surah is indicative of its clarity of the narrators, for whom we think that the garment of the revelation in this time was for the time One day, and that it was only for the companion of the Prophet ﷺ so that its soul would be used and his strength is used The second was the twelve day or the like, so we will go down the surah of the sacrifice is the third descent, and in the third time, the rituals are brought in the rituals of the affairs The matter is frequent by the repetition of some of the three, and this direction is combined between the different news in the causes of the descent of this surah and the reason for the descent.And the act of (frying) was deleted to the (bid you) on him as his saying: (P-397) (and those who are many, and the thorage of God [Al-Ahzab: 35]) is a summary of the sake The deleted and the same is his saying: (fatwas), (Fahdi), (so sing).
