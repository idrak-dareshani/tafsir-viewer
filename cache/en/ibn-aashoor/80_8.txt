The researcher, whoever comes to you, is afraid, and you are afraid, so you are a kind of kindness on a sentence.Advantages are a completion of division.And what is meant: He is the son of the mother (P-109) is a criminal, so they obtained this sentence of this sentence, confirmation of the guarantees of Abbas and he took over [Abs: 1] that the blind came to him.And the pursuit: the intensity of walking, it is for it from the keenness on the meeting, so it is an interview for the condition of those who seek to seek; Because his exploitation is the dispensation of the opponent of his confrontation.And a sentence (while he is afraid) in the position of the situation, and the act of a verb (fears) for his appearance; Because fear is in the tongue of the legs, it is behaved to the fear of God Almighty.The meaning: It came as a request for Zakat; Because God is afraid of negligence in the embrace.And the reaction of the verb that is used for the use of the renewal.And the saying is that you are distracted from him as a saying in that you have been confronted [Abs: 6].And the crossing in these verses is that God Almighty has increased his prophet ﷺ a great knowledge of the prophecy of the prophecy, and raised his knowledge of his knowledge to the highest of what he has reached, He warned him that in the greatest or all of them, the aspects of righteousness and benefit have been hidden from the few strains, and it is not empty of leaving it, and it is not possible for it to be.There is no one with a single way to the mobilizer by taking the entirety of the whole, which is similar to the signs of the sciences, which are in the past in the tester, It speeds up to the hypothesis of the strong on the weak in what is in the row of the righteousness, but the matter of the ethical is the right to be the same as the student, not to the goodness, to the goodness of the good It makes all the mixture one, but the matter is different from the disagreement of the people, and this is a deep inauguration that is shot to it from the roof of the founding base in the chapter in the chapter.The mujtahid, if there is a sign of it (searching for the opponent), and the rule that says: God has a ruling before the guidance, and he has a priority, and he is the same, He has been afflicted, and he has two wages.If that is the position of the diligent people from the people of science; Because he is deducted, his inmates are the one who is the one who is the best of the messengers ﷺ while he did not want him in it, so he urges him from the ruling, or the extent of the extent The diligent, and its excavation on the opposition is the most deep in the way of their ethnicity, so that the master of the Mujahids will not miss the righteousness of the righteousness in it, and if it is not a weakness, if it is not.The strongest liability is invalidated; Because the Messenger ﷺ in the positions of his domestication is based on the place of the revelation, while it was not inspired by it.The right -to -date zakat is the dialogue that revolves around the son of the son of the mother of Mukammum and the case of the entrepreneur from where it is a desolation for the first and the guidance in it, It is the deliberation of the Messenger of God ﷺ to obtain it for the second and the security of its decision to the first to accept it on the one who is afraid of its call, and the symptoms of it, and the symptoms It is divided by faith.In their condition, they are one of the last cases of their secret, one of the secrets of the rule that God has imprisoned, and he is hidden in the usual view of the view, so God blessed him with him.They are, then they appeared in their condition with a warrior to one of them, and he is the one who shared his calling to faith when he did not come to himself to hear the Qur’an.He approached faith, so he enrolled his words to him; Because the guidance of people to faith is the greatest of the sacrifice of the Prophet ﷺ for its sake, for the preoccupation with it is the most important and most likely to be the most important ﷺ.However, there is no other one behind that And if a disbeliever is determined to infidelity, his charity is authorized by his stubbornness, and that the proof is not beneficial in it.God is the case of the believers who are more guided by the guidance and guidance in the case of the infidel who is not deceived by what he showed from the softness or alive from the perseverance, if it is in A general public for the nation with the increase in its number and a special benefit for itself.And in the increase in the believer, one of the means of good and the zakat of the soul is a special benefit for him and the Messenger is a shepherd of the nation and its group, so it is a address to preserving it Where he does not refute the reconciliation of the ones for the sake of the compassion of the group, unless the collection is excused between the public righteous and the private righteousness, in order that the disbeliever is the owner of this His intrusion with the weakness of the hope in his faith, if he prolonged the smoothness in his condition, and with that, the intended is disrupted by it, in general, and the people, and it is a matter (P-111) The owner of the case is a benefit for his own personality, and he does not give up from a zakat with a vagina of the nation with the best of the full of its individuals.In this, a notice of God has obtained his Messenger ﷺ by that the duties are numerous, and he has a high level To precede the thumbs of spontaneity, it is not overlooked by its covenant with proven, northern and richness, and that pledge is a support for the association of the increase in faith.Those are the secrets that do not know their right and their differences except God Almighty.On the Messenger ﷺ and he is the succession of God in his creation, to be crowned with the amount of the deduction, so what God has revealed to him in his matter, follow what is revealed to me and what he did not.He should make his existence as his saying referred to him.Hope: And if we created, we would see them, so you would introduce them to them, and let them know them in the time of the saying [Muhammad: 30].That was the signature of this empty commandment in the template of the wandering of the alarm to the heritage by following these paths and the guidance of the guidance in it on what is on the authority To bring out a navigational plant for the private and public.It is obtained that God Almighty has known His Messenger ﷺ that that is the shame that is present, whose advice is not included in the goodness It is beneficial to the initiative with it, because it is in the case of his defamation on the reception of the Messenger of God ﷺ is more intense than it in other times.This is a pioneering manner on which the prophets are woven, if the revelation does not want him to know that from behind the distress is mysterious, and that the readers have been tired.And in what we have decided, what is known to be known that this is a reference that this verse and its judgment to the prophet ﷺ with the struggle, when it is not inspired by it, and that it is not a sharpness in it, and that it is not acute from it The restriction of Anmala, which is an indication of what was decided in the origins of jurisprudence from the permissibility of the guidance of the Prophet ﷺ and its fall, and that it was made on the base of the righteousness of the righteous.Dahir; Because the wickedness is a mandate to God Almighty, and that his douring ﷺ is not mistaken according to what God has erected from evidence, but (P-112), he may be disbelieved, His Messenger ﷺ on what is in it is contrary to what God wanted in the same matter.And the counterpart of this case is the case of prisoners that spoke after two years from the descent of this verse and the stand in which they are similar.And in his words, the Exalted: And what he realizes is perhaps perhaps he will be zakat [Abs: 3] A matter of forgiveness for him, and the meaning: Perhaps he will be a great zakat, which was the same for it, when it came to time when it came as a guidance.Likewise, his excuse in the urgency is to guide the involvement with his saying: It is not necessary for you not to pay zakat [Abs: 7], as the Prophet ﷺ feared a lord of the faith of the faith With him and accepting the guided believer.If he said: Why did God not know his Messenger ﷺ from the time of the son of the son of the mother of Mukammum with what this is the learning that you mentioned?We said: Because the knowledge that is up to the denial of a negligence, or a notice of concealment, will be established in the soul of the knowledge that is not thirsty.The fact that it is more famous among the Muslims and to obtain the prophet ﷺ is a decoration of both shrines: the place of the guidance, and the place of the benefit.The rule of all of that is that God knows his Messenger ﷺ in this virtue from the guidance so that it is unaware of the same.On his example, and for him to be sought by the scholars of his nation, her rulers, and the rulers of her affairs.And the counterpart of this is what God has set for Moses - peace be upon him - from the proverb in the meeting of the green, and what happened from the one who is among them, and the words of the green for the sake: He has an expert [Al -Kahf: 68] Then his saying to him: That is to be interpreted by what you did not have to be patient with patience [Al -Kahf: 82].He preceded his likeness in the preceding bouquet as his saying in the story of Noah, Noah, that it is not from your family that it is a good deed [Hood: 46] The covenant of the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 124].This is what happened to me in the interpretation of these verses, and in detail, and it is a construction on the basis of (P-113), what preceded it to the interpreters from making them the blame of the ritual On the authority of the son of the mother of Maktoum, and from the worshiper to him, and the one who takes care of him, and from the strong confrontation to call the one who is shared and be overlooked.The appearance of me is that the regrets of the blame that the verse of the verse is given, which was narrated from the Prophet ﷺ his confirmation from the many of what he says to the son of the mother of the mother My Lord for his sake.Because what the Prophet had ﷺ in this juvenile of the guidance of the guidance, does not call a follower; As he only walked the way of the hardships; Because the place in which this juice was evaluated is that Erdhan is not excluded from one of them, one of them is on the other.A believer to the people of Islam, may he be more zakat.And in the case of the believer, it is not fulfilled in faith, and he will not be done in the intention of the intention of emptying to him after when he is increased the increase in his goodness, so it is a goodness, so it is the best of his goodness.The elders of the days.Among the arrests of the validity and witnesses of the living are the sophisticated mind The smallest harm, so the Prophet ﷺ did not ask the property of the domesticated domesticated in it while it was not inspired by it.It is inside the saying of the highness of the nation, so fear God, what you can.With his argument, then he spent him on the part of what I hear, so whoever spent for him the right of his brother, then he does not take him, but he is brought to him.Revive the prestige, and God takes over the secrets.So it is not accepted by the knowledge of the absences, except that God will see him on anything of them, so he does not know that this shared is the guarantee of disbelief and stubbornness, and that God does not know The believer in that is a strain And the east of a heart that does not end it for every time.(P-114) And that is based on the fact that what God has revealed to him to his prophet ﷺ in this surah is a neighborhood for him with a matter that was absent from him when he kissed the ritual The believer.And in the phenomenon of their condition, what is authorized to be authorized to his interior, and what God has appeared in it is the absence of his knowledge except for the shadow of a decay of a believer who is the most generous of faith and the rest of the faith, That is from the reminder of the Prophet ﷺ with what God has done from the good of his literature with the believers and raised their affairs in front of the partners, so the waters of the slave is the one who is the servant The polytheist who fell asleep the proverbs of the son of the mother of Mukammum, so what happened in this blame is the remembrance of the state of the believer and the infidel but it is a integration; Because in the juvenile, there is a dignity of the intended in the name of the believer's home to the intransigence of his heart on a ray that qualifies him because he enlightens it and brings it to it.Careflowers and teaching, at the Sunnah of the Quran in the occasions.
