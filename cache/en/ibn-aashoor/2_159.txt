mosques of God [Al -Baqarah: 114] The verses, so he weed it with Abraham, and the kaabi and the ritual What was issued by the Juda from the denial of the kaaba to his saying, and that a group of them

detail of what he threw them as a wardrobe in his saying, the highest of them, and he said that those who are those who are not This is a way in discourse is the fulfillment of the intended metaphor, its right, the shortening of the restriction and the exact synthesis in the two of it, then the return to what is concerned with the one who is the one Bedouin or symptoms that disturb the intended syntax.The sentence is that those who assure the etc.Its wetness, and the confirmation of the excess of the fulfillment of this news.And the dead and the mortality are the same as the news that it is

of the meaning With the exemption of the argument against the present.The ruling of the past and those who come to the curse of the speech of the rhetoric of their women in that, and what is meant by what we have revealed is what the dedicator was broken from, and the diligent, and the diligent, Antarctic.And the evidence is a group of evidence, which is the argument and the comprehensiveness of that is the origins of the project, which is a sign of many rulings, and the guided evidence is included to the adults and the adjectives The messengers and the covenant took upon them to follow every messenger who came with a honesty, especially the messenger, in the brotherhood of the Arabs, and they are the Arabs who have appeared And it was spread from them, and the guidance is what guidance is, that is, the guidance to the way of goodness, so the verses of the rulings that the people of the people in themselves are included in themselves and their goodness in their community.(P-67) The

hiding the meaning is a hidden one, and the consequence of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of it to the blind to the blindness, that is, they will be assured of all of you, so that they may be from you.And I lost it.And his saying after being attached to the assignment and mentioned this custody of the increase in the expansion of the state of the conquest, and that, that they have fulfilled the evidence and the guidance of the If they did not show what was not shown to them, some of them were excused to say that we have been fulfilled.And the blame in his saying to

for them.And those who have said it is a sign of those who conceal, and the name of the sign was extended between the name that he told it to the alerts that the ruling is that you have come to you after that The adjectives that were mentioned before it, in which these characteristics made them like the viewers of the Sama So he referred to them while he was in the truth, a sign of their descriptions, so for the one who is the best of that, the indication of the alerts benefited that those descriptions are the reason for the ruling, and it is the gesture On the authority of their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 5].And the name of the remote sign is to be a source of the name of the reflection of them and the fools to them or because the name of the sign of this form is the most.In the verse, two gestures were gathered to the face of the arrangement of cursing on the killing, and they are the gesture of the connected to the face of the construction of good, that is, his reason and the reason for the reference to the reference I moved them with that, so I was affirming the gesture to the illusion, standing up to the prescription on the cause.(P-68) The distance from the mercy is with the permission and anger, and its influence appears in the hereafter with the deprivation of paradise and the torment in the hell, and for the one who is the one who is from them.May God protect them from his mercy on the one who is removed, and the reaction of the verb that is harmed by the significance of the renewal with the knowledge that it is not for them, so that it is a good thing for them.It is not a face to specialize in their curse with the future.Likewise, the saying in his saying and cursed them with the cursing of them, and repeated the act of cursing them with the abuse of the letters of kindness from his disturbance to disagree with the meaning The dimension of the mercy, and the curse of the humanity supplication, reflects what happened in God and His angels pray [Al -Ahzab: 56] because the ritual is the ritual of God Good.And the definition in the curses of the ostracism, and it is a customary, that is, the cursing of them all the curses, and what is meant by the people who are disgraced who are the ones who deny the people who are denounced God has exalted and looked at the killing of these, so they cursed them with awareness, and if they do not seek their

covenant of those who have given him the book, he would not be clear to him.Imran: 187].The remembrance of the curse came to waste the covenant of God in Al -Tawarah times, and the most famous of the covenant, which was taken by Moses on the sons of Israel in Houbib Hasr in the authority of the الرّابِعِ والعِشْرِينَ, والعَهْدُ الَّذِي أخَذَهُ عَلَيْهِمْ في مُؤابٍ وهو الَّذِي فِيهِ اللَّعْنَةُ

the covenant of the Lord and divide it, so that the day will not be a departure from the Lord...It will be when he hears the words of this curse He is blessed in his heart...Then, the anger of the Lord will be dissolved and other than that man.The good news is from all the tribes of the families of all the curses of the covenant bound in this project...Let us work with all the words of this project.And in the thirtieth chapter: And when these things come to you, the blessed things and the curse made them their feet.(P-69) And in it: I will witness the heaven and earth to you, I have made

those who have fulfilled what was revealed from the sons and guidance, are also the readers ’readers, then if they read the curse of the curse We himself with their tongues, but those who curse the criminals and those who are unjust, other than those who were descended from the sons and the guidance, so that it is not the same.Thus, the exodus was used from the definition of those who are stuck in a well -being.He knew that the lame of the Arifi Dhiki is a mediator between the mother of the truth and the blame of the fact.Rather, it is fair to the definition with the fact that it is like the denial in its investigation, as if it has become known because the denial is angry, or it is for the purpose Those who cursed them from the prophets who were commanded by the covenant, and that they do not conceal it.And when it was in the link of those who assure a gesture, as we offer it, all of those who do action from the tribe of the rituals of the prayer are not among those who are the

scientist prohibits him to assemble his knowledge of what is guided by people, because the guidance is a rhythm in the misguidance, whether in that knowledge, which has reached it, as the one who has reached it as a good The correctness and the knowledge that obtains from a view, such as the rituals, if it reaches the exaggeration of the dominance The cause is to be transmitted in the people what he is in a delusion that he will be sought, and he is not improved Decorate it and not follow it, so the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Talk to the people with what they understand, they love to deny God and His Messenger.” Put it.(P-70) And in the authenticity of Al-Bukhari that the arguments said to Anas ibn Malik: The shepherd and the tidings, so the prophet ﷺ their hands and their legs, and the name of their eyes, and left them in the freedom, do not be taken away, so they will not be taken until they died, so they died, so they died, so they died Al -Basri, he said: I dispelled that he did not speak to him, and they will stand from his phenomenon, what he agrees with their whims, and they will make him excuse them, as they treat them.Ibn Arafa said in the interpretation: It is not permissible for the scientist to remember the unjust or a privilege that goes from it to the spontaneity as the one who reminds the unjust in what is said.The money is dead, if the authority is weakened, and the Sultan is obliged to what the Muslims are notified to pay the warning to them, so it is not a good thing to be overwhelmed by the people of the people.The disobedience, Ibn Arafa said: The remembrance of this darkness, which causes a fatal harm in people.The authority of Qaribah, Abd al -Rahman, was asked, the son of Muawiyah, who lives, Bin Yahya Al -Laythi, on the day of his breakfast in Ramadan in general Some of his neighborhoods are in it, so he fulfilled it that he fasts for six days and the jurisprudence are present.??And he said: If this door will be opened to him, every day will be slowed up, or fed it, so I bored him on the most difficult, so that he would not return.I said, and it is in his deadness from the infidels that are good, in which I have done a sign of paying the spoiling of the jewelry on the prohibition of fasting.The scientist, if he is appointed with his person, is to inform a knowledge or a basis for a law that must be made by him, like those who have been sent by the Messenger of God ﷺ Their people, and if it is not appointed by his person, it does not leave it either that it is what the nation has known, the nation needed it to know it, especially with it Sitting or a country until he is excused for people who demanded that, or it is difficult for him if he did not teach him to the same as the one who is the same, and this is the same He must be obligated to him, and he is a duty of him, if he is repeated with him in an era or a country, or if he was the perpetrator of the knowledge, then he narrated that he was the one who is the one who is from the son of the son ﷺ He said to him, “People have followers, and that a men who come to you understand or learn, so if they come to you, then give them good.” And if it was shared by it, otherwise it was his responsibility for all those who know that on the sufficiency, or that it is what he knows Among the consequences of the rulings and their benefits that benefit people or a sect of them, but (P-71) must have an eye or a sufficiency on the two guys of the two who are the one who is the one His existence, and from what he has called the need to show him a group of people to teach them to teach them, so that he must teach them what he sees in what he sees in what he sees in what he sees in what he sees in what he sees in what he sees in what he sees.They have a capacity for his understanding and goodness, and for that, the scientist must be upon him if people are sitting for him to learn to meet them from the knowledge of the knowledge of them And his awareness, so it appeared that the killing is a lot of meat, and that the highest is what this verse is included, and the rest of the times are taken by what is in the district, and this is the same The scientist is what is given to him from the questions, then if he has been disciplined with that, or if he has been appointed to the answer, it is like someone who is appointed to the fatwa in some of him Configuration of the liquids and comes in his individualism with knowledge or his help to the answer and in the vastness of his paradise, the preceding vigils in the apparent and the guarantor.And otherwise, it is in the best way to answer or leave.This is the interpretation of the hadith, which was narrated by the people of the Fourth Sunnah, that the Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever was asked about knowledge, then he dismantled him, may God bless him.” His general in the people and the conditions with specializations indicated by the evidence that we have referred to it.Al -Qarbi mentioned that Sahnon was that the hadith was responded to the martyrdom of the witness of the right of his testimony.And the pledge to put the scientist himself in the house that is appropriate for him from this homes, which is mentioned on what he forgets about itself in that and what he is in that And its presentation.And the covenant in the knowledge of the conditions of the students and

attached to them, and it is a realistic, and it is based on the words of the words Etc.It is a condition for the repentance to reconcile what they were spoiled, and it is the purification of what they have seen and to show it to people (P-72), so it is not enough for them to be sufficient for them, or in their cells With Muhammad ﷺ, it is a return from their kings, the testimony of it, which is mentioned in their books, and the release of the repentance of faith after the disbelief, and a lot of disbelief is that it is a lot of disbelief.From his disbelief, but he increased after him and reconciled and explained that the condition of every repentance is to manage you The repentant is what can be managed by what he lost with his act, which he repented.Perhaps the kindness of it and explained the “reconciliation”.And his saying is that you are repenting to them a ritual sentence for others, but rather for a new death, because it is not the same That those who repent from the

the fulfillment of the significance of something increased on the benefit of the discretion, which is that their repentance is punished by God, may God be pleased with them.In the authenticity of Al -Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Masoud, the Messenger of God said, “To God, he will be happy with the repentance of his servant from a man who has descended a house and with him, and he is a good

the verse, a bodies of its estimation: except those who repented, the curse was cut off, and they will repent on them.That is, the satisfaction, and the mediator increased the name of the indication of the significance of the explanation, which is a brief summary.
