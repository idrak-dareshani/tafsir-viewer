it.The scholarship on the question is that the people are raised, they have been mixed with Jews, and they seek their Sunnah in a lot In the fifteenth chapter of the passion of the waves: If you are a woman who has a blood in her flesh, the seven days are in her mission and everyone who touches her You are laid on it, and everyone who touches its bed is washed by his clothes, and he is firmly

the source is in - this section is its effective chapter with the opening of the eye, but it is the one who is the one who is the same.Its mourning is its harms, because it is the one who broken the eye, which is the same as the coming and the evidence, and when the menstruation became a name for the blood of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who

preservatives on the measure of the name of the place, offering what is in his formation in the name Death.What is meant by the question about the menstruation is the question about the proximity of women in the menstruation with the repetition, and the questioners have learned what they asked about and the answer is the same.And the harm: the harm that is not obscene; As the condemnation was indicated in his words, they will not harm you except for the harm [Al -Imran: 111], the appetite of their answer is what the man manufactures with his life that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Let the forbidding from the prohibitions of the woman who is a woman, so that the souls will receive it with insight, and the nation will be prepared for him to project, and to the omission of it, The abuse of what was to be seduced in his affairs and the woman who is tamed in the project of Al -Tawaranah, and you have proven that it was a misfortune and did not show that his face is clear, so that he is in the face of For the menstruating woman, it is a harm to the man, for the woman, and for the child.A precision of which the fetus creates after the urbanization of the menstruation and after that these eggs are mixed with the water of the man, so if it is in the blood, the bit of the man is in the blood in the blood in the blood in the blood.Something of that blood in what is in it, maybe a part of it was confused in (P-366).And a relative because it is a blood that has spoiled and returns any living parts that spoil in the penis as a corruption like the death of alive, so it will be relieved of mourning.As for the harm of the woman, because the reproductive member of it is then the elimination of the resurrection of finding the reproductive power, then if it was disturbed, it was a ladder in the time of its abuse, then it is for it, then it is a pleasure.Weakness, and the child, if the sperm is mixed with the blood of menstruation, the eggs took the eggs before the during the during the time of its saga, to create the wind The Arabs defined him with the experience, Abu Kabir al -Hadili said: ؎ is a prestige of all the dust of menstruation, the

required for it, so they are the ones who conquered the men, but he was not.And the launch of the women on a great addition with a large addition, we are: (O women of the Prophet), and the beginning of an addition with the two centuries as it is here, so what is meant are: About them, which is the group and its saying, and do not bring them closer until they purify themselves.The forbidden came from their closeness It is not a matter of custody of the earticals as it was at the time of the Jews, but it is the numbers of kinship, so it was required for the phenomenon to be a sentence and do not come close to them.Because it is confirmed to the guarantee of a sentence, so they dispersed the women in the menstruation and indicated for the retreat, and both of the two things require the chapter, but it is the one who is in the case The judgment is that the prohibition of kinship is intended by the self, which is given to the legislations, and it is from the intercourse with the kinship with the brokenness of the ritual: Therefore, there is an eye in it, which is the one who is the one who is close to the listener, who is transgressing to the verb; The (P-367) is the intercourse that only comes without a nearby guarantee.They prevailed in the eyes of the eye in it without the approach of the host, separating in the recovery, as they said after if it is afraid of its place and after the meaning They invite no longer.And his saying until they purify an end to disgrace, and do not bring them closer, and the purification is to be guaranteed by the source of the sake of the purity, which is the purity of the dirt, the dirt, and the verb, The righteousness of the purification is the meeting of the self, and it is released in the terminology of the law: on the meaning of the mean, which is the purification of the event, which is appreciated The purity was given with his verb, a jurisprudence, they love to purify them [Repentance: 108] or a metaphor, as they are people who purify themselves [Al -A'raf: 82], and it is said.Ta’a and tightening the distraction, which is a form that purifies the slope of the tuning in the Ta'a.The exaggeration is in the sense of the verb, and therefore the launch of some of it was in the position of some exploration.He read the gathering until they purge the form of the truly deed, and read the Hamza and the Kisa’i and Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim and a successor (Yahnah) Faten.And when it was mentioned that The menstruation is the knowledge that the purification here is the purity of that harm.Like his words in which a man who loves to purify him [Repentance: 108], his interpretation is a successful person in the ways of water The menstruation of the eyelids, and its saying is up to the Almighty, if you purify after that, a second condition indicated that another is purified, and it is the washing of that harm, because it is the harm to the water.On a working purity, and if the second was his saying, then if you purify it with the understanding of the end of the end to build it, then it will come to him, and they will come to him, and they will come (Until it is purified) by tightening the lean and distraction, so the intended purification is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the purity, which is the purification with washing, and it is appointed to this reader that it is from it.It is also necessary, and it is the purity of blood, so that the washing is signed by its satellite with the evidence of his saying before it, so they disgraced the women in the menstruation, and that was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who said: The righteous (until it is purified) with tightening, he said: Because the face is that the two words are with one meaning that is intended for them, and this is the one who is a lot of washing, and this is the one who is a goodness, and this is the one who is a goodness, and this is a good.The two meanings are destroyed, if a first contrast from it has a first contrast to form the second word, useful.(P-368) Al-Tabiri suggested the readings of the tension, saying to the nation’s consensus that he is forbidden for a man to bring his wife closer after the blood of blood

proximity of the man until his wife is until he is a good thing In his saying, if you purify.The verse has indicated that the absence of women in the menstruation is the purification of purification, so if we carry the purification on the meaning of the linguist, then the purity is from blood and the one who does not know His saying, if you purify the legal sense, then it will be obtained from the end and the condition is the thief of purity and the washing, and to this sense, the knowledge of the money is the money And they will be brought up, even if they reach the marriage, then if you forget them, then pay them to them.Rights (until he purifies), he obtained from the concept of ending and from the condition that is confirmed to him, the washing of the washing of water, and it is necessary for the purity of the purity, not in the way, not in the way, not in the we wash.That is, and as for the convergence of the pure of the event, the jurisprudence of Islam has fallen in the fullness of the Shari'a purification here.The verse is upon him, because The legal cleansing is called the removal of the impurity and the lifting of the event, and the rename was described as the two things, and who prevented its husband from its proximity, and it is not the case of the one who is the harm of it With the event, it is obligatory to be a washing that harm, and if the purification is

fullness In Muslim women, then they were not going to wash in the washing that is forgiven for prayer And Ikrama that the purification is a light, such as the ablution of prayer, that is, with the succession of water, and this is anomalous.Abu Hanifa and his friend went to detail, and they said: If the blood is cut off for the countless time, which is ten days at them, it is permissible for them to be a kinship before the absence Especially, and if the blood is cut off to return the woman without the maximum menstruation, it is not correct that her husband approaches her, unless she was seduced or passed on to her, and if he had a prayer, then he will not be a prayer, and if it is a prayer, and if it is a prayer, then it is a prayer, and if it is a time It is permissible for its proxies, but it is lumpy and the ritual of its rituals (P-369) until it is completed by the period A complete decay that is not afraid of its return with the disagreement of his deduction, to less than that, so let him decrease its effect on water or with the time of the prayer, then it is a prayer, then it is a prayer.The verse is a sign of this detail, so Abd al -Hakim al -Sakouti said:

the meeting, and the other is necessary, as it is in the sense of the washing between the one who is in the case of the two of the two readings in the words A special summary, and this is a weak and weak, as the two readings did not intend to the two homes of two vehicles until the opposition is proven.Their divorce is based on their restriction that we carry the purification in the sense of the purity that it is a matter of washing.In the case of these two without other cases, without other cases, then this is only made with a child, then if you said, “Bennah, they will not be able to download the two readings, and the two readers of the two readers.Like us, on the existence of “purifying” and “purified” in two times from this verse, I said: As if he was because the two people in

the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good

from the command of God, “where“ a vague place is based on the annexation of the addition of the addition to a sentence that it determines to be the loudness of its thumbs, and this is the same, and this is the same, On those who repelled the Qur’an and what I see because of its forms, the meaning of the Arabs has become accustomed to expressing your hearts, the way of the kinetah and the absence Their compassion and the accustomed of their expansion.So Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qutdah and Al -Rabi’ah said: That is, except where God commands you that you are disgraced from him from the time of the menstruation of the kiss, who said: By saying the Almighty, what they were created from the earth [Fatir: 40] and his saying if he would like to pray from the day of the Friday [Friday: 9], and on the authority of Ibn Abbas and Abu Razin, Malik, Ben Malik.And Qatada (P-370) that the meaning: from the adjective that God commands you, which is the purification, so that it is metaphorically, or the reason, and the “from” the reasons of the reasons is in the sense of the elderly.And that I see that his saying from where God has commanded you, those who were blessed with him that he was a matter

do not bring them until they will be so Pornography, the matter is the permission, and (from) to the fulfillment of the metaphor, and (where) is used in the illusion of metaphor, and that is, because God commands you that you will come to you With purification.Or what is meant by the command of God is his command, which he has permitted the enjoyment of the women: it is the contract of marriage, and it is a perception (from) to al -Talil and al -Qabbiyyah, and it is the same) Pornography before the forbidden, as if they were arguing about the pornography, or the stones of them, and the integrity of them, and then the permission of them to be blessed with it.He was confused at a place, then his tourist is released, so he comes from him where he wants.And on these two meanings, it is not in the verse that is authorized by the purpose of the definition of the two, that it is in the place God loves the repellents and loves the purified people, and it is an agreement with those who address that that prevention was for their benefit to be the purposeful, and the one who is the one To be identical to the time of repentance at the remembrance of what is indicated In compliance with what God has commanded by them from the abode of women in the menstruation, that is, the repentance is the greatest of purification, that is, the intention of compliance is greater than the sake For you, because the repentance purifies the spirituality and the purification of the body.It is permissible for him to be his saying from the command of God on the right (from) in the appetite and the right (where) for the place and the intention of the place that was the harm.It was said: A sentence is that God loves the repentance and loves the purchases, which are opposed between a sentence.
