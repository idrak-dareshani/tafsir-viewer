The Quranic researcher conservatively on the prayers and the simple prayer, and they will be made to God, who are resigned from the sake to the sake of the sake of the Qur’an, in which there is no obligation for him, the power of the Qur’an, because the Qur’an is obligatory.A tendency arranged by the repentance and the separation of the questions, some of them, but it is a book of remembrance, and a preaching, so it is a group of what we descend from And its legitimacy and its preaching, and its knowledge, in which the thing is collected for the woman, from the necessity The second is the first impotence, or the verse is commanded to attach it to a specific position from one of the Qur’an.As it was presented in the eighth presentation, and that is not made of an occasion in the suffering, or in the harmony of the word of speech, perhaps the verse of the sake of the rituals of the rituals of the rituals Enemies and divorce, for a reason that requires that: from a negligence of the simple prayer, or the sensitivity of hardships in the preservatives on it, so the location of this is the case The opposite between the rulings of divorce and the number, and if you refer to that you do not ask for bonding, then the most prominent is that when many rulings are stipulated in the rulings: They spend [Al -Baqarah: 215], this verse came connected to the misfortune that the precedent verse was mentioned: it is his saying and that you are forgiven and do not seek to the one.Between you [Al -Baqarah: 237], for God called us to the creation of a beam, and it is pardon for the truths, and when that creation was the most difficult of the soul, because of what is in it, from what is in it, from what is in it, from what is in it, And otherwise: the righteousness is from the oppressor, and it was in the nakedness of the soul, and God taught us the Almighty (P-466).Forget the grace among you [Al -Baqarah: 237], the recall that pardon is closer to you, and the enemy is emerging as a friend, and if you are forgiven, then you will be forgiven.About you, if the people disagree with them, unlike if they become, they will not be disputed by the truth.The second medicine is a spiritual one: it is the prayer that God has described in another verse that it forbids the percussion and the denial, so when it was a matter God is on the preservation of it, and you have to say: When the signs of the verses are punished for the signs of the signs of the world, the worldly fortunes are overwhelmed The legislations in the legislation in which the other fortunes are overlooked, so that people do not occupy the bias of one of the two classes from the legislation, on the authority of the one who said: He commanded the preservation of it in the success of the provisions of the children and the outskirts, so that they will not distract them with their concern for them.Some of them said: (When the peoples of the people mentioned, they indicated the preservatives on the right God) and he is in the sentence.With the indication that in the interest in the prayers, the right to the right to God Almighty has fulfilled what he directed to us from his care of our matters that the strength of our regime has come to us, and he said to us You taught you what you did not know [Al -Baqarah: 239], that is, from the regulatory bonus.And on these two definitions, the sentences are kept on the prayers, and it is signed, and its meaning is like a satellite, and the saying of it is the saying of God.Between a sentence, O sons of Israel, remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and fulfilled my covenant [Al -Baqarah: 40].And among the sentences, O sons of Israel And the fullness of a sentence, O you who believe, seek patience and prayer.A sentence, and do not say to those who kill in the path of God, the dead [Al -Baqarah: 154] the verse.(And keep) a form of reactions that were used here for the exaggeration, as it is not.And the preservation of it is the preservation of its duties that it is delayed from it and the preservation is authorized that the attached to it is a great right that fears the deviation in it.(P-467) and what is meant: the arrogant prayers and (the) in the prayers for the covenant, which are the five prayers.Because it is required to preserve it.And the simple prayer is not doubt that it is a prayer from the sentence of the prayers: because the matter of the preservatives is indicated by it that it is from the exhibitors, and it was mentioned in God.Al -Taraif, and it is ahead of the middle, so the Muslims heard and read it, so they knew the intended from it in the life of the Messenger ﷺ, then he dared to do so So they failed, or their concern for them by asking about the tasks of religion in the life of the Messenger about the question about their awareness: because they were determined to the grandfather They lacked it after his death ﷺ they disappeared in that, so it was a severe disagreement: that I have forbidden the sayings in it to a nose and twelve words, with the separation, and for the sake of the time, and for the sake of time, About it; Refer to it to take from that description in the mediator, or from the commandment of the preservatives on it.As for those who are attached to the description of the description of the mediator: it is for those who have tried to make the description of the medium in the sense of the choice and the virtue, so he returned to the way, so he returns to the time of the ritual The prayers are on one another, the same as the Almighty saying: The Qur’an was a witness [Al -Israa: 78] and the hadith of Aisha, “The best of the prayers is when the prayer of God.” And among them is those who tried to make the description of the medium: It is the location between two sides, equal from the number, so he went to the prayer that is between all of the two prayers, And when every one of the five prayers are righteous, because you are considered a signed between two prayers, because the start of the obstacles is an advertisement, so they will see the beginning of the beginning.The day of the day, so he made the principle of the five prayers, the prayer of the morning, so he spent that the mediator: the era, and among them who made the principle the noon, because it is the first of the prayer.As in the hadith of Jabriel in Al -Muwati, he made the mediator: Maghrib.As for those who are reasonable with the way of commanding on the preservatives, they went, and they are asking for the most difficult prayer on people: the abundance of the people of it, so that it is the one who is the one who said: The most difficult of them in the city, they were the people of a job, and the appearance gave them while they were tired of their work, and they may have been in the entry of their work, and he said: When he responded that it is the heaviest prayer on the hypocrites, and some of them said: It is the era because it is time to work and work; And a people said: It is the morning because it is a sleep time in the fast, and I was asking for warmth in the winter.(P-468) And what is correct in this dispute: what came from the side of the effect, and that said: One of them is the morning.This is the saying of the jurisprudence of the city, and it is the saying of Omar, and his son Abdullah and Ali, the son of Abbas, Aisha, and Hafsa, and Jabir, the son of God Al -Shafi’i is also, because the wage is for them that it is the morning, and they know the people about what is narrated from the Messenger of God ﷺ: from a saying, a verb, or two centuries.The second saying: It is the era, and this is the saying of a gathering from the people of the hadith, and it is the saying of Abd Allah ibn Mas'oud, and it was narrated from Ali, and it is the one who is more correct Hurairah, Abu Said Al -Khudari, and was attributed to Aisha, Hafsa, and Al -Hassan, and with him Abu Hanifa said, and Al -Shafi’i in a narration, and he was tired of the son of the money It was narrated, “The Prophet ﷺ said on the day of the beach, when he forgot to pray the era from the severity of the job in the hole of the phenomenon, until the west of the sun - so that the sun - so that the sun - On the authority of the simple prayer, God has buried their graves as a fire.The most correct of these two words is the first of them: for what is in the authority and the two health, that Aisha and Hafsa are the two writers of their companions, to write it.The mediator and the prayer of the era and the people of God, and Aisha supported that to the Messenger of God ﷺ, and it was not dedicated to a thunder Her compassion on the mediator is to appoint her morning, this is on the side of the effect.As for the side of your precedence, the preference for the morning is fixed by the Qur’an.Mashoud [Al -Israa: 78] In the correctness that the nights of the night, and the angels of the day, are gathering with the prayer Dahir, because the time is between the night and the day, the appearance and the era are two nights, the strange and the dinner are two nights, and the morning is the time to be repeated between the two times, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, The treatment of the day of the day: the secrets were prescribed, and its abandonment is the treatment of the exhibitors of the night: he started in it.On the one hand, the commandments of the preservation of it, it is the most beautiful of the prayers with that: because it is the prayer that the stabilizer abounds in it, by choosing the provinces, the assets, the nations, the nations, the nations, the nations, the nations, the nations, the nations, the nations, the rituals, and the righteousness, One of the other prayers on a sect without another, according to the conditions, the regions and the chapters.(P-469) It is one of the people who went to the fact that the simple prayer is the intention of its hidden ones to keep the people to all prayers, and this is a false saying; Because God Almighty introduced her to the pain and described it.How can the group be these two definitions, and it is not understood, and the measurement of that is at the time of Friday The antiquities were valid that they are not appointed.This is the conclusion of what is presented here from the interpretation of the verse.And the words of the Exalted and do it for God, the two things are a matter of resurrection in the prayer with a hostel.He said: It was one of the two laws [Al -Tahrir: 12] and he said that Abraham was a nation that has been granted to God, Hanif, [Al -Nahl: 120], and the supplication was called the special prayer that is called in the prayer of the prayer Maghreb, on the dispute between them, and it is here to be subjected to subjugation and roughness, and in the correctness of Ibn Masoud: “We were greeting on the Messenger of God, and he is the Messenger of God We returned from the Najashi, peace be upon him, and he did not return to us, and he said: In prayer, he will be occupied.I descended and found for God, so we commanded silence." There are no laws here in the sense of the readers of the supplication of the Qunqat, because that supplication is called a gun, hidden from this verse with the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is In the hadith of Anas, “The Prophet called on a height and a mimon in the prayer of the day after a month, and that is the beginning of the channel and what we were cursed.”
