The researcher, the Qur’an, who do not know if God does not speak to us or come to us, a verse, as well They are based on his words, and they said that God took a son [Al -Baqarah: 116] And the Christians in the words and the straying of the straying, except that he said the people of the book in the past verse, which is (and the Jews said [Al -Baqarah: 113]) because they are the ones who started with that Their religion is more likely and the day, and those who have been required to be used until Islam came, so they said like the words of the book of the book.The whole was infected and said that God took a son [Al -Baqarah: 116] except that it was not a group of three in which he is killed by the other, but all of it is an emerging from the dignity And its origin is the misunderstanding in the contract, whether it was taken from a book, as it was presented in the origin of the saying (P-689), the people of the two writers, the mother of God is taken from the mother of God They led them as the Arabs said: The angels are the daughters of God.And the saying of the participants came here because this saying was attached to the entrepreneurs, as it is new in them and fascist between them.When they were seduced by this saying, we attribute them to them, then we look at them who were before them and they are the Jews and the Christians.They said like that to their messengers.If not for here, there is a nursery that will be broken from it, and the retirement of the eagerness of the messenger of the Messenger, as they were used to themselves.Beginning in ignorance is not said by the people of the book, who have proven the message and the need for the messengers.And his saying, or come to us a verse that they wanted to be divorced, then the denying of the nominal and then is an arrogance and the ingratitude of the verses, and it is for you, and it is the same.Dahir from denial, and they have asked the verses that are prestigious and said we will not believe in you until you have been broken from the earth to wrest up the verses and they calculate that the verses are the wonders of the They dreamed that the mental verse is clear of the miracles of its general and its inhabitants, and the Messenger was limited to them with the Qur’an, so they miraculously for them, and they were forced to do so They were fair.And his saying, as well as those before them, said, like their saying, that is, like their article, this is the one who is before them.With those before them, Jews and the Christians, the Jews said to Moses, we will not believe for you until we see God as a mice, and the Christians asked Jesus, who will be able The sky and in this speech is a pseudo of the Prophet ﷺ that what he found from his people is like what the messengers met before him and that was the extension of this The verse is by saying that we sent you the right [Al -Baqarah: 119] the verse.Then it is permissible for a sentence to be the same as those before them, the same as their saying, and the satellite of the answer to the article of those who do not know, and it is the one who does not know.In it, in it, they are in the case of those before them, so that theorizing is that the symptoms are about the answer God spoke to them and their understanding of the people of what is in the coming of the Qur’an is from the greatest verse, and the sentence of “their hearts are similar” And bad view.The sentence of the verses has been among the verses of people who are certain of the symptoms of their answer that they are not the family of the answer, because the people of the answer are the one who is the one who is the one who is the answer.The verses of the Qur’an have shown them what the indications were concluded, and these are not the people of the answer because they are not in the hands of the people.It is permissible for a sentence to be, “Likewise, he said,“ To the last of it, it is interim between a sentence, and he said who do not know and between a sentence that has been among the verses, and the verses are among us, and the verses are among us.On their article and the meaning, the verse has come to you, and it is the verses of the Qur’an, but it does not understand it except those who are certain of any of you, so they will be over and be over.The book was revealed to you upon you [the spider: 51] and the symptoms occurred from the answer of their saying, if God does not speak to us, because he is the heroic, and he said, as he said: To meet us, if not for the angels, we will see our Lord, and they have been arrogant in themselves, and they are a great Atto [Al -Furqan: 21] and the saying in the reference His saying, as is the saying of those who were before them, like their saying, on the part of the saying in the past verse, as well as those who do not know: 113] And their hearts are similar to a report of meaning.Check in the article.The hearts are here in the sense of the minds, as it is compatible in the Arabic language.And his saying, “It is likely“ a form of analogy, and it is the most powerful in it from its letters and close to the likeness, and from the merits of what came in that saying: I run and my regret, as well as in the same way, I will be poured out, and in this verse, the Jews and the Christians have been made are similar to those who are involved in this article, because the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.They are part with God, others, and their claim is not a son of God with more than their claim of the polytheism of idols with God in God The Son is God With these sidelines, the return comes to the state of the people of the two writers, and that is from the redemption of the cushion on the chest.It is brought in the actual act that is in the right of their affliction to the renewal and the recipient as a result of the time of faith as a creation for them, but those who have the same After the appearance of the right, the symptoms are without the crushing of the peat, and the perseverance is about the intended it, as if he did not get the companions of this The defendants.(P-691) And the evidence of the verses is what came from the miraculous Qur’an for the human beings that all of them limited to them, so they did not recover the two likes of it as it is as well A prophet, except for the verses of the verses, the same as the human being, but it was the one who was given a neighborhood that God has revealed to me, so I hope that I will be more than the good The verses are for people from their affairs to be certain and not doubt them They appear to be the jungle and know the truth, not for people like you who are old.
