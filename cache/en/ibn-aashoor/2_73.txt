The researcher, when you kill a soul, you will repent in it, and God is a way that you used to have, so we said, "Say: So, so, so that God will give you the death of God His export, as it is on the expense of the story of the number of blessings and the rolls, and their interviews, with the infidels and the heroes, that this is the time of this.The sacrifice, but it spoke to the heart of the matter with the sacrifice (P-560) to show something of the rule of that matter that they appeared, denounced it, and it is heard, and it is heard, and he said: That is a miraculous purification of Moussa.It was said that what was said in this verse is the first story, and what was presented is the last of it and mentioned to the presentation of a joke that presented the saying in its two years.And when I saw from the books of Jews, it indicates this story, so perhaps what was integrate in the story of the veil that is not the oldest, did not expose it to it A miracle of peace be upon him, and it was not legitimate after it.And his saying, you kill you, indicated that the killing of the Qur’an is the Qur’an in the chain of transmission of the actions of some to the whole, running on the way of the Arabs in the saying of their saying.The jungle said that the children of Han are mentioned.They killed Al -Ta’i in the atmosphere, cuning Abu Jabir, and they drew a mother of Jabir, and that is to repel the Jews.People and Moses came to ask the blood of their cousins ​​with two horses and that the accused denied, so God commanded him to strike the dead with some of that of the cow, and he will be killed.The single soul is from the people because it is the owner of the soul, that is, the soul and the soul, which is taken from breath and in the hadith, there is no soul, and for the sense of the soul in the meaning Launching the soul to God and adding it to God, so it is permissible for his saying to a story about the words of Jesus.The Holy Hadith, “And if I mentioned it in itself, I mentioned it in myself.Taking the word from breath, the soul is the same, the day of the day comes every soul that argues from its soul [Al -Nahl: 111] and the soul is called upon His Excellency did not know what is in my soul [Al -Ma’idah: 116] and the saying of the Arabs: I said in myself, that is, in my thinking without saying my word In the mind of the speaker who expresses it.And you have been disturbed, and you have come to your origin The time of the expression with the sign Communication to facilitate the silence of slurring.And his saying, and God is a clear sentence from the administration of any of you (P-561) The speech here is the same That the creation of the authority goes to the successor as it was clear as it is in what it goes and we will show it if God wills, upon him, when he said, they will be stalled, and they will believe that they believed in: [75] God Almighty revealed the state of my killers.And with a woman and a hearing, not the intention of the killers, the murderer of Moses was dispensed and they managed to be sure of their demand for demands for his blood, so if he did not appear to God, this is not the same Weakened, they would protect her with her Messenger, and that was what increased their doubt in his honesty, and they flipped with two disbelievers, so the emergence of these blood was a dignity of the mother of the soul It is not for you that blood has been lost in the time of our Prophet ﷺ as in the hadith of Huwaisah and the following is the following because of the difference between the two of the two of the two of the two times The nation is in its Messenger, and it is the best of a nation that was brought out to people.And he said that God revives the dowry to a deleted for the briefing, that is, to strike him, and he will tell him, and he told those who killed him; That is, as well as God, God revives the dead, so the suspicion of investigations, even if the suspect is stronger and great, because it is a life from the unprepared of the one who is the same It is possible for the likeness like the saying of the delegate: ؎ If you spend the sleep and you are from them ∗∗∗, then the silence is some blood is deer and its saying is so that God will give God to the one Fires, so he can be appreciated.They see that life until the life of God is likened to it.And he said that you may be reasonable, as they are reasonable, and they did not reach the thought about them, with the fact that all the evidences are all.The usual of our jurisprudence has gone to take this verse on the legitimacy of the words of the murdered: my blood is when it is obligatory for the division and it is necessary This is a separation from the ritual of our before us, and in that, he alerted it to the place of the extension of this verse on the shame of this is that it is a shame that is that it is that it is that it is that From it except the hearing of his saying, and it was referred to that the saying of the murdered was considered to be in the matter of blood.And the mortality has been the same A severe wretched in the story of the sacrifice of the cow that we have provided, we do not indicate the verse that does not indicate (P-562) and the division of the division with the saying of the murderer, but it is the saying of it The murderer is a reason for the reasons for the reins, and when the suspicion of that project is not to kill one of the pretext of the preacher from the obedience, it is that it is that it is something It was mentioned in the possession of money that this is the pharaoh of customs and it does not benefit judgments and the son of Al -Arabi answered that the miracle is in the life of the dead.Likely, but it is not a residence, and the dispute in the judiciary by the bodies is evidence and exile and in the place of the judiciary with it in the books of jurisprudence, and it has been excluded from the purpose of the rituals.
