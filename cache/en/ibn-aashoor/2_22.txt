The Quranic researcher (P-331), who made you the earth with a bed and the sky with a constructive and the sky from the sky, and he brought it out of the fruits of the garment, for you to give it to you that he said: A second -line bed for the Lord, because its argument is the legacy of his saying that created you [Al -Baqarah: 21] and the intended gesture is to be another reason for his sake of his servants, and his slave is for him His worshipers are obligated that he is the creator of all of them all followed by an other side that requires their worshipers and one of them, and it is his blessing from the one The greatness of its ability, for it has enabled them the paths of living and the first of which is the righteous place for the extremist, with a bid of the absence The benefit of their life, which is the food of the life of the life, and that is what I refer to it with its saying and the heavens with a constructive and the cry of that air and the one who is a good one Authenticity in Al -Alawi, from an attire or a murderous, fatal, fatal.He likened it to the way of the likeness, and that people were brought out to the people in which the establishment of their lives is made by the water of the sky with the power of the earth.And what is meant by the sky is here its norm by the Arabs, which appears to the views like the domestic dome, and it is the hatred of the air surrounding the land as it is the same as the one who says it From the sky [Al -Baqarah: 19], and this is the predominant thing if the sky is released by individuals without collection.The meaning of making the earth is a butterfly that it is like a butterfly in the ability to strain and overwhelm it, and it is the most special conditions of the stability.The meaning is that it made it an intermediate between the severity of the smokers, in which the skin of the human being suffers from and between the loose of the woman, where it will be shouted, and it will be made.Great.As for the face of the heavens with construction, it is that the air kick made it a need between the land of the land and between the archaeological hat.It is like building, as it is intended for construction, and it is the righteousness of the righteous, for the air curse has a payment of the harm that appears, the payment of the warning of the waters of the sailor over the sailor, And the payment of the harm to the dungeon, which is driven by some of the makers to us and its kindness until it mixes with the air or the air is repaid to us with what is in the way The dome, and the dome is a house from an adaptive and called (P-332) and the construction in the words of the Arab They said: He built his wife, if he married, because the married woman makes a house in which he lives with his wife, and he has become famous for the sake The domes are built from it It is built with the opening of the mim and its brokenness, and this is like his saying in the surah of the Prophet and made us the sky with an embrace of an embrace.The sky is like the construction of the people of the scientific miracles that you have referred to in the fantastic submission, and that is not perceived by the generations that have come to the time of the time What is the luck of the Muslims and others who have come to the verse and those who came after them [Al -Hashr: 10] in the number of generations, for the sake of the ignorance of the They feel that the sky has the characteristic of building in the end, and the purpose of what they imagined was that the sky resembles the dome of the dome as the Arabs said about the question Al -Nujoom: What is the ignorance of one of the stitches attached to its legs.So the verse leads to the benefit of the lesson with that creative creation; However, there is no luck in it that he said: “To you, so we are allocated to his relationship with the verb”.Under the kindness, or by making it related to his saying: a butter With the attachment.I said: This leads to controlling his saying: You are governing, and there is no evidence for him to be a sign of the face, but to make it to you.It is sufficient for the consequences the creation of the sky, the notification of those who have this verse by the creation of the sky on that adjective, in the establishment of construction from the benefits of the good On the fate of their readers and their understanding, then his followers come in generations.He was omitted “for you” when the sky is a briefing because his remembrance is in his saying, he made the earth to you a shrewd butterfly on it.And (make) if you are in the sense of finding, then you will be pregnant, if you are in this case, and if you are in the sense of a sense, then it is indicated that the land and the heavens are the same As they are.And it appeared in the sense of resignation from a row to a row, and the knowledge of the sciences of the lands of the earth “Jeologia” is given permission for this second direction, so it is in the verse in the verse and the two of them is in the verse of the verse.We did not see, and in the phases that were transmitted in the capacity of God, the Exalted and His ears, so that it will be like his saying, the highest.So we met him [the prophets: 30] to his saying and made the sky a foolish stood while they were exposed to its verses.The people of the people are present, their country, and the first things in the conditions of this life.And in them the benefit of things, which are the air and the water that is followed by the earth, and where the first benefits of the human beings were, and in the disclosure of the earth and the sky with the remembrance of the joke The last, which is the best of what will come from his saying, and the sky is water, etc.And he started with the land because it is the first thing that is dangerous in the mind of the one and then the sky, because it is after he looked at what is between his hands, he looked at what he surrounds.He said it and descended from the sky, so he brought it out of it, etc.This is what you are in the right to find what he preserves from the selection, and it is a successor to what is not the same The nervous and the brain from the religious power of the body of the body of the body with food, and the origin of food is what comes out of the earth, but the land comes out of the plant with the water of the water from the water from the sky And the high classes.He knows that the collar of water descended from the sky is that its formation is in the platforms of the atmosphere from the effects of the steam that is in the atmosphere, because the atmosphere is permanently filled with the elderly The righteousness of the sun is from the water of the seas and the flowers, and from the end of the earth and from the plant, and this is why we find the folded pot with water that is empty after days, if it is left, then it is not possible.The air of the high atmosphere is a cold with its roses, especially in the chapter of winter.With the coldness of the air classes and the virgin, then if the cold increases the clouds, the clouds are seized, a few and the mobilization, then the mockery of the water is gathered in it, and the misery is gathered in it.So it is a rain, which is referred to by the saying of the exalted and the creation of the heavy skyscrapers [Thunder: 12], as well as if the clouds are exposed to the wind coming from the side of the sea, which is the wind, which is the wind of The atmosphere came and became a mantle, and perhaps the clouds were a little, and the wind was brought to him, so one of them joined the other for the other Al -Bahariyah, and in the hadith, “If it was established with freedom, then you will be created, then a thorough eye.” It is a matter that the free and the lack of pressure is in the steam of the steam and its simplicity, the cold and the many pressing, they are hidden by the steam, and the steam is solect, and the sins have been made.With the destiny of the approach of the side of the line of leveling, and it is reduced by the destiny of its distance from it, and to some of this, he indicates what is mentioned in the hadith, “The rain comes down from the shack A name for a sky of the heavens, and the rock is a brightness that is cold, and you have learned that the rain created by the cold, and the clouds are used, so the righteousness is.(P -334) and (from) that in his saying from the fruits is not to be methaid, as it is not a good thing for the denominator of the place Bayan on the clear indication in the words of the Arabs - or an increase in the affirmation of confirmation of the perpetrators of the fruits.* * * Do not make God And you know the fulfillment of the formation of this sentence on the precedent words, and it is repeated on the worship of worship, and “no” is forbidden, and the verb is rewarded The verb is based on the answer of the matter from his saying, worship your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 21] and what is meant here is his own causes, and he is his argument for a sign that he is obligated to It is eligible for the individuals with it, so it is more special than the divorce against worship; Because against worshipers, the slave of worship.But when the righteousness of the servants was in worship, it is similar to the blessing of worshipers, it was made to leave the trace of equal to the worship The most of their partners.And peer by breaking the equal and similar noun in an order of glory or war, and some of the people of the language increased that it would be a hostility, that is, as if they were seen from the enemy.And there is no comprehension for the palace of his being a rich name, and I think that the face of the connotation of peer on the opposite and the opposite is that it is from the parallel of similarity, with the same He has to compete with his similarity and crowd him in his goal, so the antagonist will get.And its counterpart in its opposite is the same as a Qur'an, because the Qur'an is the one who rushes and is fresh.And when no one does not confront for the hatred of those who are on the authority of his fear, nor whoever is without him to inform him, the hatred was a compliance of the same, and that is the same For the courageous fighting.It is said that he made a peer for him, if he is equal to him.The meaning: Do not prove to God, make it make it make it not cloudy; And he called it a dump of exposing them, because the state of the Arabs in their worshipers has the same as those who settle between God and between it, even if the people of the ignorant people say: And they say: We do not worship them except to bring us closer to God, and they made God the creator of the gods, and they said in the metaphor: I have no partner for you except for you, but it is for you, and it is for you, and it is not for you They worshiped her, and they forgot about her worship, and to her to her and the vows for her and the residence of obsessions around her servants God Almighty is that the lesson is action, not by saying.In that, there is a sense of being overwhelmed with them and throwing them with the obligation of the situation and the contradiction of the sayings of the verbs.And you say it, and you know a state of current, and the act of you know that the verb was not intended So, then the verb is the home of the obligatory, and the meaning: You are aware of knowledge.What is meant by the knowledge is the complete mind, and it is the righteous opinion that is in the way of the ignorance of the one who says the Almighty, say: Is it not the one who does not know.[Al -Zumar: 9] And his case has made the situation of the end and the negation Surprisingly in the words of the collection between the storms and the excitement of the body, it has proven to them the knowledge and the goodness of the opinion to influence their concern and wrapped in the way Haddanism, and they are forbidden to take the gods or exile that with their dressing with it and made it not gathered with the science with the goodness of them for what they are of what they are.The peace of their directors.This is a great, great.If his thoughts worsened in his soul, his determination will be fired and his talents are gone, and he comes with what is indicated by the exhibits in it, so that he can ask the kins.Alla and Al -Balmam.And his saying, and you knew that they know that God does not deny him, but they are worse and forgotten, and they said: ؎ except for you.
