They were married to them before, so they deserved to return to them.And say it if they are among them with a condition for the end; Because the guardian, if he knows that the synonyms are among the two husbands, and he saw that the bull will return to income and corruption, then he may prevent his followers, and we advise them to this The forbidden: It is that the guardian is not entitled to prevent her, with the consensus of the two husbands with the disadvantages of the pensions, as it is not the one who sees its money from it, at the end of the saying of the He was satisfied with the two privileges and did not accept the judge.In the verse, a sign of the mandate adopting the woman in marriage, based on the majority of the conditions.Because the side of the woman is a weak side, which is covered in it, it is informed of the delicacy, so it does not fit its leaving it like this matter with its soul; Because it contradicts its breaths and its weakness, it may be hidden by its right rights, cursing their benefits as it weakens the opposition.And the direction of the sign: that God referred to two rights: the right of the guardian to forbid the muscle; If he was not in his hand, he would not have forbidden him, and it is not said: He forbade the seizure of what is not a right to him; Because if it was like that, it was forbidden for the prostitute and the aggression sufficient, and he came with a formula (what is for you) and its part and the right of the woman to be satisfied and for the sake of the sake The women, and he did not say: to marry them, their marriage, and this is the money of your money, the Shafi’i, and the gambling of the jurisprudence of Islam, and the distance of the father of Hanifa in the one who is the one who is in the way The marriage, and the plaster invokes it that God supported the marriage here for the women, which is Return away from the uses of the Arabs in their saying: the woman was married, because in the sense of married (P-428) without detailing this, this is a detail of this.Because there is no disagreement that the consent of the woman with the husband is the one called the marriage, but the dispute is in the prestige of the guardian of that without a barrier, and this does not contradict it.The lies of albums, so it is not from the abundance of this verse; Because it is a response in the days of the days, and there is no force on the agreement of scholars.And his saying that is preached by a sign of the ruling of the forbidden from the muscle, and the individuals of the kaf with the name of the sign with the fact that the addressee is a group, sponsoring the one who is in the first place.In it in the sense of the dimension of the one who is indicated to it only, its individuality in the names of the sign is the original, and as for its collection in its saying, it is more zakat for you, so you will find it.And the meaning of a zakat and the purification is that it is a loyalty to the exposure, and it is close to the good, so it is a sign of growth and mulch, and so they were to merely, and they were happy with them.To join what is in the difficulty of the Hatita, so God knows them that the muscle is a loyalty to the symptom; Because it has an endeavor to follow the parents among the families who were approached with the vulnerability and proportions; If the muscle is a lip of the day, then the permission of them is a dream, pardon, and honestness of the condition, and that is beneficial from the abyss of the guest.As for his saying, it is purified, it is the meaning of his enormity, that is, he cut off the causes of hostility, tunes, and hatred with the difference of the muscular, which you intended to cut off, and what is the one who cut Specials are at a few time that followed the satisfaction of what is harmful to the remaining tunes, the inherent hostilities, and the burning hearts.And you have to make a zakat in the first sense, looking at the loudness of the world, and purifies in the sense of peace from the sins in the hereafter, so that it will be the best The precedence of the marriage with his saying is zakat.And his saying, and God knows that you do not know that it is not possible, and a removal for their expansion when you receive this judgment, because of their disagreement, and what they are of their repercussions And goodness and righteousness on their symptoms, so God taught them that what he commanded them and forbade them from him is the truth, because God knows the beneficiary, and they do not know, but they are known.A deleted, that is, and God knows what is in it like the tamas of your zakat and your purity;
