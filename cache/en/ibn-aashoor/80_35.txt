The Quranic researcher, if the goodness comes on the day of the woman who escapes from his brother, his mother, his father, and his companions, and his sons for every one of them, then he will enrich him, A laughing laughing, and the faces of the day, so that it is a dust, which is a murder of those who are the disbelief.The fulfillment of the separation on the day and the goodness in its words, the Almighty: The human being was killed by what he disbelieves [Abs: 17] and what he followed from the recipient of the two parties from the one who said: [Abs: 18] To his saying: We poured water in a morning [Abs: 25], so he was removed from that warning on the day of the part of the part, with the occasion of the occurrence of this warning, the punishment of His saying: (to his food) and his saying: He has enjoyed you and that you are ours [Abs: 32] on the part of what was presented in his saying: If the crime comes from Al -Kabir: [34] And the good: a severe shouting of the human beings that smear the reputation, that is: it is stigmatized, it is said: a texture that scratches a minor and transcendent, and its freshness is scratched in the eyes of its eyes.The people of the language have been disagreed in its detection, and it is not serious, and what we mentioned is the conclusion of the saying of the caliph, and the ritual, and it is the most good and the one who was in the name of the name of the verb.The Qur’an is a flag of prevailing on the height of the day of resurrection and the end of this world, and the savings of it will get the voices that remove the earth and the collision of some of the clashes.And the blow of the pictures that are sent to people.And (if) is a disagreement while he is attached to (the hero came) and his answer is his saying: The faces of the day are traveling verses.And the coming is used in the acquisition, the likeness of the day of the part of the penalty with a person who came from another place.On the day the woman escapes from his brother as a result if the loud comes as a suitable way.Al -Fararar: Harubs to save from frightening.And the ritual (from) here is permissible to be in the sense of the explanation, which is prepared by the verb of the righteous to the causes of the fools when it is said: a flesh from the lion, and a flesh of the enemy, It will be in the sense of equality like (about).And if the people are close to a person who escapes from them, it requires this day to this day if he sees what is permissible from the torment of the people who are close to him, that he will be lost Likewise, when he knew that it was similar to them, as they committed it from the work, so it was mentioned here items from the kinship, because the kinship is a shower that will be in the ritual And kept on the peace of her owner and his honor.The thousand spoke in the soul is a cooking on the comparison and comparison, and both of these two grandparents will repel its owner from the separation, so what you think of you The two grandparents do not leave them a field in the soul?!The categories of the kinship were arranged in the verse according to the righteousness from the classroom to whom it is stronger than it, which is in the way of which this day.So he calmed the brother of the severity of his contact with his brother from the time of the boy, and he will arise with that one between them, the length of life is dominated, then the brother is seen to the brother For their son, and the mother was presented in the remembrance, because the thousand of her son was strengthened by his father and the pad on the faction, and he was transferred to the wife and the sons, and they are the people of the people, and the people are the family Distinguish with him and a mandate.(P-136) And it was softened by the number of these relatives without being said: The day the woman escapes from its closeness, for example; To be brought up with the image of the horror in the same way.And each of these kinship, if you appreciated it, was the mouse who was mentioned with him, but he said: (And his companions) to appear that it is with it, and the woman is from it, It was mentioned as the companion indicating the proximity and the mandate without the description of the husband; Because the woman may be other than the good of the twenty, for her husband, so it will not be his ribs from her as a severity The closest is that this is the right of the believer from his partners, who are afraid that they will take their followers when they stayed on the infidels.And the relationship of the relative with the verb (spoiling the woman) requires that they have fallen into a torment that they fear that they are afraid of those who communicate with them.He gathered in his saying: One day the woman escapes from his brother to the end of him, he informed what is beneficial to that day, where he does not leave him, from his mind The same as the hide of the cloud is insulted as it disperses it for its affliction on the mountain of its owner, and they are lending to the forehead, and it is the best of it Great.And a sentence for each of them is a day that sings it as a result of the premature adherence to the increase in the Zawil day, and they are not.And where the righteous of the fifth of the five relatives required that every relative from those of those like it, the ritual was universal to the whole of the whole, so that the one said to the whole.A person from them is a thing that he sings, that is, about the preoccupation with it other than the male, but the preoccupation of those who are without those from the kinship and the companion.And the two: the important situation.And the news is presented in its saying: (for every person) on the beginning to come to deny (a matter) indicate the greatness; Because the Arabs do not start with the denial in its sentence, except with the justifications of the justifications that the grammarians have prepared in a period of ten bumps, and among them is the one who is able to do so.(P-137) and singing: make others rich, meaning: it is not needed for something in his abundance.The origin of the singing and richness: the argument of the beneficial to Him, the Almighty said: What I have enriched from you from God from something [Yusuf: 67] and he said: What is the richest of my money [Al -Haqa: 28].Here I have been used in the sense of work and preoccupation.The enrichment, which is a benefit in the sense of work, is used to work The sending of the messengers or the slogan is a gesture that the believers turn them out of their partners, the involved, the excess of the ritual, and the raising of the trades as it is the same as it is the same as it is.The faces of the day are traveling to the last of the surah.And the sentence of the faces of the day, a traveler (if), that is: if the hero came, the people are two lines: a lining, and their faces are traveling, and their faces.Here the remembrance of the people of the people of the righteous are presented to the faces of the people of hell, the dispute of his saying in the surah of disputes (but whoever is overwhelmed [Al -Naazat: 37]) and then the saying of: His Lord [Al -Naidat: 40] to the last; Because this surah was evaluated on the baptism of the intensity of a man from a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a great man who is a great person who is a great person who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones Investigating the words, and the believer was the luck of it as a result, and that is in his saying: He does not know you, perhaps he will be blessed [Abbas: 3] Whoever takes advantage of you, you have to confront [Abs: 5].As for the surah of the disputes, it was built on the threat of denials of the resurrection, as a result of his saying: The day the leg of the legs will follow, the one who follows the ritual Dragon [Al -Naza’at: 6], so the context was for the supplies and the return, and the etc.Usually the Qur’an is a punishment for intimidation.And the first and second (faces) of the vigilance, and that is the notary of their fall aside.And the return of (the day) to confirm the link between the condition and its answer, and the length of the chapter between them and the ability: the faces of the one who travels to the day of the day.The return of (the day) was enriched by the answer to the answer.And the travel is the same travel, and the travel: the light and the light, it is said: the travel of the morning, if the sun appears in the horizon of the dawn, that is: it is a joyful face.(P-138) and (laughing), meaning: a seminar.And (preaching) with joy, and the cinema and the time in it for the exaggeration is like: he was answered, and it is said: Bush, that is: joy and secret, he said: He said: Oh, oh And the bond of laughter and the prevalence to the faces is a mental metaphor; Because the faces are the place of the appearance of the laughter and the prevailing, it is from the chain of transmission of the verb to its place, and for you to make the faces as a serenity of the souls as the one who said: [Rahman: 27].This is the faces of the people of Heaven, who are reassured and present.And the dust - with two conquests - all dust, and what is meant here is that it is an insult to the dust and the impact of the cabinets.And (her exhaustion) is overwhelmed by it.And the abundance: with two similarities of smoke, the face of the face is lost from distress and grief; As well as the rich, which is not the dust, as the verse requires it, lest it be from Return, which is the disagreement of the original and there is no need for it.And he settled between them, Al -Jawhari, and the son of Mansour and the owner of the dictionary.This is the faces of the people of the infidels, this is known from the context of this diversion, and it was stated that he said: These are the disbelief in the absence The terrible for the two.He came in the name of the indication of the increase in the clarification, in the case of the case that caused them that.The chapter is here to benefit the piety.It was followed by the description of the (infidelity) with the description of (the dawn) with the description of the infidels is greater than the description of the immorality, because of the meaning of the immorality of the work of the work, so it is mentioned.The corruption of the belief and the corruption of the work.And the remembrance of and the description of (the dawn) is an emotion that benefits that they gathered between the disbelief and the immorality.‌ * * * (p-139) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of Takwair, and it was not proven from the Prophet ﷺ that it was called a pleasant name.In the hadith of Al -Tarmahi on the authority of Ibn Omar, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: Whoever is pleased to look at the Day of Resurrection as if he saw my eyes, so let him read ( And (if the sky breaks down [breakfast: 1]), and (if the sky is created [the split: 1]).This is not openly in the name; Because the day of the Day of Resurrection is in all of this surah, but it is in the first verses of it, so he appoints that the meaning: let these verses be read, and I mean in the validity Al -Tarmahi Surah, if the sun is shown [Al -Takwir: 1], and it also cursed the Tabari.And the most whims are called (Surah Al -Takwir), as well as its name in the Qur’an, and it is a shortening of the domain of which was given [Al -Takwir: 1].And called (Surah Kuwar) called a story that was brought up in it.And it did not count it in perfection with the light that has more than a name.It is an angel with agreement.It is the numbers of the seven in the meter of the coming of the Qur’an, and it came down after the surah of Fatah and before the surah of the highest.I am nine and ten.* * * I was composed of the achievement of the penalty.(P-140) And to prove the resurrection and start as the horrors that they advance and moved to the description of the horrors that falls on it.And he intended to be the Qur’an, which they lied to; Because he promised them a resurrection of the investigation of research; As they threw the prophet ﷺ with the Sunnah and the Qur’an that a Satan brings it to him.
