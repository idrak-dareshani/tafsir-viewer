The researcher of the Qur’an, I have been in religion, has been shown to be guided by the absence, so whoever disbelieves in the tyrant and believes in God, he has forgotten the righteousness of the righteousness.The exhaustion of the arrival of the matter of fighting in the path of God in his saying: And fight in the path of God and know that God is a knowledgeable hearing [Al -Baqarah: 244], as he seems to be.The entry of the enemy in Islam, and he showed in this verse that it is not dedicated to the entry into Islam, and the words will come on that it is a judgment or a bond.And the punishment of the verse of Al -Karsi with his verse on the occasion that what the preceding verse was seen from the evidence of the Haddan and the greatness of the Creator and the one who has been excited about it.The nations from his matter to market the hearts to the acceptance of this religion, the clear, and the righteous, by choosing them without a barrier, and it is not forced, and from it Performing them on the part of the question: What are they left to him, or they are distorting Islam, so the sentence was a bayyan navigational.And I will be able to do the verb of his custodians, for the prodigy is in it to make, that is, make it with freedoms, and that is only by the frivolity of the people of what is more severe To me.Religion is presented with his saying: The king of the Day of Religion [Al -Fatihah: 4] and he is here that the law is intended.And the definition in (religion) for the covenant, that is: the religion of Islam.(P-26) The denial of his dedication is a news in the meaning of the end, and the intended is the reasons for the reasons for the ruling of Islam, meaning: Do not be distressed by one of the followers of Islam, and the arrogance The intention of the general is a text, and it is a clear indication of the heights of his deeds on the religion of the birds of its types, because the matter of faith runs on the recipient, and the place of the mind In the chest of Islam, the partners of the partners in Islam, and in the hadith, “I was commanded to fight people until they say that there is no god but God, then if they said it, they will be deaf to them.” It is not permissible for this verse that this verse has come down before the ritualization of all of it, so it is clear that this verse was descended after the time of it The descent of the surahs can be used as two years, as we presented it in the chest of the interpretation of the Fateh Surah, not, and it was said that the last verse was descended in To mislead [Women: 176] the verse, and the ruling of the fighting over the acceptance of the disbelievers became the Islam and indicated the conviction of them for the income under the authority of Islam, which is the authority of Islam.And the work of the Prophet clarified it ﷺ and that was concluded with the country of the Arabs from the polytheism after the opening of the Mecca and after the people entered the debt in the debt when it came when it came to the time The conquest, when God wanted to save the Arabs from the evil and the return to them The mourning of Abraham, and from the elimination of the kaaba from the partnerships of the participants, and from the end of a great sect to the bearer of this religion and the mother of his etc.It is dominated without his followers from the oldest, and God has fulfilled the peace of the Arabs from the evil as it was signed in the speech All of it was all that God has gone on to the religion and the fight against the power of His authority, for that he said [Surah Al -Tawibah 29]: Fight those who do not believe They do not prohibit what God and His Messenger prohibited and do not condemn the religion of the truth from those who have given the book until they are given the reward from a hand while they are a junior [Tawbah: 29] For what was presented from the verses of the fighting, such as his saying, O Prophet, the ignorance of the infidels and the hypocrites and the most expensive of them [Repentance: 73].On the authority of the verses before them or after them three types: one of them is the verses that were ordered to fight the defense as the saying of the Almighty: and they fought all the partners as all of them are all.] And his saying: The month of the forbidden month is the forbidden and the forbidden, so whoever is accustomed to you, be accustomed to him with the same as what you have been accustomed On Islam, it is to pay the enlargement of the participants.The second type: verses that commanded the partners ’seizures and the infidels and did not be seen in an absence, so it is permissible for them to be released with a verse of a verse: so that they are not.It is opposed by our verse, this is not dedicated to religion.The third type: What is absent is like an attribute of the Almighty: and fight them until it is not a temptation, and the religion is for God [Al -Baqarah: 193], so he will be aware that it is a good man.Aya: until they are given the reward [Repentance: 29], as the hadith was copied, “I was commanded to fight people”, this is what appears to us in the sense of the verse, and God knows.And for the people of knowledge before us in it: The first said Ibn Masoud and Silman ibn Moses: It is a breeze with his saying: Oh, the Prophet is the ignorance of the disbelievers and the disbelievers [73] The prophet ﷺ was the Arabs of Islam and killed them, and he did not accept them except with it.Perhaps they are given from copying the meaning of specialization.And the recipient of its copying with the rest of the Prophet ﷺ Arabs on Islam, he opposes it that peace be upon him, he took the reward from all infidels, so the gathering of the gathering is.The second saying: It is a judge, but it is in particular.The people of the two people are forced to Islam, and to this money of the Shafi’i, he said: The reward is only taken from the people of the book and the Mujwam.Permanent from A snake that carries the verse on it, meaning with the meeting of a sect in which it is achieved.Ibn Abbas and Said bin Jabir and Mujahid said: This verse was revealed in the supporters, who were in the ignorance, if you were the woman from them - that is: he does not live for a son To redeem it, when Islam came and became Muslim, it was a lot of the children of the supporters, and they said: We do not leave our children, but we will be denied them in Islam, so God is revealed.(P-28) Al-Saddi said: It was descended in the story of a man from the supporters.Al -Nasraniyah, we were victorious and brought out with them, so their father came to the forefathers ﷺ and he asked to send those who rejected them, so they will be sent off, so they did not.With the fight, then we copied that with the verses of the fighting, and it was said: What is meant by the negation of the denial is the negation of its influence in the Islam of the one who has given his hat Exalted: And do not say to those who will give you peace, you are not a believer, you seek the presentation of the worldly life [Women: 94], and this saying is an interpretation in the sense of the righteousness of the brother The matter.It was said: What is meant by the religion is the neutrality and a debt that has a smooth book, and the denial of its deeds is forbidden, and the meaning does not deny the Sabaya from the people of the book because they are the people of the book.From them and the companies.And his saying: Rashid has been shown from the absence of the fall of the satellite of the cause for his saying: I do not deny it in religion, and for that the sentence was separated.And (rationalization) is a compassion, and a conquest of conquest, guidance and payment of opinion, and it is met by absence and fooling, and the absence: the misguidance, and the origin of the source, (Guy), the wow turned, then they were touched, and the (clear) of the meaning: it is distinguished.So, Adi (from), but it is clear that the call of Islam and its appearance in an independent country after the migration.And his saying: Whoever disbelieves in the tyrant and believes in God, he has forgotten the righteousness The clarification is only the disbelief in the tyrant, and it is in it the two people in religion, as it has been separated from the distinction of rationalization from the absence of the appearance that the follower of Islam is the same It is a choice to him.The two tyrants and idols, and Muslims call the tyrant idols, and in the hadith “they were humiliated for the tyrant’s manganese” and they gathered the tyrants, and I did not.The pods of the Qur’an, which is derived from the tyrant, which is the rituals and the rituals in the oldest, and it is reprehensible and its compassionate, and the tyrants of a tyrant on the verdict of tyrants - from the way - (P -29) Like an angel, dreadfulness, and mercy, so he fell in it a place of power - between his eyes and his lords - So he turned to a folded, so that the heart of the mother has come to a thousand, and it became a tyrant, and then the meaning of the source was removed from it, and it became a name for the sect of this.Like an ancient in that it is the name of a sect in which the meaning of the source is, there is no compassion and dahd And the origin of a shore of the source, and it is called the one, the gathering, the remembrance, and the feminine as the source.He was kind and believed to God on the condition because we reject the worship of idols, in which there is no way in which he did not compensate them with the worship of God Almighty.And the meaning of (I seek you) is your touch, for the Sun and the Ta’a to confirm as saying: So, you are forgiven by the one who was revealed to you [Al -Zukhruf: 43] Al -Nabaha: So they would be broken.As there is no meaning to seek to seek to hold the ritual period after faith, but faith is the same as itself The thing is from it, so the condolence is a naked and for the goodness, and the nakedness may be in a rope that its tariff is tightened to some of it, and it will be complicated, and it will be held in it.So he said in the scouts: The bustling vein is from the documentary rope.And (Al -Wahqi) the arbitrator of the tension, and no separation for it, that is: I do not decide, and the separation is the cutting of the separation of communication without fragmentation with the disagreement of the severity And fragmentation.And holding the bustling of the ethnicity, the likeness of the believer in his steadfastness on faith in the bicker of those who touch you with the righteousness of the righteous A fool in the cell of the sea, which is a reasonable gift that is likened to a sense of good On the interpretation of the Surah of Lamman, when he said: The state of the deceased was represented in the case of those who wanted to be infer A safe person whose obedience is divided, so the meaning is that the believer has fixed the two sins of the heart of the heart in the world, and it is a survivor of the eloquence of the fall in the hereafter, as is the case A deadly rope that does not separate.(P-30) The verse indicated that this is a plus for the believer that you benefit in its world by being on the right and insight, and that is what you ask for, and that is what you ask for, The hereafter with his saying: God is a knowledgeable, which is an abundance of promise and reward.
