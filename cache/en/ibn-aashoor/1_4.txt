The researcher of the Wasim, the day of religion, followed the three descriptions of this, this is not for the repetition of the attributes of his attributes, the exalted The Almighty was described as the Lord of the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful The alert that it is exalted in the universes and the phases, the mercy of the one who is considered the one, and it was from the sentence of that (P-174).With the legislation, which is due to the memorization of the interests of the people in general and in particular, and the greatest of these legislations was divided into the cost of the cost of the call of the passion, which is the one who is in the authority of the whim For him, he is forced to be for him and a hardship, so that those descriptions are presented in the opening of the book, which are relieved of the costs of the disobedience to what they are in disobedience For their sake of pardoning them, and for them to be disorganized by their abandonment, and that they will have the amplitude, so they will be entrusted with what they knew from the suspicion and the mercy of the On the authority of Al -Talif, for that was the requirement of the shrine to be punished by the remembrance of the rule that the judgment is on the day of the penalty on the day of the day, every soul is rewarded for what is the same for the sake The compliance and the cultivation of the memorization of the world's reconciliation, and that is surrounded by the promise and the back, and the validity of that is made on the Day of Resurrection.Therefore, there is a choice here, and a king or your money added to the Day of Religion.As for a king, he is a muezzin of the residence of justice and the boundary of the parking in it because the king is to manage the righteousness of the parish and to melt from them, and for that, the people have resided.And if the Lord of the Day of Religion was said to be in it, in which he was reassured for the spoils, they find from the affairs of the Lord, mercy and forgiveness He agreed with his entirety with the rewarding acts of it.If you say: If the procedure of the preceding descriptions is authorized that all of the honesty of God Almighty has mercy on us, then this is sufficient for that in the urging of the name, and it is not the same A mercy in it, so it is not a crime to coordinate to the project with his choice.I said: Those who address the meat of them who are not guided by the understanding of that, except after the punishment of those descriptions of this description, and for those who are guided by the understanding of you, and for you to understand that He has mercy on him, as well as he may have the mercy of the naughty on the competing mercy, even if it is useful for him, and perhaps the mercy of the mercy of the mercy Rather, he gets a weak luck from it, and he influenced the mercy of his own luck on his mercy.Perhaps it was interpreted that the mercy in the clogging of God is the highest of a dignitary matter, not a repetitive, and that its description is the Almighty with the same as the lineage Because of the legitimacy of formation, livelihood, and life, and he may have thought that the mercy in the fate has raised the urgent that it is permitted.Perhaps all of what the crocodiles are compassionate from the reconciliation of the reconciliation with a murder, but it was his possession of his lust and his hardship.All these are an indicative of symptoms of the legitimate clogged, and for their proverbs came the punishment of the past attributes with this adjective, reminding of the sake Calculating, lest the intended to be established from the legislation when the understanding of all the priority is subjected.(P-175) Then, in the punishment of the saying of the Lord of the two worlds [Al-Fatihah: 2] The Most Merciful [Al-Fatihah: 3] by saying the king of the Day of Religion, indicating that he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the day Then you are tired.And his saying, “The king of the king, who was read by the one after a thousand after the Mim, and the reader of Asim and Al -Kisa’i, and Jacob, and the successor of your money in the thousand, so the first is the same as the one who has a righteousness.In the compliance of the Mim and the second, an act is an act of an king if it is described as the king with the broken mim, and both of them are derived from the king, so the origin of the property in the language will return to the way to the dignity of the As Ibn Attiyah said it, then this is with the truth and the metaphor, the verification and the convergence, and the readings of “the king” without a thousand, which indicates the deity Because the king is the opening of the mim and the breaking of the mother is the king of the light and the king is more special than the king, as the king is to ensure the Mim is the publication in the struggles and the rituals of the The matters of the minds and the policy of their enormousness, their individuals, and their citizens, so that the king of people is said, and the king of the animals is not said or the domain, and the king is not the same And its benefits without it.And the jams read “the king of the king” by opening the mim and breaking the mother without a thousand, and this reader was narrated from the Prophet ﷺ and his two companions Abi Bakr and Omar in the book.Ibn Attiyah said that Abu Ali narrated about some readers that the first of those who read (the king of the Day of Religion) Marwan ibn al -Hakam, and the father of Bakr al -Bakr al -Sarraj al -Sarraj This is invalidated, so he may say that, he wanted that he is the first to read in a special country.As for the readings of “Malik” with a scourge after the mim in the name of the act of the actor, it is the reader of Asim, Al -Kisa’i, Jacob and Khawaf, and it was narrated from Uthaman, Ali and Ali, and the son And Mu’az bin Jabal, Jalah and Al -Zubayr, and Al -Tarmahi narrated it in his book that she read the Prophet ﷺ and his friend also.And they were fixed, as it is the same as the readings, as it was presented in the sixth submission.And those who are protected and protected by the readings of the readers of each of the readers of the “king of“ a thousand and a thousand and the readers of “Malik” in the thousands of specials in the opinion The concept of the word king And the concept of the word of your money, and they disappeared from adding the word to the Day of Religion, and the word is added to the Day of Religion, so it is equal in the statement that it is the one who is the one who is in the interest Smoothing likeness.There is no confusion about the expansion of the king or money to the day of the day of the day of the Day of Religion.On the authority of the "Malik" is a language in the "king of" in the doors, a prince, a shoulder and a friend: the king.(P-176) The Day of Religion on the Day of Resurrection, and the principle of the last house, for the religion is in the sense of the penalty.The rest of the enemy remains ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗

complement to conducting the attributes of the greatness of the bone and the mammals on his name, so that it is after that The true divine, as they excelled what they were forbidden by their gods from their saying, God, the children of so -and -so.So they said this is your God, and God is Moses [Taha: 88] and said, “Moses, make us a god as they have the gods [Al -A'raf: 138] and it was some of the doors of the Arabs, especially the god The poet said: A ritual was brought up to her later and in the hadith of Aisha in Al -Muwati.The hadeeth.And the description of God is the Almighty, as the Lord of the worlds, all of them, then he followed the descriptions of the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.Religion is a description of what is the greatest of what he accepted because it is reported from the general public in the days on the day of the penalty that is the first days There is nothing about entering the entry under his king Like the king of Malik, Shahehan Shah, the king of time, and the king of the world, Shah, hen and what is marred by that.With what is in the knowledge of that day by adding it to the debt, that is, the penalty is from the integration of the alerts on the ruling of God, because it is an infringement of the religion of the debt, that is, the reward of the debt, that is, the reward for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the religion His rewarding works are equivalent to it in good and evil, and that special justice said: The Almighty said every soul is rewarded for what you have earned, not the injustice He described him as the king of the day of justice and described him with the honor of the king, so the mourners are inserted With the advent of their virtues in the establishment of justice, and the Arabs have known for that.The
