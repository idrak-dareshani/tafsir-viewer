not hidden, so if it is not hidden, so if it is, then it is that it is that it is, so if it is, then it is that it is, so if it is, then it is that it is that it is, so if it is, then it is that it

of the jurisprudence of Islam is to provide for the number of death in the dead nation, its husband is for the muscles Fiqh, so we look at the rulings of the number of death, and to the ruling of the purpose of the tenderness for the tenderness, so we will be in the authority of the tenderness A legitimate, so we see the basis of the righteousness and the division that the number of death is

the bearer from the death was put in place, and if it was the same as the same The sorrow is equal in the number, so it is aware that the rule of the number of death is the achievement of the pregnancy or its numbers, so let us move the view to the nation, we find in it, and we will find it.If we have the way to the way to graduate the regrets, and we found the description that is due to the exhaust of the more than the one who is ruling, the lineage is the description of the human being; As the bearer is not different from its condition by disturbing the items of the women, and their

put their bears, and it is the saying of Omar and his son and my father, peace Her lamb and her husband put on his beds, and she was not buried for the Zawaj and their pilgrimage: (P-444) The hadith of the sequence of Islam On the authority of the year of the pilgrimage, it is a pregnant woman, and she was laid down after a month as a month, as in the Mawlid, or after four nights, then a night, then you will be a night And he said to her: “You have resolved, so I would like to seek you.” They are their best to put their pregnancy [Divorce: 4] and the generals of the loads, with the delay of

the Surah Al -Qasari will be revealed - meaning Surah, O Prophet, if you divorce The longitudinal, that is, the cows, and the meter is not the surah of the longitudinal women.And when the pilgrimage

the same.Sing about his others, and Ibn Masoud said: Do you make it overburdened and do not make the license on it, he wants that it is not for a long time And Ibn Masoud that the number of pregnant women in the death of the two maximums, and his choice of Sahnon from the money, so he said some of the two boys: that in this saying, there is a gathering, and he said: Some of them: In this saying,

which they are required, as it is, as it is in It is expressed in Al -Hawatat: which is that the two verses are in general, special and void, so we intended us to the image of the opposition, and we have done in it once, and this is the same Singing for one of the two places in every place in the most likely, so it is a risk, but there is no collection, but (P-445) is the hadeeth of the sacrifice in this To survive, as you start the surah of divorce by saying the exalted, if you divorced women, calling for the specialization of the general saying of his saying and the signs of the lusts, for the sake of their sake, 4] Here is the divorced obstacles, and it was said: Ibn Abbas returned to the saying of the crowd, and he is the appearance of the hadith of the one who is in his disagreement and my father, peace be upon you.May God be pleased with her, so I told them with the hadith of a chain, if you said: How do you not fulfill the project, on this, to what is in the past of the women?And how do you stay after the cultivation of the fullness of the whole time, the period of what appears in the state of the woman?And how to solve the holders of the couples If her pregnancy was

with the lawful intention: It is the preservation of the lineage, so if his right is spent, then the women have been given to the people to do in themselves, so he said, from what he said.A wing of you, so that if you want the woman after the enemy, the same will be fulfilled, so that it is done.As for the couples, it is not the entry of them, for them, the number of death, without the number of divorce, for the generality of this verse, and because they have the inheritance, so it is the most important It is considered, until it was a legacy, and the income of the husband, it is not denied that the husband has been hidden, as it is permissible for him, so it is permissible for him Until the preservation of the proportions, and that is your money, and if we look at it in a field, then the dead was measured by its husband, who did not enter it, who did not enter it, Before he touched her, who God Almighty said in it, O you who believe, if you marry the believers, then you divorced them before you touched them, then they are not for you, so they are for you [Parties: 49].And they mentioned the hadith of the richness of the daughter of the chapter of the cheerful.(P-446) And he did not expose it to her, and he did not enter it that it has the same as the truthfulness of its women, and the number of the inheritance has to it, and the inheritance is not violated.The same as the skill of the example of it.And he said it, if they reach their sake, that is, if the period is ended in the table, that is, if it reaches its teeth, that time, and made it to be more The wonderful release in their saying of the term, and the origin of the name of the domain, which is the prayer, is a release to entrust the period, similar to the time to the righteousness.The term is a period of time, it has been made for the rhythm of action in its end or in its virginity.And their renovation of their wages for their rituals, and their most promises, and the sake of the sake of the addition was known to their guarantee without other than the addition of the purity The best of them is the judgment of what they have, so do not show them the leadership of it.The idiots were supported by them, and the sake was added to them, alerting it to the fact that this is the sake of this time for them and the meaning of the wing here: the embarrassment, to remove what is not possible for you People are from the exhaustion of the woman to marry after the number of death, and before the day, for the people of the dead to the dead may be embarrassed.And the embarrassment, and he said, "So he did in themselves, they are overwhelmed by those who embarrassed the verb of others, as if he said if you were the woman with a hidden one The dead, then it was a reason for the increase in its speaking from itself, then if it is not that preacher, then what is the embarrassment of what you do in its soul, then the soul of it, That it is forbidden for the woman to do what is not from the well -known and usual, such as excessive grief, or the darkening, or the darkening Her husband, and thickening to those who deny the women, they will speed them up after the number, or after putting the pregnant woman, as you did the same.The concept of the condition has indicated in his saying, then if they are in their absence, they are, in the period of time And adornment, as for the promotion of the number, the Muslims agreed to prevent it, and the separation of the saying will come in it with the saying of it It is from the sermon of the women [Al -Baqarah: 235].As for what is meant, the difference is the presentation in two things: in addition, and in the house of the house.As for the darkening, it is the source of the woman, if it is sad, and the clothes of the sorrow were wore, and you left (P-447) Zain, and it is said that it is said, and it is intended in it.Zain, goodness, and pigmentation of clothes, except the white, and the left of the righteous, and it is obligatory for the Sunnah in the correctness.On the authority of three, only four months and twenty years, "and this is not violated in this except the Basriya goodness, so he made the darkening three days, not others, and it is weak.And the ruling on the plural of the plural of the arms of all that is whispered to the men: from the vision of the beneficiaries of the usual woman, until they are prepared from the desire for the ritual, and it is not for you The scholars differed in the degradation of the divorce, so Malik, the Shafi’i, the Rabiah, and a giving: there is no addition to the divorce, take the openness of the hadith, and that the divorced woman is divorced, and the divorced woman And it is between it and between what it is possible for you to lend in it, with the disagreement of the deceased from it as we presented it, and Abu Hanifa, and al -Tori, and the son of the son of the son, said: Sirin: The divorced divorce is like the vote.On the authority of it, because they are all in a number in which the proportions are preserved, and the war of the writer is like a Muslim in that, when your money is forced, and it is forced, and it is forced, and he said: Thoir, to the union of the heart, and Abu Hanifa, and the lust, and Ibn Nafaa, and Ibn Kananah, said from the money: there is no more than it is more than it, and it is not the same.By God, and the last day, "He described it with faith, and he is a light -held holder, because the description is not the source The project has been stressed the Prophet ﷺ in the matter of pluralism.They disagreed with them, and the Messenger of God ﷺ said: No, no two or three times, but it is four months and ten months, and I was in the ignorance of the ignorance of the world.The Prophet ﷺ has permitted a mother of peace in the period of her murder on my father, peace: to make patience in her eyes (P-448) with the night, and wipe it with the night, A severe woman who was a woman who dispersed her eyes to be subjected to the dissolution of the night, and wiping it with the night, and it was narrated that all of it is in the mother, and he said: The religion of God is pleased: and for that, they will end the prophet ﷺ the
