The Quranic researcher (P-192) is the path of those who have been blessed with an exile or a kindness of the two straight path The path of those who have been established by the two, for the two of the two: the first: that the intended from the request is a result, it is the way of the Mahdi to it, and the way to the sake of the sake of the sake, As for her, the way of those who have been blessed with them.The second one is what is in the way of creativity from the complexion in detail, so that the meaning of the path can be able Like this supplication, then it will be for him from the most likely to be the same as the meantic affirmation, and also for what is in this way from the report of the truth of this and the right of this Their souls, so that its concept will obtain two times, so it will obtain it from the benefit of what is obtained by the righteous confirmation and the advertisement of the evidence is not a good.Fear for one of them, on the other hand, the one who tries to be different between them, as the verification of me is that the compassion of the biar is a name for the noms of the al -Badil, and it is the one who is al -Badil, which is the one who is the one who is the same One of the grammarians on a separation between them and no witnesses who appoint fate to one of them without the other.He said in the scouts: If you say what is a good thing?I said: I am sure of the confirmation of what it has in the inhabitants and the disturbance, so I understand his words that the excess of dispensation is a matter that refers to the confirmation, and it is what is in it, and it is what is in it The renovation of the memorization of the substance and the memorial of the principle of it and the meaning of the repentance of what the al -Badil benefit from the grammar The work of the worker is as if it was said: We guided the straight path, the path of those who are the ones, and its name is a confusion because it is a return to the memorial with his eyes, with the return It is a return to him with what he limits with what he believed, so this is expressed by the freshness and the trinity, and it is intended that the example of this is the way, which is the one who is in it.The extension of al -Badil and the extension of the righteous confirmation, and you have learned that the collection between the two things does not come to the face of an adept at the absence of this.And the return of the name in al -Badal or al -Bayan to build on what is meant to be attached to the first name, the most important of the words of the word to be notified of the re -re -repetition of the re - Creativity and that it is a love for the soul, and the same is the reaction of the verb as his saying, and if they pass through the language, they pass a dignity [Al -Furqan: 72] and his saying: We have seduced them as we have seen [Al -Qasas: 63].The pioneer and the glow are what you do not find to attach it to the first act (P-193) without a return, and the return is not in its example for the deception of the confirmation of the confirmation, for the deception of the affirmation, because it is the same Hang it.Ibn Jinni said in the explanation of the problem of Hammasah at the saying of al -Ahwas: ؎ If it goes away, it will go away from a deceased, who will be afraid of his sovereignty, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say, if I say: I fall asleep because it is not in the second other than what is in the first, but it is permissible to say that if it goes away, it will go away, when it is connected to the second verb from the ritual of the neighbor, and the benefit of the The saying of God Almighty, those who have seduced us, as we have seen us as we have seen [Al -Qasas: 63].I said: And I did not make it clear that the abuse of my father is Ali, so perhaps he was forbidden from the adoption of our seduction, instead of our seduction and made him nurtured, even if the money is one.And in the abstaining of the blessing of them with the way of the communication, and the chain of transmission of the action of them to the guarantor of the majesty, it intends it with the disagreement of them To them and those who are lost.Then, in the choice and description of the righteous path that it is the path of those who have been blessed with them without the rest of his description You gave so and so was that it was active to generosity, as the Sheikh decided by the grandfather, God sanctified his secret in his saying ﷺ as you prayed on the premature of the sake, so he said: The righteous, the path that you have guided to the servants of your blessings with what is in that of the exposure to demand that they be the right to be in the past of the guidance of the first of them.With the righteousness of them in taking the reasons that they have seen to those trades.Performed from the conditions of the angry and those who are overwhelmed, so they will be optimistic and comfortable.The grace is fracture and the conquest is derived from the grace, and it is the rest of the livestock and the dignity of the human being and the delegation, and the verb is listening, victory and crushing.The good and the goodness because the building of the verb with the fraction of the bodies and the attachment of the good deeds, then the inspiration was used in the pleasure of the one who is the same and the exalted Its owner did not feel it.What is meant by the grace in its saying that you have been blessed with the grace that is not similar to what it supports it, and its punishment is not, so it is a good, so it is a good The bad and the other goods, which are the most important, so the domestic blessed blessings include the guardian of them, the Zabi, the spirituality and the corpse, and the abundance of the day.(P-194) The grace is in this sense that its greatest refers to the guidance, so the guidance to the losers is from the world The other one is a backwardness in the truth of the guidance, and because the height is in the world, even if it is obtained without the earnings, but the guidance is attached to the goodness of it.For it.It is intended for those who are blessed with those who have the full blessings.And do not hide the perfection of the occasion between them and among the Mahdi at that time, so that it will be in the way of the path of those who are the righteous paths, and it is the one Naqaa, and that the blessing upon them with the full ritual has been guided to the straight path.And those who have been blessed with them are the choice of the nations preceded by the messengers and the prophets who have the full blessing.Rather, the one who is the one who is the one who is blessed with them while he went on, and his being is the religion of Islam, which came after the argument that the path of the righteous is a neighbor who is the one The truth is in the origins of religion and the branch of guidance and piety, so they asked a strong religion that will be in his straightness as the grace of the blessing, so they will be answered, and they will be answered, and they will be answered, The last of the past, and increased it.Or what is meant by the Prophet, the prophets and the messengers, so they were in the case of more than what was for them, and for that, and God has described many of the two messengers, and the two messengers said, Jacob to his children, so you will not die except when you are Muslims [Al -Baqarah: 132] So God Almighty accompanies the nations, so he did not reach the end of the people You qualify them to see this with that, but it is the one who is the messengers with the fullness of the cases, and it is intended to be exalted from the creation in the end, and let us represent that The drunkenness of it is permissible, but it is forbidden by sugar or not forbidden in the first place that the prophets did not have a few of the drunkenness, which is the fate that is the guidance of God All of them are, so we are pleased with them with the prophets, or with the best of their followers, or with the Muslim Muslims It is based on every time on what suits the way of guidance that preceded its time and which was not attained to its end.And the saying in the one who is required from (our guidance) on these quantities all of them, such as saying, as it is presented from the extent of our guidance to the request of crops, or the increase.The supplication is based on the number of people who are in the righteousness of the ritual, so that all of them are the blessings of God, all of them are many of them Yes, the pain of thought is burst in the poor punishment, and the torment of the last is followed.The exhibits between some scholars in the fact that the infidel is a blessing on which there is no exaltation under it, so it is not extensive in the development of the dignitaries of the two.* * * (P-195) is not angry with them Those who are lost, the word “other” is a tenth of the tenth readers, and it is a description for those you have been blessed.Or an extension of it, the description, and the seedlings are both in the intended, but it was presented in the scouts with the face of the pedestrian aspect of the words of the words, to lead to the words of the description, It is on the way to the validity of the knowledge of the knowledge of the word (otherwise) that is not recognized, otherwise it is to make “other than the angry“ a lobe ”for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.Sibuyeh, while the father of Hayyan said about him, and he directed him that the al -Badil with the description is weak, as the matter is that al -Badil is the eye of the virginity of it, that is, the name of it is the same, the same name is that it is the same.The most prolonged meaning of the other is not the precedent, and it is a sheet of the limits of the terms of the territories until the owner of the scouts needed to take over the one who is the same From anger, and I do not think that my time wanted to be interpreted, but he wanted the meaning of the meaning.Rather, it was correct (other) as a description of the knowledge with their saying: (other) to be tempted in the dignity, the addition is not beneficial to it, so that it is not in the same way.The distinction is not described by the knowledge that the adjective is required to be more famous than the descriptions, so (otherwise), and if it is added to the knowledge, it is not that it is not.The dignity has been with it, with the plot of knowledge, as everything is added to it is other than, so what is the description of the saying in your saying that I passed by.So the consolidation is either by adopting as a place (those who have been blessed with them) is not intended for a certainty, so he was the adultery The name is the scholars of the suffering in the mind of the elderly, so it was in the sense like the denial, and if it was memorized, it was not the same as the knowledge, so it is a matter of the same The angry that is in the image of the known for its addition to a knowledge, and it is in the sense as the denial of the unique will (Other), if he wants it to be a negative against the description, that is, the equivalent of his elaboration, it has become a definition, because the thing is recognized by the negligence against it, against it.When the one who was blessed with it was not punished, the punishment was the angry against it, so Ibn Hicham said about Ibn al -Sarraj and al -Sayrafi, which is the one who chooses it His Excellency said that he is not the first of the relics [Women: 95] and he was transmitted from Sibuyeh that (otherwise), but she did not know that it is in the sense of the seductive, so it is the same as the name of the one who is the same He said that she was recognized if it is intended with its proven addition.And as if the money of the two people is one, because (it is not), if it is added (P-196) to the opposite of its Sufis, and it is one against one, that is, to the equivalent of its essence, it is not.A steadfast adjective for him is not transmitted, as it is not the thing that we will ever be stable, so he said: You have to be the one who is the one who is the same Omma and his saying (other than those who are angry with them) from the first type.And from the abuse and descriptions of (those who have been blessed with them) that they are not angry with them, nor the lost people who were invalid By the time of their time with the call of the messengers to the truth, then they imitated it, then the misunderstanding of them was disturbed by them, so they changed it, and they did not take care of it, and the right of it, Like them in the poverty of grace, bad compliance, and corruption of statement, and the abuse of worldly lusts on the establishment of religion until the right of them to the right of God Careful from the state of those who were guided to a straight path, so what they have been cursed with their care to preserve the path in it with a straight The adjective of knowledge with the blessing, and their guidance turned into a delusion, and the most promising that they did not have the right to God's anger before Islam, because they have gone out of them May God be old, and to Jews from the sentence of the first team, and the Christians are from the sentence of the second parties as he is known from the view of Tarika, the appearance of the two years.And the first dispersal of the two descriptions is required in the Jews and the second in the Christians, so in the nations, they are in the nations, and this is the face in the interpretation, which is the one who is upright with him The straightforward, and if the intention was the debt of the Huda’iya and the religion of Nazranism, the supplication would have been obtained for the scoring, for Islam came to them.The angry and the dreadful ones are included in the separation of disbelief, the debauchery, and the disobedience, so the angry against them is an angel for the separation that is baptized and the one who has been blessed with that A baptism or from a very far reflection, and those who are gone for the difference that made the debt wrong with misunderstanding and a few listening; And both of the two parties are defamed because we are commanded to follow the path of the truth and the way of the effort to his injury, and the Jews are from the first and the Christians from the second.And what was mentioned in the effect of what the appearance of the interpretation of the angry against them in the Jews and the righteous of the Christians, is a sign that in the verse is a matter of being lost in this way Wasfan; Because each of them became a science, while I want to be broken in it.It was clear to you from this that the compassion or the lost person is unlikely to be angry with them, a promise to seek refuge from the evil of the poor of the punishment, because the dedication is from the one who is the same The anger of God does not dispense with the misfortune of the misguidance, which was not informed of his companions of those parties, and that is the face of the angry of the angry, and the one who is overlooked, nor is the one who is over.Because the supplication was by the question of the negation, then the exhaustion in which it is obtained (P-197) with the weakness of the weakening after the exile of the strongest, with the sponsorship of the communication.And the anger that is attached to the angry about them is the anger of God, and the right to anger known to people is that it is an exposure to the soul that follows it.So you ask for righteousness, as the entity is due to the demand for revenge and the demand for revenge is due to the fact that the residence is established.And who appears to me that the will of the righteousness is not from the boundaries of what the anger is in terms of it does not relieve it of it, but it may be from its effects, and that the anger is from the anger of the The fact that what is incomplete is to be arranged, and the deeds of the act of angry from it and the freedom of its actor, and the symptoms of the angry and the anger of it are obligatory By cutting charity and harm, and that may lead to the request of fee from it, so the limit that is emerging at the anger in the soul is different from the extent of the ritual of the rituals And the disagreement of customs in its reasons.Perhaps those who made the will of the righteousness to be angry with anger, sons on the Arab laws.And if the truth of the anger would be reflected in the fairness of God, the Almighty and its chain of transmission to it on the truth of the cabinet evidence that indicates that it is forbidden And the symmetry, it was obligatory for the believer to the anger of the anger to God from its true one, and the way of the people of science and the view in this way of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake It is necessary, or to the sequence of the memorization, for the necessity of its meaning, which is a characteristic of God in the sense of anger is his necessity, I mean the punishment and insult to the day of the penalty Religion and salvation in the world or is from the tribe of the representative.The predecessor was in the first century and the second century, they were held from the interpretation of this similar to what they have seen in that imitation of the prayer of the prayer It is the intention of the legitimate from the people, so when the view arose in science and the demand for the knowledge of the entitles of things, and the people say that people in the suffering of religion in what is not permitted the truth, the right of the truth, the right of the truth, It is the most correct methods of interpretation to the understanding of the Muslim and the one who is the only one, so the religion of religion with their industry on its barriers.The conciliator is distinguished from his core and his slander.And all, while they made this guidance.After the Bayan, it is never back.And what they interpreted only with what is known in the tongue of the Arabs is concept of his family.The anger of God, the Almighty, will be overwhelmed by the one who is the one who is treated for his disobedient guidance for his affluations, and he arranges for him to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And those who escaped the eminence in the (P-198) lower of the fire, and without the anger of freedoms, he was mentioned in the hadith And he hates you, and he said, and he has a lot of question.Thank you for your pleasure for you [Al -Zumar: 7], and if your Lord wills what they did [Al -Anam: 112], and if your Lord would not, he would not believe in all of them all over all of them [Yunus: 99].And know that the anger at the rule of the ethical is a principle of the group of the three of the three of the original, which expresses all of it, which is: the ruling, the ruling, the ruling, the ruling, the wise The principle of the courage, but the anger is expressed by a premature principle for a many, developed and dominant ethics, so they will be nicknamed in the man The seventy is the love of dominance, and its support is to pay what it harms, and it has a number of accustomed and the limit Either by the leadership, it is the oppression and the intensity of the anger of a little, the arrogance, the wonder, the chairs, the hatred, the envy, and the harsh, or the decrease, the decrease, the abbreviation, the coffin, the abundance, the abundance, the absence, If the anger is released, a language was given to some of the anger, and therefore it was from the wise of the word of the Prophet ﷺ “a man said to him, he said: I just said: Do not get angry.And some of the millions of the Persians were asked: What is your king?He said: Because we are punished for the destiny of sins, not over anger.The anger of the forbidden from it is the anger of the soul because it is the oppressor and the aggression, and from the anger is a burden, and it is anger for the impermissibility of the public and the general, the public, the public, the public, the public and the general, The prophet was not angry with itself, so if it was destroyed by the sanctity of God, he was angry with God.And his saying ((nor the lost)) is given to the angry against them as he is a disadvantage, Ibn Attiyah said: Maki ibn Abi Taleb said: If there is no entry The one who is lost to those who have been blessed with them, and it is a distance from it, so it is true that (no) is increasing to affirm the negation that benefits from the one who is not.The one who is given in the matter of negation is the same as his saying that you say what came to us from the evil and no vow [Al -Ma’idah: 19] and it is a prayer in the words of the Arabs.And the master said in my scouts, so that it is not deluded that the exile is the group, so it is permissible to prove that one of them was, and when it was not in the meaning of the negation, the nose is in the rest of the It is on it, and it is not the increase in (no) here as its increase in the same way that it prevented you from not prostrating when I commanded you [Al -A'raf: 12] as it is deluded with some of the two beneficiaries; Because (P-199) is that of the leadership is angry and meaningful, because the meaning on the evidence that is here is an increase in the calculation and the meaning of the negation.And the delusion is the way of the way that is intended to be a mistake.Thus, the way requires or does not know, and it is a lost camel, and it is the opposite of the guidance and the release of the lost on the mistake in the religion or the knowledge of it.And the delusion in the tongue of the law is the interview of the deduction and the appetite is the full faith and the misguidance without that.We have been pleased with the guidance when it is presented that it is a sign of kindness.What is meant by those who are angry with them and those who are grateful are the separation of disbelief, so the angry against them is an angel for the difference that is baptized and that is the one who has been disgraced A very distant interpretation of which the dominance of passion is carried, so they are blessed from the path, which has been written by your question, and it is not straightforward, so they will be fulfilled, so they would be fulfilled, so they would be fulfilled.An excuse, as he did not make them wrong, except for the fortunes of the world.And the righteous is an angel of the difference who have perceived the right of the right to a pillar and a misunderstanding, and both of the two parties are punished, because the creation is a matter And the extinguishing of the effort to his injury.And beware of violating his intentions.And when the remembrance of the angry was presented to them and the knowledge that the anger was upon them because they were sharp from the path that they guided to him, and they were forbidden to them from the one The exalted, and that the lost people have gone astray, so the similarity of the crushing occurred, which is that both of the two parties received a luck from the two descriptions, except that you are taught to all the righteousness It is guided that those who are watched with those who are lost are without the angry against them in the misguidance, so what is angry with them is angry, because their misguidance is a chain of transmission.Jews are an example of the first and Christian parties from the secondary of the second group, as the hadith was mentioned by the Prophet ﷺ in the Gammat al -Tarmahi and its good.And what was mentioned in the effect of the interpretation of the angry against them in the Jews and the guests of the Christians, so it is from the same way The Arabs know the Jews in Khaybar and Al -Nadir, and some inhabitants of the city and in the Arabs of Yemen.And they knew the Christians of the Arabs, such as a cavity, a dog, and some of the judges, and all of those are spoiled, changed, and confused about the righteous path of the righteous.And they separated in the structures of the methods of recession in that.(P-200) The Jews are repeated to their prophets and their composers, and they changed the project as a pillar, so they were obliged to describe the angry upon them.And the Christians have gone astray after the dialogue, and they understood the meaning of the sanctification in Jesus, peace be upon him, so they claimed the son of God on the truth.And do not follow the whims of people They gave up before and preferred many and gave up on both the ways [Al -Ma’idah: 77] and in the description of the path responsible in his saying, “The path of the path [Al -Fatihah: 6] with the righteousness of the righteousness that the righteousness The argument of the argument does not give his people to the misguided air, as he said that I say that I am my Lord, my Lord, to a straight path, a valuable religion [Al -Anam: 161] and he said that this is my savage Follow the paths, and separate from it from his path [Al -Anam: 153], on a difference in the paths of the injury of God Almighty, and for that, the Prophet said: And he made a single reward for him, "and the Children did not leave the project.You are on the right right [Ants: 79] and the readers are different in the movement of this destiny from his saying (you have been blessed with them) and his saying other than the one who is angry with them, and what is wrong with them The guarantee of a gathering and a male and female is a feminine of the absences after J, a hook, for the masses read it by breaking the distraction from the heart of the heart, because it is a thick of the heart, because the distress is that It was reversed after the ya, and it was the same as the crushing of the fracture or the dwelling of the dwelling, and that is a vulnerable, and this is a language of measure, Tamim and Sa`d ibn Bakr.He read the Hamza on them and their son, only by the distraction of the distraction and what was only broken by the distraction.Yaqoub read every guarantee of this tribe from what was before the distraction, in which J, is a hippocampus.We have mentioned this here, so we do not restore his remembrance in his proverbs, which is what refers to the signs of the knowledge of readings in the Edbar.And they also differed in the movement of Mim.By the Mim, and he read Ibn Katheer and Abu Jaafar and they said in a narration about him with a saturated guarantee, “other than those who are angry with them”, and it is a language for them.Ladid: They are their lords, and they are their rulers, so he came to the two languages, and he read a spray with the sacrifice of the mim and its saturation if it was signed after the mice, without the time of the one who is the same Everyone is on the parking of the M.In standing.* * * (p-201) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of the cow, as well as this surah, Surah al-Baqara in the narrator, from the Prophet ﷺ and what was done in the words The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever reads the two verses from the last wall of the cow, he will stop him.He deprived the merchants in the wine.And its name was called that it was mentioned in the story of the cow, which God commanded the children of Israel, by sacrificing it to be a verse and described it, so it is a misunderstanding of you, It is from what this surah was separated by its remembrance, and when it was added to the story of the cow, it is distinguished for it from the wall, the pain, from the forefathers, because they were They made these cuts the seductive nations of the luminous, they are in it and introduced it to it as a result: Taha, Wes, and S, and in the agreement on the one who is the one who is the one who said: Everything above, and this is not a knowledge of it, but it is a class.Likewise, the saying of Khalid Bin Maadan, it is the brightness of the Qur'an and the eminence, which surrounds the place to surround it with many judgments.The cow surah came down with the city with the agreement, and it is the first thing that came down in the city and the son of a stone told the explanation of the Bukhari who agreed upon it, and it was said that it was revealed.He accepted it, based on the fact that the Sufa of the Wrap is a civilian, and there is no doubt that the cow surah is in it the imposition of fasting, and fasting was imposed in the first Sunnah of the migration, and the sake The fast of Ramadan was imposed in the second year, because the prophet ﷺ fasted seven samples, the first of which was Ramadan from the second year of the migration.So the cow surah was descended in the first year of the migration in its slopes or in the second.And in Al -Bukhari, “On the authority of Aisha, the wine of the cow came down, except when I had the Prophet” ﷺ - and he was building the Messenger of God on Aisha in the shawl of the Sunnah of the Sunnah.It was said in the first year of the second year, and it was narrated from it that it had a ninety years of age, so it was fulfilled, and it is the daughter of the tenth of the age of one year, and it is a year.The cow’s surah is disturbed by the rulings of Hajj and Umrah, and on the rulings of fighting from the partners in the month of the forbidden and the country of the forbidden country is mentioned that it is the same as the time of the Sunnah We will show him with a verse, so if you are in line with what is easy from the guidance [Al-Baqarah: 196] (P-202), and it may be a period of time after a year as long as it is a year.The most famous known [Al -Baqarah: 197] The verses to his saying to those who feared [Al -Baqarah: 203] that it was said that his saying and fear a day in which they are returned to God: From the Qur’an, and we have shown us in the eighth presenter that the descent of the surah has continued, and it will be descended in the period of the period of its coming out another illumination.The Surah of the Grand Qarb has been the seller of the pictured and the people in the formation of the surrounding the surgeon, after the Sufa Sufin and before the family of Amran.And if this surah was descended in the first era in the establishment of the Islamic college, and the scholars of Islam were resigned in their city, it was one of the first purposes of this universal.Islamic from mixing with the correspondence of spinning because God has established it from the righteousness in pursuit of the formation of the virtuous city of the pure and the virtues And if it was the first Surah came down after the migration, so the supporters were given to me and they were kept on her memorization, which indicates that what came in the biography is that “when the Muslim reveals, the Muslim said: For the sacrifice, O Mubasir Al -Ansar, O people of the Samara, meaning the tree of the sale in the Hadaybiyah, O people of Surah al -Baqara, and the supporters said: And in the foot, Malik said that he had informed him that Abdullah ibn Omar was staying on the wall of the cow eighty years he learned, and in Sahah al -Bukhari: The cow and the family of Amran were writing for the Prophet ﷺ then he returned to the last story.The number of two hundred and five hundred and a verse at the people of the number is in the city, Mecca and the Levant, and six and we are safe at the people Basra.* * * (P-203) This surah is selected, its frames, and its kinds have anecdotal.It was collected from the welfare of the purposes of the light, which was not a friend of the sake of the Qur’an.Do not be able to count the merits with account, and in view to be monitored by the consequences of it, while it comes to us from its interpretation, but this is not a pleasure from us.From them, the weaving of the occasions and the rhetorical of the rhetorical of the rhetoric of the arbitrator in the word of speech, and a damage of the word of words.And the greatest of its purposes is divided into two sections: a division that proves the poison of this religion on what it preceded, and its guidance, and the origin of its purification, and the purification Religion is to follow it and give them their society.It was the best of what is the best of the rhetoric of the rhetorical methods, the methods of the legislative books, and the methods of remembrance and the prestige, In the same way as the activity of those with the mastery of the Afan, and it is prepared for us from its purposes that it started with the symbol to limit the Arabs who are in the way The openness of which is a symbol that requires their honor to what he wants after him and waiting for them to mean his intent The symbolism is a gesture to some of that symbolism, it has the most severe on their souls, so you will wait for what he follows from the sacrifice And if you were in a rapper from what we have revealed to our servants, then they brought a wall of his like [Al -Baqarah: 23] verses.So he adjusted them to the same one, with this book of this book, and its guidance, and saved to the manufacture of people, directed by this book, and its interest in them.Four (and before the migration two sinks) according to the disagreement of their conditions in that giving.And when the most important items were a benefit in its guidance, they are the believers in the absence of the evaluated prayer, meaning the Muslims, it is the beginning of their remembrance, and it was not the same.And the sacrifice of the traditions and the hypocrites, the two spuries, the two of the two vehicles, are one, so they were pushed with the deadly arguments and the brightest warfares, and then the one who is a man He distorted them for their hypocrisy, and as a result of their sacrifice and their obedience, and then the conclusion of what was brought up with them.He resorted to possibility.The Sunnis devote themselves to the prolonged and the dignity, and he throws in the decisions of themselves the humiliation of the defeat and the sincerity of the Messenger, which is united, so that it was from the response (P-204) The chest has expanded the field of calling the descriptions to the worship of the Lord, the truth, which created them and created the heavens and the earth, and blessed them with what is in all the earth.And it is concluded to the adjective of the beginning of the creation of the human being, for it is a reminder to them for the
