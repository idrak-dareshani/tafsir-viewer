The researcher, so we have made you a nation and a simplicity to be a testimony on people, and the Messenger will be a martyr upon you.This sentence is exposed between a sentence that will say the fools [Al -Baqarah: 142] etc.The numbers, for the precedent verse, when she indicated that those who guided them to a straight path are Muslims, and that this is a good thing for them to be a good.The last of them is the best of what it is presented and is the virtue of the universe of Muslims as a choice (P-15) to testify to the nations because the verses that occurred after the same, in which they are in the past This verse does not relate to the kiss.And his saying, as well as a compound from sufficient similarity and the name of the sign, so that the definition of the referred to him is known to him, and what is similar to him.A nation and a simplicity.So his explanation at the report of his words and his intention to see him: Al -Baydawi said: Referring to the concepts, that is, what he understood from his saying is the exalted to the guidance of the one who guides who is the one who will be guided by That is, as we made you a nation and a simplicity, or as we made before you preferred before, we made you a nation.Uh, that is, his saying guides whoever creates [Al -Baqarah: 142] This makes the kaf remaining in the sense of similarity, and it was not brought up to the description of the bright scouts with the strangeness, as if he saw that the name of the sign does not seek to the one The remote indication was that it used to be a distance of the distance and in which there is a look, and the referred to it is on this face, which is presented in the words of the preceding Apply in science, it is a neighbor of the Sunnah of the references.The shouting of the scouts was carried out, other than the appearance of the likeness, as for Al -Tayyibi and Al -Qutb, they said: The sufficient has a name in the sense of the same as the one who is angry on the one.To make you; That is, the like of the wondrous, we have made you not like it, but it is a representative of the condition, and the referred to it is what is understood from the guarantees of his saying, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the affairs Total, and the direction of the etiquette with the remote indication of the greatness of the referred to it, which is what he was in the scouts with the strange raising, so the fading is here for the good Al -Qutb, a leg, was caught by the chest of his words.As for the royalty, the owner of the revelation and the imbalance, it is clear that the kaf is broken as the Zaydah, it does not indicate analogy and does not like it, so he becomes the name of the reference to this.A divorced effective to make you, as if it was said that he made you, that is, so that he changed from the source to the name of the deputy from him, because this is the case of this.With the name of the sign from the mark of the diminishing dimension in it for the distance of the arrival.And similar to this direction is intended from the exaggeration of the delusion that if he wanted the likeness to liken this in his westernity, he did not find it, and he did not like it, but he is not like him Among the saying of the jungle: “The sorry is its name” (P-16), so the kaf is not an increased, nor is it for the suspicion, but it is a closeness of the increase and the sign, then the reference is to what is not.And the words of the scouts appear in this carrier, so it is indicated by his permissibility in his organs.The meaning of any of that is the one that we have brought out and inherited it.And he knew that the one who was accompanied by the scout to this carrier is to seek the name of the reference in this and its proverbs is not in which it is mentioned that it is not what he is not.It is referred to referring to it in this verse and in the verse of the poetry of the poets, but the owner of the scouts has been afraid of that in his saying, the exalted in the Surah Al -Anam, and so, he made us to make us [Al -Anam: 112] And he said: As we gave us between you and between your enemies, as well as we did with those before you from the prophets and their enemies.Uh and what he said in this verse is good.But they did not harm the view in it.And investigating me that the origin of “as well as” is to be seen by something with something and that is similar to it, a phenomenon indicated by him or like a pretext, so he is a claim, so he is the one who is the one who is the one who is a claim, so it is the same A reminder like his saying, as well as your Lord, if he takes the villages while they are unjust [Hood: 102] a sign of his saying and what we have been wronged, but they did not oppress them.The God of their God who calls without God [Hood: 101] the verse.And as the napsteller said: The safety was safe, as well as Noah was not betrayed, and the likeness of it was the one who is noticeable to it, a concept of the one The analogy and the adoption of the absolute active as the saying of my father Tamam: ؎ This is how the sermon will be done, and the matter will be rewarded.Al -Tabrizi said in his explanation: Referring to the greatest and the elaboration, and he is in the chest of the poem, and he did not precede what he likened to, so he seized the view in it from the one who is in it.The meaning of the suspicion, uh, it means that the poet referred to the great juvenile, which is the death of Muhammad ibn Hamid al -Tousi, and the same is the saying of the lion in the poets of the Hamas.Fah, so the time goes and wins the knowledge in it and taught the effect (P-17), and it was said by the Exalted, and so we made you a nation and a simplicity on what is good.It may be intended to intend for good and make it as if it is what the speaker sees it, then he does not find that he likens to it and this is the same To look at the likeness in the fall, and the same is the saying of one of the poets, a vision in the literature from the Hammah: I have been taught this wondrous, and the saying of Zahir: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ This tribe is when the scouts are wounded, and it is the truth, and it is clear from it in this sense, the saying of the Almighty, and so, then some of them were killed by one [Al -Anam: 53] However, that God has called, the exaggeration of a temptation, taking from the verb of our fatwa.Referring to this bearer referred to to it is taken from the words delayed from the name of the sign as you taught a nose to make the one who made it, and it is the one who made it, Taken al -Yaghi in the position of diving, as the Almighty said, he said this is a parting between me and between you [Cave: 78] or from the words offered by the name of the sign as it is for me as it is the name The guidance that is taken from his saying is the Almighty who guides whoever follows [Al -Baqarah: 142].And the middle: a name for the place between the place between a place that surrounds it or to the one who falls between the things that are surrounded by it, and it is not to the one who is close to it, and it is one of it.It only falls after the choice of what is surrounded by it, in which the meaning of maintenance and pride is taken in it, as the medium The grass and the pain, and put it, as the medium of the king With the ease, and the intermediate of the contract for the same thing in it.The breath is a seed, Zahir said: ؎ They are a simple one who satisfies the people with their ruling ∗∗∗ If one of the Levant is a muscular and said: The highest said: “Do you not say,” It is said to be the same as its silence.As for the release of the mediator on the next characteristic of two creation (P-18), two of them are excessive and deviation, such as the courage between the forehead, and the ritual, and the ritual, And the equivalent between the mercy and the harshness, so it is metaphor with the similarity of the thing that is inspired by the sensual thing.These two divisions were popular until two realities became two years.The mediator in this verse was interpreted by the choice for his saying, "You were the best of a nation that was brought out to people [Al -Imran: 110] and it was interpreted with the enemy, Al -Tarmahi in his Sunnah from the hadith of Abu Saeed Al -Khudari on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ, and he said: Good is correct, and the collection is The two interpretations is the face, as we presented it in the ninth presentation.And the nation was described by the form of the remembrance because it is a rigid name, so it is for its criminality, in which it is mentioned in it.With the description with the difference of the like: I saw the two increases these two, for it is described in the name of the preservatives of the bond of its significance on a grace, but it is a sign of the righteousness.And the opponent of the addressees here is intended by the collection of Muslims to repeat it to fending for the sake of the kaaba, so everyone who prayed for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, It was interpreted in the authentic hadith that it is the martyrdom of the nation, all of which is on the nations, so the guerrilla does not conclude with the guidance on the day of the coming of the verse.And the verse is a praise for the Muslims, because God has blessed them with grace and made them a simplicity of what he had for their causes in Bayyan Al -Shura’i, who made it.The misguidance that was shared on the nations, the pride of the religion said: It is permissible to be and simple in the sense that they are interrupted in the religion between the one who is overwhelming They did not boil as the Christians were overwhelmed, so they made the Christ the son of God, and they did not shorten as they were shortened, so they changed the books and hid with the messengers.The people of the foundations of jurisprudence inferred with this verse that the consensus of the nation’s scholars, that is, the mujtahids, is a legal argument, so that they are all over it, and in this way, and in this way, and in the same The first: Al -Fakhr said: God has informed the nature of the nation and its best.Hajj, uh, that is, because the group of the Mujahids is the same in cutting off the view of the succession of the backwardness and the description of the elevation in some of their individuals, and this is not the same, and this is not the same The goodness, so the verse does not indicate their silence from mistake, while they all (P-19), and this is a capable response, and it is answered that the fullness is the whole.Two ways of excess and dedication, the adultery of the infallibility of the entirety of all in the mistakes in the sayings, the acts and the unable, Because their equilibrium, uh, it means that the verse required the full adjustment to the nation’s meeting Praise be upon them, including what is in this verse, and this is referring to the first way, the third way: a group said: the speech of the companions and they are not gathered by On the consensus in the sentence, and it is mentioned that the completion of the companions does not contradict the error in the guidance, and their gathering may be from the dove We will remember it.And the right to me is that the verse is openly in the fact that the description is mentioned in it is a praise for the nation of all of it, not for the specialists of its scholars, so there is no meaning for the sake of it.It is one of the conditions of some of the nation, not from all the conditions of its whole, for the face is that the verse is indicative of the pilgrimage of the collection of the nation in what is the transmission of the transmission of the one who is the one With the frequencies and what is known from religion with the harm, which is the agreement of Muslims on the proportions of a saying, a verb or a characteristic of the prophet ﷺ from what is a matter Like the numbers of prayers and rak'ahs and the description of the prayer and the pilgrimage and the same as the transmission of the Qur’an, and this is one of the conditions of the proof of the law, in which the complexes are made, and this is the one who is the one who is the same They said with the disbelief of one of the gathering of it, and it is the one in which Abu Bakr al -Baqlani was expressed and the horizons of the people, and it is considered in it other than the number The fundamentalists are presented to all evidence.As for the fact that the verse is a sign of the gathering of the mujahidi from the view and the dasts, it is not taken from the verse except that it is said: The verse is desired by it, so that it is for you.It was informed that God Almighty made this nation a simplicity, and our knowledge is that the mediator is the option that is just out of between the two ways of excess and the devotion of our knowledge that God knows best.The nation with what is created by their minds from the accusative of the correct and the foolishness in which the hot delusions in which the minds of the nations are hot, and from the one who is from the nations, and from the good The stereotypes of the enemies and the evidence of its rulings with the subordination to the nose of the nose of the scholars and understanding the lineage of the public, so if it is so that it is necessary The nation is a valuable mind, and it is the meaning of its universe, and then this residence is different from what is appropriate for every nature of the nation, and all the individual, and the righteousness of the (P-20) We have proven to the collection of the nation our saying: This group does not fall into the delusion, neither a pillar nor a mistake, but the baptism is because it contradicts the enemy, and it is not wrong.The opinion of the opinion, if it is permissible to make a mistake on their ones, it is not permissible to refuse all of their scholars on the mistake, and the two things have fallen to the past nations, so they are the past A follow -up to one of them is that they did not warn them of that or because they offended their interpretation, then the general public takes a share of this from this The transitional part only, and this is the continuation of the recipient.And his saying to be a degree of cause to make them and simplicity.As the issuance of the heart, it says some of the philosophers, Nor with a duty and a glory, as it is deluded by the expressions of the dismissed, and if they want them to be better, they wanted that that is a duty for its highness to the fullness of his rule.And (people) is general and what is meant by the past nations and those present, and this testimony is a worldly and other world.As for the worldly world, it is the ruling of the nation of the nation on the past nations and those present with the justification With their messengers and those who are old in the domination of their inspiration after the coming of its people and the appearance of the right, and this is a great religious ruling, if the mother is upon him The presentation of all of the tachs is accustomed to the criterion of the critical critic.And the other testimony is what Al -Bukhari and Al -Tarmahi narrated from Abu Saeed Al -Khudayri.So he asks his nation, whether you are informing you, and they say what came to us from the vibrant, and he says: God is your testimony?The Messenger of God, “ﷺ, and we made you a nation and a simple one who said just to be a testimony of people, and the Messenger will be a martyr on you.So his saying, “Then a reciter” indicates that this testimony is from the sentence of the meaning of the verse, not that it is the meaning of the meaning of the verse, and the most promising from the explanation is the martyr A nation and a simplicity, and as for the coming of the testimony of the hereafter on its class, then this is because we know that the conditions of the hereafter are on the authority of the worlds of the world, and he said: Live as a light, and we will be gathered on the day of resurrection, blind [Taha: 124] My Lord said: “Why did you be mourned with me, and I was a visionary [Taha: 125] Forget [Taha: 126].(P-21) It is the meaning of the meaning of martyrdom on the people in the world and the duty of our nations calling for Islam, so that the place of the call of the Messenger will be made to them The believers of them are exposed.And testimony on the nations will be for them and them, but it is satisfied with the verse by its transgression by indicating that the greatest martyr The believers have witnessed their faith.They are those who are witnessing and in the case of their transmission with his veiled intercourse, which is the endowment of those who disagree with them, according to their martyrs.And his saying, and the Messenger will be a martyr upon you, a martyr who is given to the cause, and there is no second cause because it is not intended by the self, but it is the first of the first.Because we made a simplicity that is caused by the presence of the pilgrimage to the testimony of us and the extent of the testimony of us, and the world is the testimony of the Messenger to us In it it is his testimony in itself on his two contemporaries and the testimony of his law on those who came after him, either by their deaths, what he answered, and the part of them, The other is what was narrated in the hadith that is presented from the testimony of the Messenger with the truth of the nation, as it witnessed it, and what was narrated in the other hadith in the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the past.I am tied, and say, O Lord, my nation, and he says: You do not know what to speak after you, they changed and changed, so I say: A crushing is a crushing for those who replace me." The martyrdom of the Messenger is prepared for the nation with a risk of problems for his saying before him to be a testimony on people, otherwise it is a martyr of the mother of the mother A martyr of sophisticated and vigorous meaning in the two situations as in the scouts.This verse has been indicated by intending to testify and honor it until the knowledge appears in everything that he does not make up until after its obtaining, and it is taken from it, A martyr of what he obtained from knowledge, even if the witnesses are not witnessed by him, and that he testifies to science with hearing, and the evidence of the veil, and if he did not Zakat is a great origin in testimony, and that the zakat must be better and more than amended than the zakat, and that the zakat does not need the zakat, and that the nation does not ﷺ And for this, he used to say in the pilgrimage of the deposit, “Do you not reach, and they will say yes, and he says to God, I bear witness.And the progress of the neighbor and the boundary is presented to his workers, I only see it for the extermination of the perpetrator (P-22) by sharing this nation until it is witnessed by the matter Its messenger, and it might be his presentation to be the word that the verse is concluded in the place of the stand as a word with a tide before the letters of the last For a stand, and this is from the plight of the Qur’an, and the boundary of the bomber is said to be beneficial to the palace of the verb on the verb, and it is a cost and the same is like it.* * * And what made us the kiss that you were on, except to know whoever follows the Messenger from those who turn to his two hinders, and if you are a great one who is a great one On a sentence, he will say the fools from the people [Al -Baqarah: 142] and what he communicated from the answer to his saying, Say to God, the Mudhariqah and the West [Al -Baqarah: 142] The sanctuary of the sanctuary, then it turns into a grade of the kaaba, and what is between the two sentences from his saying, and so we made you a nation and the last of it.And making here make the legislation with the way that its effective is one of the affairs of worship, not from the affairs of creation, and it is the memorial of the kiss, and that is so, so he did.One because it is the meaning of our law, so these verses It came down after the matter by the way to the Kaaba, so it will be the intention of the sanctuary, and it was adjusted from the definition of the supporter in his name to the communion of the words of the words When they said what they have before their before they were on which they were upon them [Al -Baqarah: 142] with gesture to the knowledge of the wisdom referred to to it by saying it, except for what we know, We copy it, so we have a time, except to know, etc.And the discretion in its saying is only to know the abuse of the heart and the diligence of that, that is, what made us for that because The sanctuary and the conversion of the seed.And Abd al -Hakim mentioned that it was narrated that some Arabs wanted to Islam when the Messenger of God received the house of the sacred, the name Be interpreted for themselves to excuse them in the preacher of Islam, as we decided when he said, and if they are met by those who believe, they said: We believed out [Al -Baqarah: 14] For the prayer with him that it is a worship of God Almighty and a increase in their prayers that they are kept on it if they were given to their thighs with their prayers with their prayers with their prayers with those who do not The most of their rituals (P-23) contradicts the approval of the holy house, and when the kiss was transformed, the row of prayer has become a contradiction to the ritual of the ritual Inspector because it is obligatory to be excluded, so they did not remain for them for the following.And the knowledge of God Almighty has made those who follow the Messenger and whoever turns against his two hurricanes on the cause of these two legislators, it is necessary for him to get the time of the time It is required by the mother of the illusion and the ability to do the same, and that the letter is upright with the fact that God knows that and he is subject to him and does not happen and does not happen to him The knowledge of that is the relationship of its knowledge to the struggle of the thing that is known in the eternal that it will happen, so this is a special attachment and it is a sharp thing because it is like the relationship The speakers forgive his promise to attach science.And you have to make his saying to know whoever follows the Messenger as a year for him to know that everyone who does not know about the way of the rituals of the ritual He wants the knowledge of people as Iyas ibn Qabbah al -Ta’i said: ؎ I am emitted and the sin is dangerous among us to know who is from her courage, he wanted to see it So the people know it and the people know, so the Qur’an came in this verse and its organizations on these chains, and you will make it a fennel from the part of the part What is appropriate for it, and for you to make “we know” is metaphor from the bias to appear to people with a word of words.The chapter, as Ibn Malik and Ibn Hicham called it, and it is in the truth of the territory of the suffering of “the“ Al -Baqdiya ”as the owner of the singer appears, and this is not a matter of you How can the ulcers be a cause for the valuable science, as it becomes clear to you that it is a return to my vile.And the conversion: the return to the place that came from it, it is said that it is said to the house, and its saying on its two followers (P-24) is an increase in affirmation in the return to what was behind it because it was behind it because it was behind it because it was behind it because it was behind it.The two legs, that is, turned on the way of its two comments, and it is an octagonal borrowing for the excess of Islam, in return to the precedent infidels.And “who” is a communication, and it is the act of “we know” and the knowledge in the sense of the knowledge and its action exceeds one of the most effective.And his saying, even if you are a greatness, except for those who guided God, kindness on a sentence, and what we have made the kiss that you were on, and the appropriateness is that it was a predecessor, because it was a senior The cause is for a sentence, “We know who follows the Messenger.The grave, and the feminine guarantee is a source of the conversation or the kiss with the adoption of its change.It is reduced from the ritual.And the great is here in the sense of the embarrassing hardness of the Nafus.The Arabs say: He grew up with it if it was a hardship on its soul as his saying, even if their symptoms grew up with them [Al -Anam: 35].* * * And what God would have lost your faith is that God is the people of the Most Merciful, the Passion of the Perform Him, and they are not lost in your faith.And the remembrance of the name of the majesty from the appearance in the place of guests to the great.Al -Bukhari narrated on the authority of Al -Barai ibn Azib, who said, “He died before the kissing before the men who were killed, and we did not know what to say in them, so that God was not.”.And in his saying “they were killed,” there was no way before the kissing of the kiss and we will be shown, and we will come out of the kiss, and he said: “He said:“ Al -Kaaba said, O Messenger of God, how is our brothers who died while praying to the house of the sanctuary, so God revealed: “And God would not have lost your faith.” And the loss: the contradiction of the thing and its effects of its effects, and the interpretation of faith on its appearance, and also was interpreted by prayer, which the Qaribbi transmitted from your money.And it is suspended by a waste of faith on added estimation, so if the faith is pleased with its appearance, the estimation was: to waste (P-25), the right of your faith when you did not go away and the will be removed from it.Installing to a kiss that you do not want, and if faith is interpreted by prayer, the ability: God would not have been lost, the best of your prayers or its rewards, and in the release of the name of the prayer [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection
