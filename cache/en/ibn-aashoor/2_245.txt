The researcher of the Wasim, who is a good loan, is a good loan, and he will be blessed with many weak weakness Their paths [Al -Baqarah: 243] to the last, and the sentence did you not see to the fullness of the children of Israel [Al -Baqarah: 246] the verse, it was intended to go to search for spending in the way of spending, For the occasion of urging the fighting, the fighting calls to spend the fight against himself in the enemy and the hundred with the urging of the expenditure of the existence of the one in the way For those who have no number for him, and the spending on the hardships of the running, and in it there are two evidence of the sentences of a sentence and know that God is a knowledgeable hearing [Al -Baqarah: 244] And (the loan) is the ancestors of money and the like with the intention of returning it like it, and it is called a metaphor for the sake of the part of the penalty, so it is comprehensive with this meaning, the meaning of the A verb is annexed in its right and metaphor.And the understanding is in his saying who is the one who lends to God, who is used to embrace and rejoice in despair as good, as if the one who is the one who does not know is the one who does not know.Tarfa: If the people say: Whoever came to me, I did not mean that I was not lazy and did not spoil and (that) after the names of the congestion, it may be in the way of what is in the way of it.You saw a person that you do not know: (Whoever is), then if it is not in the place of the words, something is reconciled because it is referred to to it with the interrogation, it was the use of (the) The metaphor that the speaker in his mind imagines a person who is angry, and he is a verb, so he asks for his help, but that is for him, but that is for you With the verb, and the definition of his actor and the being of this recipient is required to be a remembrance of the verb after the name of the sign, the grammarians said: The understanding turns into a vague and vague name that is not with a seam.He (P -482) and not to be like he who is with what is with (what) and (who) in the understanding, and it (who is) is in a house that is “what” - that is, or who - the ritual of the one who is not - Or who - with a single name of one name, "and his representative saying," What did your Lord descend?So they shorten this recovery on (the), and they are not intended that with the interrogation, it becomes the name of the connection; It is a lot in the words that there is a connected name after it, as in this verse, and there is no meaning to the fall of my name, the one who has reached themselves, and only one of them The name of the communication, so it will be the act of the afternoon or the description in the sense of the link The connector, but they wrote that because they forgot what the “stroke” is in the interrogation of the metaphor, so it was a few seriousness.And the face is that (the) in the interrogation does not come out of his being for the sign, but rather is a metaphor sign, and the action that comes after it is in the position of the situation.So, his saying is the Almighty, what did your Lord descend [Al -Nahl: 24] and Zan is the saying of Yazid ibn Rabi'a ibn Mufar, who addresses his sudden: Doing the loan.And the loan: the predecessor, and it is the same thing to respond to its likeness or its equality, and it is used here in the vulgarity that the part of the part of it is made in the way And partial.And described the loan with goodness, because God does not satisfy him unless he is innocent of the districts of lime and harm, as the nobility said: It is not the same The authority, and perhaps he was hung in the name of the Majesty, because the one who lends to people to the reward as if he lends to God Almighty; Because the loan is one of the charity that God has commanded in it and in the sense of this what came in the Qudsi Hadith: God is glorified and exalted, and he says the day of resurrection: “O son of Adam Lord and how I feed you, and you are the Lord of the two worlds.Hadith.They narrated that the reward of the charity is ten days and the reward of the loans is twenty -ten He read the gathering, and he would be doubled by a thousand after the opposite, and Ibn Katheer read it, Ibn Amir, Abu Jaafar, and Jacob.With a thousand after the opposite, and with the tightness of the eye.He raised (and he will be doubled) in the readers ’readings, on kindness to lend to enter into the perception of (P-483) to be punished for lending in the acquisition, And Asim, and Jacob: by setting the fulfillment of the answer to the incubation, and the meaning of both readings is one.And his saying, and God is the arrest and the basis of the origin of the grip: tension and conjunction, and the origin of the simplicity: against the grip, which is divorce and the launch, and it was separated from this meaning: In the sense of taking a chapel vineyard [Al -Baqarah: 283] and in the sense of scarcity, and they will hold their hands [Repentance: 67] and the simplicity in the sense of the virtue of God And in the sense of generosity, but it is the same as two bastions [Al -Ma’idah: 64] and from its names is up to the Almighty: the wasting, the medium, in the sense of the obstacles, the gave, and the reader of the ritual: On the authority of Ibn Katheer, Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim, Al -Kisa’i, Abu Jaafar, and Rawah from Yaqoub, in the holy one while he is a language.It is impeded that what is meant here is: the gifts and charity are heard, and the reward is simplified and the reward, and it is impossible that the meant is a sponge of goodness, and it is simplified, and it is a matter of good By promising expansion on the hypocrisy in the path of God, and the abode of the imagination.In The hadeeth, “O God, give a successor and a successful successor,” and in Ibn Attiyah on the authority of Al -Halwani on the authority of they said about Nafaa: that he does not come to me, how can he read it.That is, because they are two languages, such as the path and the path, and the origin is the cinema, but it turned in a stroke in his midst and the stomach of the rituals after it, and the exit of it, Because the resignation from the cinema to the lean is a wealthy with the disagreement of the hunter.And his saying, and to him, you will return an alert and recall that what was prepared for them in the hereafter from the penalty on spending in the way of God is the greatest of God The world, in which it is an illusion that the hungry holder is about spending in the path of God, a hidden one of the many good.It was narrated that when the verse came down, “Abu al -Dahdah came to the Messenger of God ﷺ He said, or that God wants the loan from us?” He said: Yes, Abu Al -Dahdah, he said: So I have leased to God in which a chain of transmission is in it, so the Messenger of God ﷺ said, “How many hurts and a righteous house in the paradise of the father of Dahdah”.
