The Qur’anic researcher, you make God a display of your faith, to be justified, feared, and reconcile among the people, and God is the most knowledgeable, given to you, with a sentence of the ritual of you.[223] Fellow project on a legitimacy, as the appropriateness between the two sentences is related to their two guarantees with the rulings of the custody of the curtains with the costume of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first The costumes are in the case of menstruation, and they are the ones who are included in this sentence for those who are familiar with their women [Al -Baqarah: 226], so this gift is signed by the satellite A plow for you [Al -Baqarah: 223] and a sentence for those who hope from their women [Al -Baqarah: 226], and he walked into the way of kindness; Because it is forbidden to have been forbidden in his saying and do not bring them closer until they purify themselves [Al -Baqarah: 222] and Al -Tafazani said: The appearance is that he is given to me.That is, they are the same as what I have commanded and do not make God an uh.And in it is a cost and a vulnerability from the appearance of the occasion, and the permissibility of the Tafizani: that it be given to the precedent orders, which are presented, and they were given, and the awareness of you.[223] That is, the appropriateness is that when he commanded them to be brought up on the day of his meeting, there is something of piety to the piety of the angel of the hidden hidden, which is the piety in the end of the name.For piety from the events that are related to the names, it is that it is related to the name of the name, not by its memorial, because the rulings are the righteous, but it is the same On her attachment to the names like his name, Muhammad, so he came with this verse for the exemption of what is arranged by the greatestness of the name of God and the righteousness of God in the name of God Bayan what was licensed in it, or for the warning of the warning that its name is up to the height of the height in the abundance of the milk until it is not obligated to the ritual of the ritual This is all of it, so it is forbidden from it that the coming of his saying is exalted and fear God and know that you are met him [Al -Baqarah: 223] That a rule that is accustomed to it is overlooked, because it is lengthened by the dissolution and the abuse of the brevity, and Abd al -Hakim said: Do not make God a display or a saying: “If you make his saying and offer from the sentence of saying, say, and remind a group of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said It came down when Abu Bakr al -Saddik is not aggravated by his relatives.On the authority of it, and the one said about Al -Kalbi: I descended in the servant of God ibn Ra’ah: A solution that he would not speak to his sister, his sister, Bashir Bin Al -Naaman, and he does not And between his wife, and whatever the affairs of kindness, this sentence must be bound With something of the words before it.And Al -Ja'al is attached to the self here is in the sense of attaching in the name, so appreciation: and do not make the name of God, and delete for the many of the poorest in the same way For the appearance of a good health that is related to the verb with the name, as the saying of the nap: The name of God for the woman is a gold.(P-377) and the presentation: a name on the weight of the verb, which is a weight that indicates the verb, such as the nipples, the knife, and the shaking, and it is derived from: its presentation, if it puts it on the side of the side, that is, the one who puts it on the side of the side.The offer here makes something needed from their saying, the offer of the oud on the pot, and he arose from that release of the presentation on the pilgrim, the exposure, which is a great release.And it was released on what the whole group around it, as if they were exposed to the victory and sought in the scouts: and do not make me a lukewarm for the hands The two meanings.And the blame is in the saying of your faith in the mother of the preparation The abstinence of righteousness, piety, and prayer, then you say before us, and it is permissible for the pain to be to be illuminated: that is, do not make God to be the best of you The ritual is not to be justified.And the faith: a group of days, which is the solution, the name of the milk is given to the right of the right, which is one of the hands and it is the hand that the human being does, and it is the most common one, and it is the most.Because the hand is easy with the verb with it, the most good of the other hand, and the sweetness was called a right, because the Arabs were from their habit, if they are in the case of the one who will be blessed The other, the Almighty said: Those who sell you, but they will sell God the hand of God, above their hands [Al -Fath: 10], so they would say: He gave his right, if he assured the era.And that was popular in their words, he said, as the son of Bin Zuhair: ؎ So I put my right to me, and I will not be dismissed.A dream, so the name of the solution is in the name of the name of the thing in the name of its comparison with which it is comparable to it, or from the name of the thing in the name of its place; As they called water, but the place in this name is on this direction, an optional solution.And when they were mostly their faith in the lusts and the solution, and it is in which the professionals are placed in them (P-378), some of them, some of them, the release of the right to the right of the right to all of you Most of the conditions; So the right was released on the section of the woman in the same soul without a covenant or a solution.And the intention of the jelly is referring to the intention of the human being, the human being, may God bless him: in news, promise, or relationship.Therefore, he says: (God) I am tired of the stress of God, or the most promising, or suspended by the stress of God on the achievement of that, so whoever is in the right of that is in the right of the right, in the right of the right, Because whoever testifies to God on falsehood, he has dared to him and hidden with him, and what indicates that the origin of the right is the martyr of God, the saying of God: 204] As it was presented, and the saying of the Arabs: God knows, in the denominator of the thicker The waws and the vitae were later in the construction division without the arrogant.And the meaning of the verse, if the presentation is in the sense of the barrier, the Muslims are forbidden to make the name of God a inhale, without what they have done, And the righteousness is among the people, the blame for the reason, and it is related to making it, and that you justify it related to the “exposure” to the slander of the neighbor, the slander, That is, and do not make God for the sake of your solution with a need for the verb of righteousness, the righteousness, and the piety, for the verse is on this way, and it is forbidden for the sake The preservation of it is forbidden from the verb of a legitimate, and it is forbidden or promoted by the referee of the thing that is deleted on the ruling of it Calf and the large number of hurricanes, as the exposure is not informed of a lot of disagreement.And the Arabs in the ignorance were angry, so they divided God, and with her family, and her fathers, on the abuse of anything, to be bound by the two days.In the scouts, the man was around to leave the good: from the compassion of the womb, or the same compassionate, or charity, then he says I am afraid that I will be seen in my right So the verse will be and return to the deliverance of a violation of their conditions.It was said that it was descended from the solution of Abu Bakr: not to spend on his cousin.Mustaha ibn Ahthah because it is those who fought in the dismantling.And do not appear for this saying that is appropriate for the fall of the verse.It was said: I got down in the milk of Abdullah ibn Raafah: that his betrayal would not speak to Bashir Bin Al-Naaman Al-Ansari, (P-379) and he had divorced the sister of the servant of the servant of God And the reconciliation, so the servant of God is not reconciled between them.Either it is possible that the presentation is in the sense of the thing that is offered to a verb in excess, so the meaning: Do not make the name of God to be presented to him that you will be present in the name of God Righteousness, piety, and salvation among people, for the consequences of its appearances, which are the sections and the imams are related to an exposure, and that you justify the effect of the days, with a murmur, " That “and the appreciation: Do not be justified, the counterpart of his words is an advent that shows you to you to mislead [Women: 176] and it is a lot, so the verse is forbidden from the ritual By God, he left obedience; Because the greatness of God does not want to be a reason in cutting what God has commanded with his verb, and this forbidding is necessary: ​​that if the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness, will not be in the case حَرَجَ في ذَلِكَ, وأنَّهُ يُكَفِّرُ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ ويَفْعَلُ الخَيْرَ.Or with it: Do not make the name of God an exposure to the Half, as we have said, and it is his saying that you justify a verb for his sake, and it is a cause for me.That is, I forbade you to be eternal, pious, reconciled, and in the closest of this, Malik said: I rich me that he is the solution of God in everything.And for him, then the verse is forbidden to accelerate the solution, because there is a lot of al -Half.The situation is exposed to the swimmer.The many days of the ignorance of the ignorance, in the course of the righteous people from the anger and the foolishness of the fool, forbade Islam from that, and for that, they said: ؎ The heart of the Ayes is preserved for his right ∗∗∗ and if the vengeance of it was righteous, and in this sense, the offer is arrogant to what the solutions are more Like the exposure to the two intentions.It is not in the verse on these faces, what is understood by the permission in the case, without God, because the prohibition is reported from the case with the name of God and the name of God.And his saying, and God is a knowledgeable, and the knowledge of the knowledge and the intentions, and what is meant by its necessity: it is the promise of the compliance, on the whole of the On the first estimation, warning against the solution, on the second estimation.The verse was indicated in a great sense: that the greater of God does not want to make a way to give what God loves for good You return to the greatness of the name of God Almighty, and the testimony of the testimony of it on the verb that is upon him, and this is if it is a great intention to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the case, But the crops of it for the cutting of the good, which is not satisfied by God, the exalted, then the two things (P-380) have been satisfied with the people of God, if they get one of them.And God commands us to present one of the two things that are satisfied with him, which is in which he glorifies the request of his satisfaction, with the benefit of his creation with the righteousness and the righteousness, and the righteousness, His pleasure in the greatest of his name is only, as God has taught the Almighty: that the greatest name of his name was obtained when the case was embarrassed, and the slander of the rituals, and the rituals of the rituals, And the two righteous hopes are satisfactory to God; So God commanded the presentation of his illness on literature with his name, as it was said: Compliance is presented to literature.The Prophet said ﷺ: “I do not know about a right, so I see others better than it, unless I disbelieved from my right, and I did the one who is better.” His wife is a hundred Jalaja, God commanded him to take a curse from a hundred sticks, and he will bring it to him, and God has learned that this is not the intent of Ayoub; But when God did not accept from a day to strike his wife, he forbade him from that, and commanded him to decipher preserves the guardians of Ayoub on the righteousness, From him his accustomed to the greater the name of his Lord, this is a side of the dissolution, and God has fulfilled his Prophet, and perhaps the infidelity is not a hidden.He is the one who is easy and his toxins.God has suffered for us, as we have started to solve the right to the disbelief; Therefore, he became indispensable in Islam, that the case does the same as what I have done.
