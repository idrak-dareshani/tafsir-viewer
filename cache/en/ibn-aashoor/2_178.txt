The Quranic researcher, O those who believed in you, have been written in the free killing of the free and the servant with the servant and the female with the female, the rest of the speech is the one who believes.Because this is a form of legitimacy for the rulers with a mind in the Islamic community, and the desirability of its system and its security when the Muslims became after the migration, with a group.With itself and its debt, the verses were the first of what was revealed in the city in the year of the migration, as the interpreters mentioned it in the reason for its descent in the words This: And fight in the path of God who fight you [Al -Baqarah: 190].Those are the rulings that are followed by the conditions of individuals and the conditions of the community, and are prepared with the rulings of retribution; Because the greatest thing of the abuse of the conditions is the preservation of the nation’s souls, and the Arabs have been overlooked in the waste of this origin, he knows that who has a mother, and they are with them.They have been informed of them, and they will see them in that, if this is the time of that, and God would not be blessed with them with the grace of Islam, (P-135), so they would be bone of them.His impact, his servants, and his women, so that the cave is rushed to him, and the nafus is damaged between the two parties, and then he arises from that asking for the revolutions, and he will be killed, so he will be killed, so he will be killed, so he will be killed, so he will be killed.He killed his murderer and his guardian, and if he was supplemented by him, he would have killed him other than one competent for him, or a number of seeing them that they do not pay, and they are called by the domination of the blood; That is, as if the blood of the mourning is a lot of blood, then they were destroyed by two or by one, or with a vessel, and thus the matter will come to the matter, and it will be increased, Zuhair said: I turned a garment and fled after what they dedicated, and they were pious among them, and the tree of a tissue is taught, and the matter will be transmitted from one tribe to the way, and the righteousness, The tune became a fascist, and they were taken between them, and some doves were taken over, so the Persians and the Romans found a separation between them, and they will be tove And God knows his saying: “And remember the grace of God to you, when you were more enemy, so he wrote among your hearts, so you would be blessed with the goodness So I saved you from it [Al -Imran: 103], meaning: You were the most prominent causes of raids and warfare, so I wrote among you in the word Islam, and you were on the suspicion of destruction, so I will save you from it.He who does not remain anything with the hole of the fire, for the standing on its edge is not between it and between the destruction except the least movement.The meaning of (I was written on you) is that it is a right for a nation that is not neutral from taking it, so the guarantee of “upon you” for the group of the nation, for the whole of the whole, for the whole of the whole, And what is meant is: on every individual of the individual of the retribution; Because the guardian of blood has pardon for his guardian His brother is something that follows the well -being and the origin of the book, we engrave the forefathers in a stone, a tenderness, or a garment, and when that inscription is intended for it, we will not be discussed with what we do not.Remembering him, "I wrote" the meaning of the meaning: the right and the confirmation; That is: the right of the family of the dead.He is a name for a broken right or the right to sung on one of that, from the right to be fair and just, for the penalty is called the gossip, And on the account of the Lord of the debt, with what he has for the debt of a debt that is in his debt, its all recesss indicate the equivalent and the description in the facts and the rituals of the rituals.It is an effective bouzin, and it is a weighted export from the cut, which is the piece, and it is their saying: a dungeon with the sauce of the wing, and it is called the story of the story of the story.That is, the cutting, and the story of the poetry - by the guarantee of the endowment - what is short of it; Because he is running in two exchanging rights between two sides, a storyteller is said to so-and-so, so if he was given a debt in his virginity, P-136) will be condemned to him in Dhim Descriptions with cutting; Because he cut off the arbitrary before him, so he called the possibilities while he was lying to me, and the one who is killed is the murder of his murder.Aqbah, whoever wounds one of the wounds of a baptized person, is that that wounded, like what was wounded, will be excused, and he said: And the rituals are the one who is the one.In the same way as his crime, and the deprivation is divided [Al -Baqarah: 194].The Almighty said: He wrote to you in the killing, and the meaning of the penalty is carried out on killing by killing for the fight, and you will be buried in the meaning Like the rituals for him and the like, and you carry the meaning that he does not kill other than the killer of those who have no partner to kill the dead, so he said: “He said:“ Among the believers in killing the death, the right of a false death does not go and not kill the deadly deadly, and that is the heroes of what they were in the ignorant of the ignorance of the The mourning and the insults of the weakness of the weak if the strong who is afraid of his people is afraid of his people, and whoever rules them asking to kill others if he kills one of the men of a man A microfer man like him, in which they do not kill the killer unless he is a bridge for the one who was killed; That is, it is sufficient for him in honor and glory, and they consider the values ​​of the blood that is varying, according to the recession of the fence and the honor, and they are called that of the time The daughter of Haddal ibn Qarqa al -Ta’i, the stirring of her stirring on the killing of a man who killed her father, and remembers that she was not convinced of the killing of him.Tikkil Demaa: ؎ As for the sons of Hasna from the son of Karea ∗∗∗ from the people, the students of the Tawarat He was forced with a liability that he did not have ∗∗∗ a brightness, but it does not take place in the blood.This verse has been established with the killing of the baptism, and the wisdom of that is the deterrence of the people of the aggression when they are on the feet of killing the soul, if they know that they knew, if they know that For life is the most dearest to the human being in the jabbalah, so the hate of killing is not equivalent in the deterrence and the displacement, and from the rule of that, you will be tied to the sake Those who have been accustomed to their murderers said: And whoever kills a shadow, he has made us a sultan of his guardian The guardians of the murderer for the righteousness of their murderer (P-137) with themselves; Because that leads to the image of war between two nomads, and there is a lot in it, as it is presented in the speech on the chest Life [Al -Baqarah: 179] and the first blood that I bound in Islam is a blood of a man from this one who was killed by a man from the sons of Laith, so the Prophet was led from him ﷺ and he is a walk to the one who said.For him: the niche of the romance is on the way of the sect, and that is a year of eight of the migration.And “in” from his saying: “In the dead” for the metaphorical custody, and the penalty is not in the dead, so the fate is added, and the deletion of it is here for the sake The killing and the paths of the suffering of the retribution, as it is brief and blind.And the collection of (killing) by adopting the collection of the addressees; That is, in your killing, and the definition in the killing is the definition of the gender, and the dead is the one who kills it other than the people and the killing, the human being is the death of another person, so there is no one who does not Killed.And the phrase of freedom with the free and the servant with the servant and the female with the female and the separation of the sentence of the sentences that you have written in the killing of the killing of you, and the saying of it: With a deletion, the meaning of the penalty is indicated by the meaning of the punishment, and the appreciation: the free one or is killed by the free, etc.The free is killed by free, not otherwise, and the servant is killed by the servant, not otherwise, and the female is killed by the female, not otherwise, and the knowledge of this is the knowledge of this It has a milestone, but they disagreed in the propelled in which it is based on it, according to the disagreement of the fixed evidence from the book and the Sunnah, and in the intention of this and the one who is in this way Al -Muwalat: Malik said the best of what I have heard in this verse is that his saying is up to the Almighty: the free one with the free and the servant of the servant is the one who is masculine, and the saying: Be among the females, as it is between the male, and the free woman is killed by free woman as the free person is killed by free, and the nation is killed by the nation as the nation is killed, as the slave is killed, as the slave is killed, as the slave is killed, as is the slave of the nation, as it is killed.And the penalty is among the women as it is among the men, and the penalty is also among the men and women.That is, the female was allocated by the male with the fact that it is an inclusion of the general perpetrator of the free and the servant, so that it is not deluded that the form of reminder in its saying: It is intended to be male.Al-Qarbi said about a sect: The verse came indicating the rule of the species if it is killed by its type, then the ruling of the free (P-138) was shown, if it is killed, and if it is killed, if it is killed, and if it is killed, if it is killed, if he kills, if he kills, and if he kills, if he is killed, if he kills a hot, if he kills a free And the female, if it is killed by a female, and it is not exposed to one of the two types if the other is killed, then the verse is a judge and in it is a wallet that it is clear.[Table: 45] The verse AH.And on this direction, the piety of the extent of the virtues of the individuals of the type, and there is no concept for it, as it is only from the different types of evidence or denial, and he said: They said: Let us kill the free servant and mention the female.And that was located in a fight between two lives from the supporters, and this is not proven by this one who narrated it, and it is not enriched in the establishment of the verse, and on these two of the two of the two, there is no one.Limited; Because the condition of his advertisement is not not to appear for the remembrance of the old, because it is unable A sign in the verse that the freedom should not be killed with a servant or a female with a remembrance, and on the contrary of that, and the evidence of equality between the female and the male and the nomadic of the Lord of the Lord and the one who is the one who is from the authority Equality is an extension of other evidence.The third: It was transmitted from Ibn Abbas: that this was a judgment in the chest of Islam, then we copied the verse of the master.Al -Masib, Al -Nakha’i, Al -Tuari, and Abu Hanifa, and Ibn Attiyah and Al -Qaribi narrated that the verse of the extended is a story about the children of Israel, so how can it be a good.The project of Islam, that is: even the saying that those before our jurisprudence are a law for us, so his life is what he did not come on our part of our disagreement.And Ibn Al -Arabi said in the rulings on the Hanafi: His saying is the Almighty “in the killing” is the end of the words, and his saying: The free one came after that, and it was done after that.You have been written in the killing because the killing is general, and the last of the last verse is not invalidated In detail, if it is not intended, and that the words are in his shame, the private specializes in the year, not a referral, and that there is no seen from the adoption of the universe of it.That is, such as the representative, and the one who is transmitted from Hanafi in the scouts is what we mentioned in the nose.And after the interpretation of the interpretation, there is a question that is based on the face of the female after his saying Exalted: The free and the servant with the servant, and does the female come out of its universe or a nation after what it turns out that what is meant by the free and the slave; The form of the male is not in it to be excluded from the women from them; The “p” (p-139) when the name of a gender was released by the rule of gender and the hero of what is in it from the form of a singing, as it is in the form of the form of it.For the sake of this forms, I asked the new science, may God have mercy on him, on the face of the coming of this unpopular interviewer, not to be made from the sects, except for the sake of the loyalty.So he left me with his steadfastness in what comes in it: the phenomenon, and God Almighty knows that the verse means the verse of Surah Al -Maradah For the Islamic law, and for that, the ruling is included in the memorial breath of the masculinity and the female, the free and the servant, the young, the one who is the old Judgment for the slaves or for females, and it was released with his saying: We wrote to them in it [Al -Ma’idah: 45] and the second verse “means the verse of the cow” (He wrote to you) and the rule in it is the freedom that is informed of all kinds, then the ruling of the slave and the females mentioned to whom he does not The female in the female to the sign is that its blood is infallible, and that is because if it is made for it from the female, and it is not made for it from the male, the blood became an infallible to the one The last, and this is from the kindness of the Tablig, where the judgment was joined by its evidence, so he said: ؎ It means that the verse was not intended from it except the heroes of what the ignorant matter had to be left to leave for an honor or a few legacy, so I intended the argument: And the servant of the servant, that is: there is no virtue of a mourning freedom on a weak free, nor the slave of the masters of the slaves of the public, and I intend the one who mentioned the female, the absence The one who is in addition to the female’s female, and its advertisement is not taken from its inflictions, and he wanted to say it: an ignorant wisdom that it is not ongoing on the rulings of Islam; Because the house is for Omar ibn Abi Rabiaa, and he is an Islamic poet from the chest of the Umayyad state.If you say: the face was not to say: (by the female) who feels that the female is not killed by the man with the gathering of Muslims that the woman is from it.I said: Al -Zahir is that the restriction came out of the prevalence of the majority.The majority of the prevailing, as a way out and the description of the fasting person in the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “In the fasting sheep Zakat,” and the abandonment that the verse does not insult from it the meaning of a premium The forms are only the meaning of the will between the categories of the integrity of the ignorance of the ignorance.(P-140) And if it is decided that the verse is not indicative of the negation of the penalty between the different items, nor to prove it from the side of what was mentioned on all of you from the one who is in order Other, so I am saying that his saying: the free and the servant with the servant and the female in the female who is his pregnant who is not doubted in it is the equality of the individuals of all the people A different between the individuals, and then the evidence of the scholars in the leveling of the penalties between some varieties with some, the remembrance of the females, and in its numbers as a long time They do not settle between their two sins, a disagreement of the father of Hanifa, Al -Tuari, and Ibn Abi Lali and Dawad - Another evidence other than this restriction that is in the appearance of the verse, In general, his saying: “The killing” was not proven to him, and he was not excluded from him except the penalty between the Muslim and the warl -by, and his righteousness, and he did not Al -Harbi is not the infallibility of blood, and the instances are in the ruling of killing the Muslim who is a doctrine, and the Shafi’i and Ahmad are exhausted from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one With the hadith, “A Muslim is not killed with a disbeliever”, and the king and the one who said: There is no penalty from the Muslim if he kills the dhimidi and the profession, killing an aggression, and established it.As for the retribution between the free and the servant in the category of the frames, it is not from the attachments of this verse, and it will come when it is the Almighty saying: (And al -Jaruh al -Qasab [Al -Ma’idah: 45] Malik, Al -Shafi’i, and Hamad Al -Qasab, denied the free to the servant, as a result of the work of the creative and the shadows and the silence of the companions, and a call to the terrible monuments, and a measuction of the one who is in the vastness The injury of the custodian of the slave is the same as the memorization.And the reinforcement of the servant to kill him with the free one of them with the gravity, and the penalty of the male to kill the female, fixed with the melody of the discourse.* * * Whoever pardoned him from his brother is something that is followed by the well -known and a performance to him with charity, that is a reduced from your Lord and the mercy of fulfillment to exclusively the luxury; That is, for the extermination of the righteous formula, not to exclusively, what the sentence offered to it is included in it on the fact that it is included in what it is done, and it is not accepted.The guardian of the vulnerability that is used from the pictures of you, the penalty is written on you, but it is not obligatory for it, but it is a right for it, and only it is not.That the taking of it is obligatory for the one who is dead, and the confrontation is to save the remembrance of this after the remembrance of the right to the right.Because of the fact that the first people accept the reconciliation of the success of the brother (P-141) Islam.Al -Azhari said: This is a problematic verse, and it has been interpreted as an interpretation that brought it closer to the destiny of the people What did not reveal a means and still are forms, and for those who have a large number of interpretations, the interpretation of the Qarbi was five of them, and he mentioned in the scout, and he mentioned in the scout, Al -Taybi mentioned two followers of two backs to the interpretation of the scouts, and all of them agreed that the intention is that it is desirable in the reconciliation of the blood, and we are not.The view is anchor, for the separation saying is that we say: The authenticity of “who“ in his saying: So whoever is forgiven for him is the guardian of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the brother of his brother, Remembering the brothers of Islam, and a way for the soul of the murderer; Because if the killer considers a brother to him, he would be from the mirror, not to be satisfied with the leadership of him; Because he who was satisfied with the killing of his brother, and some Arabs said, his brother killed his son with a baptism, so he came to him to strive for him, and he said: Holding and comforting one of my hands that struck me, and you did not want them as a successor from his friend ∗∗∗ This is my brother when they called him, and that is my son and what is true (something) is the ritual of the good “Something” is a name that is overwhelmed in denial, indicating the type of what is reconciled to him, the leg of the words, and the goodness of the words of the word “thing” may be presented.” Let us give you something of fear and hunger [Al -Baqarah: 155], and the meaning of his pardon from his brother was that he gave pardon; That is, the murderer is a murderer from the righteousness of the reconciliation.Among the suffering of the pardon is that it is the affliction of the money that is not crawled by his hearts, and the forgiveness was interpreted by it from the words of the Almighty: (Take the pardon [Al -A'raf: 199]) Because it is authorized to take into account the sponsorship of the teach and the tolerance, and it is the creation of Islam, so this is a certainty of the desire for which he said: (From his brother)) Something; Because the compensation is different, it may be exposed to the blood of blood from gold or silver, and it may be exposed to it, and the debris, or the weapon of blood between it.As the rhythm is not to kill the baptism, as it is in the blood of killing the mistake.And (followers) and (performance) are a summary of two actions, and the estimation: let him follow a follower and to perform a performance, so he refrained from setting up to the one who is already.Raising to benefit the meaning of steadfastness, and investigating the fatal sentence, as he adjusted to raise in his saying: (He said peace [Hood: 69]) 69) The illumination of the source, which was originally made, is divorced to his destiny, with a mourning when he said: (Al -Hamad): A follower of those who are forgiven by his brother, something and a performance (P-142), who have obtained from his brother to him, and in this this is a movement for those who forgive him on him to accept what he has to do with him Perform what he made with goodness.The follower is used in acceptance and satisfaction; That is, let him be satisfied with what he has pardoned for him as the saying One of you is a mill, so it is followed.” From the easy reconciliation, to perform the chain of reconciliation of what it has done without a delay or a deficiency, and the guarantee that is bound by the blame and the guarantee of the mourning for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a pardon.And the intensity of the verse is desirable to consent to the bloodshed of the dead, to change the murderer, to change the people of the ignorance, in which the people of the ignorance are in the authority of the ignorance, And they prepare it with the sales of their birth, as the time of Al -Fakhsi said: “Do not take a mind from the people.They did not accept it from a murderer: ؎ So that they would accept money in a ransom ∗∗∗ We have been given a merit of money in a good way.So they chose to the Damma milk, and this is all in pardoning the killing of the baptism, and the killing of the mistake is that the religion is from the sake of the murderer, and it will come.The brother is similar in the religion of Islam, the foundation of the origin of the Qur’an in which he made the arrests in the contract, such as arrests in the proportions of the brother Puritanity, and the agreement in the proportions is a human being.The killer named the brother of the blood of blood, and that is the brother of Islam with the unprepared killers.From what the souls are easy for, and do not deny it and do not deny it, and it is said to him as a denial, and he will come when he said: You were the best of the mother of the mother You are commanded by the well-being, and you are forbidden by Al-Munazar [Al-Imran: 110] For the known; He is attached to his saying: (To him) who is authorized to pray to him and give to him to reference to the notification of the money of the sacrifice to the one who does not go to him and does not go to him.With himself for his arrest, or to send those who hold him, and in it a sign that he does not stretch it, and that increased a report with his saying: (with goodness), meaning: Popular.Its saying: that is a relief from your Lord, a sign of the referee, which is the acceptance of forgiveness and the charity of performance and the enemies of the penalty That is, the effect of its mercy; Taking a scraps is just, and the pardon is mercy.And when the entrepreneurship was sufficient to achieve the purpose of the law on the basis of the score of people from the killing of the souls and the achievement of the sake of the sake of the right The good for the guardian, the permission was in forgiveness if it is for him - a mercy from God with two sides, for justice is presented and the mercy comes after it.It was said: The verse referred to what was in the project of the Israeli project from the awareness of the vigor from the murderer of the baptism without pardon and without the religion, as it was mentioned by many of the people, and it is in the authority Al -Bukhari, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, and he is the back of what is in the travel of the third chapter: So I make you a place that will be hired to it, and if a human being abandoned on his owner to kill him with a treachery, then he is at the time of my sacrifice, and he takes it to the dead.) Pardon is divorced, and it is clear that this is not fixed in the project of Jesus; Because he did not tell God about him, but he said, and for you, some of whom were forbidden to you [Al -Imran: 50], so perhaps what he took from the scholars of Al -Masih, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the command of the command.A judgment that the bones of God will be removed from him to survive until the world’s system, and a scaling between the condition of the perpetrator by killing in Islam, he signs the vastness of the people, and he will fall in the vastness of his life.The one who is killed, does not know what to accept the reconciliation or does not accept it, and between what was if it was confident that it is not attributed to it, for that it will be removed from it.* * * (P-144) Whoever takes care of after that, has a torment that is separated from the ruling of forgiveness; Because pardon requires the thanks of God on the direction of the permissibility of forgiveness, and that the guardian was harnessed to the pardon, and from the thanks not to return to the time A painful torment, and the fans were pleased with the painful torment of the torment of the hereafter, and what is meant is the stretching of the torment on him as his saying: He is the one who returns to him: The judgment of the pardon and the religion is what the fighting is in them, and it was interpreted by some of them with the torment of the world; I mean the killing, and they said: If the pierced returns to the killing once, then it is imperative to kill him, and the ruler can not be able to pardon Al -Saddi, and it was narrated by Abu Dawood, on the authority of Samara ibn Jundab, on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ, and it was narrated from Omar ibn Abd al -Aziz that it is a miracle to the struggle of the imam, Their sayings are here, whether the torment is the torment of the hereafter or the torment of the world - that the confirmation of crocodiles is required to be overburdened, and it is a phenomenon of the streets of the street; Because crocodiles have become a deer, so he reaped him to kill the soul, and he is authorized to be his dehydration with the soul, so he must be comfortable with the people, With it, it is not that this does not prevent the judgment of pardon if the guardian is satisfied with it; Because the truth is its right, and the best of the saying of Omar ibn Abd al -Aziz is to whitening it to the imam to look at this killer, it is a matter of breath Aqdah is tightened by more than one hundred and general love, even if they did not say it; Because the remembrance of God, this judgment, after the remembrance of the mercy is indicated that this side is not very serious in his bitter, with the more mercy, and this is the one who is a long time The man in the ignorance was killed and then pushed the religion and then he would be gone to the blood and he would kill him, and he is close to this story of Hasan bin Zaddah With his saying: ؎ For my life to the blessings of the neighborhood, they have been restricted to them with what they do not have a fortress.
