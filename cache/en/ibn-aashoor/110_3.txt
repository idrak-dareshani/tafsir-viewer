The Quranic researcher was that it was a cessation of all the preceding words and an extension of what is required to explain in it from the matter by seeking forgiveness from his Lord with the goodness of the good You will see you.And a watery: an example of a release of his repentance.The action of the repentant of the one with a rhythm (Ali) is called in the sense of success for the repentance, which is proven in the tongue and the dictionary, and this release is especially for what is not.The sentence has been completed on four confirmations: that, and, and the form of exaggeration in the repentance, and the intention of the exaltation in it.And where the confirmation of (that) is not what is intended with it, the response and the removal of the frequency, as it is not overwhelmed in the side of the address I confirm it.It has been decided that from the time (that) if it comes to this direction that you sing the singing of the fulfillment of the rituals and the causes and the extermination of the explanation and the ritual of the words of what the words of what is before it Once upon a time, he was presented, from it when he said: You are the wise knowledge [Al -Baqarah: 32] in Surah Al -Qarra, so the meaning is: it is the acceptance of the acceptance of the slander Bey.And if the words were diverted and analogy with the previous words, it is appointed to be attached to (tawab), and it is appreciated by the two repentances.This estimated is intended by the general, and it is general (P-597), which is specialized in walking, which is allocated by evidence and description With forgiveness, he stated that if he seeks forgiveness, he will be forgiven, a sign that it is required to follow the paths, then this sentence benefited the matter of the matter of the matter of the matter.Because seeking forgiveness is the request of forgiveness, the student sees the answer of his request, and as for the sentence of the matter with praise and praise, he does not need to be done; Because they create a hoax and a blessing of God.From that, the sentence benefited a sign of the goodness of the acceptance of the acceptance of God, when it is presented to the world, and this is the meaning of a vial; Because whoever is known as the acceptance of the repentance of the repentance is that he will be honored and the beneficiaries who have ended in their faces in the illness Due to the knowledge of the wedding.Because it is ended with what the loved ones are afraid of the rhetoric of the blame, the people are that it is a repentant that it requires that it is not afraid of reproach.This sentence is with its sweeping signs and its Kinnary or the metaphor, and its followers are an illusion of what the sentence that is accepted by the one who is before it is from the one who is before it It is appropriate for it to be praised by praise and praise by their advertising, as a result of the matter of seeking forgiveness, as it is presented as a nose who does not need to be done, He has them on their own, but they are adopting their being a symbol of the condemnation of the death of the Messenger of God ﷺ that is what is in his saying: It was a tiredness The promise of the good acceptance of their domains, and the matter is the matter of forgiveness, the appropriateness His optimal and entrepreneurial meanings, meaning that it is accepted by seeking forgiveness and accepting you with the best acceptance, when he became a covenant of forgiveness and honor.And the work here was used in the meaning of the meaning of descriptions in the past time, which is that this description is subject to it that does not succeed his work from his servants of his servants The Qur’an on the news of God about its soul with that of the principle of creation.It is necessary to say that he was a forgiveness, as in a verse, I said, forgive your Lord, that he was a forgiveness [Noah: 10], and the description will run on what is appropriate for him) So he changed from that to be shed with the Prophet ﷺ that his command is with forgiveness, it is not required to prove his sin for him, because you knew that he was a row that came to him) It is used in the sense of his success (P-598) for the kindness of gesture until his command is to seek forgiveness of guidance to the place of discipline with God, so he does not ask for a blind He preferred him with what he has explained to him, and because he described (tab) is more intense to establish the faction with a separation (wraps);
