The researcher, when Abraham said, Lord.The fire and the misery of the destiny is a kind of kindness, and when we made the house a reward for the benefit of a third vengeance for the Abraham, peace be upon him, in the admiration of his prayers, and the reason for his pretext I will give it to her if they thank you, and a alert is a third for my partner, Mecca, on the day, so that they can remember the call of their father, Abraham.The last until he specialized from his offspring, with his believers.That is a source of them for the equity, because people have a desire to feed on their predecessors and two to their conditions For the Abrahams, and from the life of the mosque, the ritual of the pilgrimage, the pilgrims are not enriched by them from the ritual of God He forced him to the torment of fire and the misery of the destiny, and with it the appearance of the male of this vengeance is the punishment of his saying, and when we made the house a ritual and a ritual: 125] Referring to his saying, “This is a country” intended by the position that is based on him, the deprivation of his prayers, and it is the place that he made his wife and his son, and his son is the same.Before the construction, or the one in which the kaab was built if the supplication is after the construction, then the embrace of the self is sinful from the sensual signal (p-714) that is the same (P-714).The addressee is a sinner from the reference to it, so the release of the reference is then clear.The origin of the reference is that it seeks to seek the increase in the indication of the indication of two disclosure, because the indication is that they are increasing the signal, and they will increase the sign of the sign.A name is raised by the kindness of Bayan or an extension of the name of the sign for the indication that the referred to it is the intention of his briefing from some of his descriptions as saying: This is the one who says: That is if you leave the sign with the child in accordance with the presence of what is meant by the name of the sign.And there was amending here from the extent of the referred to him, and it is sufficient for him to be a summary of the supplication, because Abraham called his call and he was in the place that was built in which he is the one who is the one who is the one in which he is the one who is the one in which he is the one who is the one in which he is the one who is the one in which he is the one who is the one in which he is the one who is the one in which he was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one in which he is the same The detail of the supplication is the case, but it is the admiration of its supplication and the virtue of the place of supplication and made the Mecca of a safe country and the provision of its people from the fruits, and that is the same, and that is the same, and that is the same, and that is the same He was attached to it in the mind that you did not see that when he made the country a second one, he used to seek the name of the name of the reference, and in Surah Ibrahim, when he made it a second one.With the memorial The country, he obtained from the two verses that Abraham called a country to be safe.The stable country from the sacrifice is a general or a gossip, and it is also the earthly divorced.So he sacrificed the eggs of the country, he wants the egg of the cattle in the ears of the cattle, that is, the place of its eggs, and the country is called the village that is formed from the homes of it.A true launch is more famous than the country on the wide earth and the appearance that the invitation of Abraham the storyteller in this verse was before it was before It was only for it to be a house, or a house, or the last two, because Abraham started his practice with the people of the house from a stone, and because God is not for him, for God is for it to God, for God is for it to God.The profession of the civilization of that side is an excuse for the prophecy of our master Muhammad ﷺ, and it is necessary that that place was due to the residents and the coming of his father, They remember that in that side there are raids of their air, dots, and the custodians, and the cherries in the flaws of ray and norms.Security is an active name from the security of a fearful, and it is when they are released by the number of fear from an enemy and from a fight, and that is what God has distinguished from it The number of fear is divorced, so the male (P-715) is attached to it, but it is described as security that is correct to be fair to the fear, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same By making the weight of an active here for the proportions in the sense of security, such as the saying of the naps, the whole of me is for me, O Mamiya, who is a staple, or on the authority of the sake of God The mental metaphor for the place of the place, then if the referred to it is at the time of the supplication of Abraham, in which there is a house or a house.The estimation in the words make this place a safe country, that is, a safe village, so it will be a supplication that it becomes a village and be safe.And if the referred to him at the time of his prayers is a village that is people around it, and they went down, and it is the appearance that the words of the scouts feel here, and in the Surah of Buri With the crime of security for him, and the story of his call in Surah Ibrahim, with his saying, make this country safe [Ibrahim: 35], so that he has a call for him.And the call of Ibrahim, this is the same as the word of the prophethood, for the country's security and the paths follow all the characteristics of the happiness of life, and it is not the same The security of its body, and it follows the perpetrator and the acceptance of what is beneficial and the ritual, then the security does not disagree unless the three are dispersed: the first, and if the first is dispensed, then the brother is dispersed, The residence is in it on its inhabitants to increase and the means of what he wanted for that country from his being, as well as Islam.And the actions are collected A thickness, which is what the tree is carried out with, and it is directed from what is in it a food for a person or a fruit for him, and as if his name is based on the name of the fruit, then the ritual of the ritual By the fruits of the wet pass and the domination of Japan.The fruit has a pluralism, and it is a fruit with investigations, and a fruit, and two guilt, two sins, and a third of them.And Aamim.And the definition in the fruits is the definition of the expression, and it is a customs of the knowledge of any of all the well -known fruits for people and the evidence of its universe is the definition To blame, and in this supplication to them with the sponsorship, so that their souls are not forgiven to the ritual of it.And the saying of whom he believes in God, with some of his saying, “His family,” benefits his specialization because his family is general, as it is the name of added collection and the exaltation of some.(P-716) The Imam of the believers specialized in demanding the provision of them, as they are keen on the guidance of faith for his poor, because if they knew that the call of the sake of the believer is not.He neutralized them from faith, so he made the livelihood to them on the condition of their faith, sending them to faith, or he wanted to discipline with God, and he asked him to ask him He felt from the response of God to him, the precedent of his predecessor, when he said: And from my offspring, he said: He does not obtain the covenant of the oppressors [Al -Baqarah: 124] that there is no other May God bless them, and God has followed his call by his saying and whoever disbelieves, so he enjoined him a little The causes of the residence in it, so the pilgrim does not compel them to the silence of another country because it is hoped that they would be preachers of what the kaab was built for the sake of the sake of the residence The Hanafi is the characteristics of the Khamal, and this is the first to be the formation of the virtuous city that called the Plato to find after a period of ten centuries.And a sentence said, and whoever disbelieves, his enjoyment came to the Sunnah of the story of the sayings in the vocabulary and the domains, separated, and a destiny said to God, so whoever is in the authority of God, who said: For the Abraham, and that the return of the saying to the prolongation of the first saying, he has forgiven the meaning, about the recovery, and the annexation in his saying, “So he used it.” And his saying, “And whoever disbelieves“ the appearance is that he is a kind of sentence ”and provides his family,“ by administering the restriction, and he said it ”whoever believes in“ then he will say to him ” The communication is the meaning of the condition, so that the news of the news of the fulfillment of a great way is like it, because what we presented in his saying “and from the offspring of my God:” 124] The creation, if it was an authenticity of the one who was confused with the creation, was an indication of the extent of the incursion and the leaders He showed his virtue over Ibrahim that he provides his atoms of their believer and their disbelievers, or he appeared with the capacity And their infidels.And the meaning of “its enjoyment” is the provision of the livelihood for him, and a “liquidation” for a minorly export after his saying, “So his enjoyment“ and the goods of the lord of the lord of the lord.The interviewer indicated that he said, then he was forced to the torment of the fire and in this verse a sign of the saying of Al -Baqalani and the mortal and the one who is the one who is unbeliever The blessings of the world, and Al-Ash'ari said that it was not blessed on the infidel, neither in the world nor in the last, but God gave them in (P-717) the world is a pleasure on the face of the picnic, and the one is in the face The issues of the dispute between Al -Ash'ari and Al -Mataradi, and it is likened that the dispute be between them, and it is a cursing in the meantime.And his saying, then he forced him to the torment of the fire, is that the infidel is overwhelmed by the fact that the blessing in the world is forbidden, so the satisfaction of God is forbidden.(Then) For the arrogance of the arrogance, as it was in the kindness of the sentence, from the end of the fools to the time of its destiny to the torment, delayed from its death in the lunch.And the persecutions in the origin of the resurrection, and it is a decoration.The recovery came to his transgression to a verb, and it is an exploration of eloquent, and it is not running on a measure that is said to be forced to do so, that is, he resorted to him, and we are in this way.The Surah of Lamman, whose enjoyment is a little, then we are obliged to a thick torment [Luqman: 24] and his saying and the misery of the destiny is a tuning and the waw for the paths or for the state and the solution The one who is devoted to vilification and its estimation is.
