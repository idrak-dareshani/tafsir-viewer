The researcher of the Qur’an costs a soul, except for it for it, for what it has earned, and on it what the appearance has gained is that it is from the words of God Almighty, not from the story of the words of the Messenger and the believers The rulings of the saying, and its benefits are the protrusion of the fruit of faith, peace, and obedience, so God knows them that he did not make them in this religion A hardship, and with that, it is taught by admiration for their inhabitants, or whom they are inspired: and it is our Lord, we do not take us if we forget us to say: They tell their calls for that.It is permissible to be from the words of the Messenger and the believers, as if it is an illusion of their saying that we heard and obeyed us [Al -Baqarah: 285], meaning: our knowledge is what we say to us.It is yourselves or hide it [Al -Baqarah: 284] that it enters it from the stinging in the expansion, from what I have shown and what was hidden, which appears to him a trace in the outside of the one who is the one who is a choice, or the one who is a choice, And he reassures him, except that his saying: It has what it has earned, etc.(P-135) He did that it is from the words of God.He said: “When you have come down, and if you appear, what is in your soul or hide it, God will hold you with God.[Al -Baqarah: 284] They said: We heard, obeyed and greeted us, so God gave faith in their hearts, and when they did that, God Almighty has transcended it, and he will be revealed: God does not cost it to be.On this, a binding for the strategy, and the intended to be drawn and specialization; Because the soul is reassured by the soul: that these verses are followed by the system, and with that it is permissible for you to be desirable, so it is a journey, so it is a junction, so it is a journey, so it is a matter of what it is.Some Muslims are embarrassed.And the “expansion” in the Qur’an is to be guaranteed, and it is in the words of the Arabs like the waw, which is the energy and the obedience, and what is meant by it is what is unbearable and obedient, so it is from the release of the source, And the deduction is what people are accustomed to their ability to do it if their wills are directed to do it with peace and the consequences of obstacles.This is an indication of the vicinity of the mandate, according to the energy in the condemnation of God, the Almighty (Pass) in the Nafi, because God is up to the Almighty, and the exalted The conditions of creation, so they do not cost them what they do not like to do, and what is mentioned of that is in the context of the punishment, and this is a general judgment in all of them.The project of Islam was distinguished by the secret and the companion, with the testimony of his words, the Almighty: and what made you in religion from embarrassment [Hajj: 78] and his saying: God wants you and does not want you [Al -Baqarah: 185] And that was a barrier Public jurisprudence: the hardships of the teaser, and the hardships were the suspicion of the privilege, and the exaltation of the slave of the worshipers, the slave of the prayer, and the slander of the prayer, The saying in it in my name is (the purposes of the project) and what was mentioned in the hard cloggedness, a brilliant matter, in the lattice of the deportation, as the mandate of the one of the Muslims.For the twenty -one of the first of Islam and the few Muslims.This question is the one in the books of the two of the two of the two, with the negative aspiration of the transfer, and the abuse of what is unbearable, and it is a question that I seek the book of the book, In it, in it (P-136), a martyr who called for the commitment of the two parties to the parallel, their origins and their barriers, so the Ash'ari said: It is permissible for God to do what is not able They are in the denial of the ritual of the righteousness of God, and that what is issued by all of it is just because it is the possession of worshipers, and I have the right to what he is up to the one who creates what he creates That the dignity of the cost is not eaten by the purpose of compliance, but it may be the intention of irritation and the abuse and make the compliance a mark on the happiness of the happiness The righteousness and the arrangement of the richness, because God has the Almighty to reward the disobedient, and torture the obedience, so the first is the torment of those who command him with an impartial act, and you will be excused, With the hadith of the depictive of the photographer by blowing the soul in the image and what is blown, and the cost of the liar in the vision of the contract between two rituals, and what is in the verb, and there is no effect, and it is not in this The hereafter, and because they are an authentic news that does not prove the same as the origins of religion.The disgrace said: It is not possible to learn with the unbearable of their rule in their rule that it is obligatory for God to do the righteousness and deny the injustice of it, The deeds are from the verbs, and their rule is that the virginity is the compliance, otherwise it is in vain while it is imprisoned for God, and that God will be exalted.And infer this verse and the verses indicating their origins, like the one and the injustice of your Lord no one [the cave: 49] and what we were tortured until we are the one who is a messenger: [15] He is commanded to be broken [Al -A'raf: 28] etc.And the verification is that the one who has been in the case in the question is the view in the creation of the actions of worshipers, because Al -Ash'ari denied the power of the servant, and he said with the sake The servant is to obtain the destiny without the power to be influenced by it, in which the disgraceful obligation is the saying that God is the right of the servants of what is the worshiper of what is in Approximation in the inherent, so the Ash'ari adherence is that, and the imam of the sacred, the gazelle, and the Ash'ari in the permissibility of the inconvenience of what is unbearable, and the verse do not rise to the argument of the words Can this.Then it was closed The permitted: Is it fall, and the mutiopi narrated the consensus on the numbers of the struggles, and it is the right thing in the story, and the imam of the two sacreds said in Al -Barahan: and all of them are all of them.Unbearable; Because the rituals are all attached to action, which is when Al-Ash'ari is not possible for the cost, so it is commanded by the prayer, and it is not valid, Humanity at the will of the act with the peace of the reasons and machines.And what the Imam of Al -Hariman Al -Ash'ari is obligated to have a false commitment; Because what is meant by the unbearable of what is not attached to the destiny of the phenomenon, which is expressed by the loss, for the difference between the apparent conditions, and between the phenomena, and between the phenomenon, and between the dahd The same thing, and therefore there is no meaning to enter what God has known for the soul of his fall, as the matter of my father is ignorant of faith with the knowledge of God, that he does not believe, With the transfer, because the knowledge of God was not informed of him, and it was reported to him that the Prophet ﷺ called the father of a flame to Islam and God has not known to God: My father is a flame and a fool [Al -Masad: 1] to his saying: He will pray with a flame of flame [Al -Masad: 3] It is said: After this is the coming of this verse, it was not addressed to the request of faith Thus, we are grateful to say: It is outside the supplication and from what we say: He is addressed after the revelation of the verse.This verse requires the number of expulsion in the unbearable in the project, according to the compatible in the will of the humanity and their ability, without what is in the sense of the sacrament The realization of the urban destiny, yes, the response is taken from the album And his saying: It has what has earned it, and it has not given up a state of “soul” by the way of how the expansion, which was assigned to the soul: that if it came to it, then it came to it.Bashir was harmful to it, and this division is of attachment to the medium (the lam) again and with a medium (on), and (and (it was caught and was given), and it was written) The Arabs, because the one who is filled with (acknowledge) is not at its door, but it was crossed again by (captain) and was delayed by (ahead), softening it, and it is a return to the return of the word.The tumor in his saying: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ First of all the most famous, then it was restored with its obedience, and it may be in the choice of the verb, which is its origin, indicating the eagerness, indicating that the evil is that the evil So the soul continues the soul and its abundance, and that is anxious about God for people in sins, and the choice of the verb indicating the choice of the soul for the goodness of the soul, that the goodness of the soul is that To the people of the fungus, and it was located in the scout that it was action Its eagerness to the domain of the nations, and the evil was inspired by the soul, so it is found in its acquisition, so he expressed its action with this.And what is meant by (what you gained) is the evil, for the sake of that is the thought of some of the interpreters that the gain is the purpose of good, and the acquisition is the purpose of evil, and it is the disagreement of the In the Qur’an, and every soul is not covered except upon it [Al -Anam: 164] - Then it was said to those who have been wronged.It was said: If it is gathered with (a casual), it is specially specialized in the work in which it costs, but he did not want to express (the one) in the side of the good.In this verse, it is a good thing for the father of the good, the Ash'ari in its name, the obedience of the servant as an increase and acquisition; For God has described himself as destiny and did not describe the worshipers as destiny, and I did not support them, so he did.It is fulfilled by achieving the addition of actions to worshipers, with literature in the number of proof of the capacity of the power to worship, and it was said: The first of those who use the word of the sake is the word The carpentry, the head of the Najari team, from al -Jabriyah, and was a contemporary of the system in the third century, but he was defamed by the father of the good of the good.Al -Khani: More than the causation of Ash'ari.And the definition of the gain at Al -Ash'ari: It is the case of the servant whose creation of God is a verb related to it, and the Razi Imam defined it with the righteousness of the righteousness.Coop in the capacity of God and to gain the same as the other.And he obtained the meaning of the gain and what they called for its proof is that when it was decided that God is ahead of all the uniforms that are outside the choice of the servant, it is necessary to decide the uncle of the world Like the ability of God, it is not uncomfortable with some of the nations, a tank for the evidence indicating that God is on all things, and that it is a matter This evidence is a sign that it is devoted to, so it is obligatory for this general.The persecution verbs such as the refreshing movement, the optional acts, (P-139) as the movement of livestock and the killer, and sponsoring the right of the jurisprudence of the law of the law The depression is a vastness and the truth of the promise and the backward, so that they will not be void, and it is necessary for the servant to be a condition that enables it to be done by what he wants, and what he wants is what he wants, and what he wants, He left it, and it is his mile to the verb or the blessing, for this situation is the name of Ash'ari, the obedience, and he called it an estrangement, and he said: It is related to the verb, then it is commented The verb that he tended to the image that he brought up and tired of it.And the two gossip in the verse: for the purpose of the sealing.That is, something other than it does not follow anything, and it does not have anything other than the act of it, and as if this is the heroes of what they were in the ignorance: from the perpetrator of the God of the god.And he grabbed this verse whoever sees that the works do not accept the clothes in the reward and punishment, unless the action has an effect in the work other than it, then in the hadith, “If the son of the son dies from Three: A running charity, and a science that broadcasts it in the breasts of men, and a righteous child who calls for him.Because he is the first to be the age of killing.To the Day of Resurrection.” * * * Our Lord does not take us if we forget or make our Lord, and do not carry us as a good as you carried it to those before our Lord, and do not carry what we have no energy for us, We have mercy on us, and we will be victorious to the infidels.It is permissible for this supplication to be a saying from the saying of the believers who said: We heard and obeyed us [Al -Baqarah: 285] that they followed the acceptance and the satisfaction, so they will be satisfied, so they will be satisfied, so they went to.Humanity, and the choice of this story about them in the last of the surahs is a complement to the permission to end it, and it is permissible for you to be met by God, the Almighty, that this is what they are.They were codified in the Fateh Surah, so the pbuin) will be the ability: Say: Our Lord does not take us to the last of the surah, that God is then that he has not decided Its expansion, to give them a survivor with calls, which are the effects of the abandonment of the cost, which is not in the expansion, and what is meant by the supplication is that the permanence is required for that, so that there is no one who is not.As he was angry at those who said: So he was angry with those who have forbidden us with good women who were resolved for them [Women: 160].And the delay is derived from taking the meaning of the rationale, as his saying: Likewise, I take your Lord if he takes the villages while they are unjust [Hood: 102] and the effect is in it for the sake For forgetting and sin.What is meant is what is arranged by the forgetfulness and the sin of action or leaving that does not satisfy God Almighty.This is a call from the believers, and they called it before they know that God raised them from that with his saying: God does not cost a soul, but the soul of it is the same.“My mother’s mistake and the forgetfulness were lifted and what they are in order to“ and in a narration.Ahmad, and it is correct, unlike what refers to the discourse of the place, so the meaning, God raised them from them.And the impresses, and for that came in this supplication, do not take us, that is: do not take us with punishment for action: forgetfulness or mistake, so the forms of the supplication do not want to do so We need the interpretation of the verse by the fact that what is meant by forgetting and mistakes is because of the discharge and the omission as in the scouts.And his saying: Our Lord, and do not carry us with an insult, etc.The call, but it is intended to restore the clearance of the humiliation, and the bearing is metaphor in the seizure of a severe matter that is burdening the soul, and it is a suitable for the rule of assets.And the origin of the meaning of the insult is what is confined to it, that is, it is bound, and the things are held with it, and it is said to him: The wasting - by breaking the ham The one who is in it, and it is his saying in the family of Umar: Al-Zajaj and Al-Zamakhshari here and in his saying, in (P-141) Surah Al-Araf: And they put them from them.Because the bearing is appropriate for the heavy, so it is its saying and does not carry a sloppy nomination for the fathers of the likeness of it and from the son of Abbas, and do not carry it to us.We are tormented by killing and breaking it.And his saying: As you carried it on those who were before us, a row of “ahead”, meaning: a covenant of religion, like the covenant, which he assigned to those who came before us in the hardship, The last nations of the hard rulings like the sons of the children of the sons of the sons that are four years, and with adolescents in the cow who were commanded by its sacrifice, is a brightness, and all of you They have violations, and for a few, he walked up with the sans of God and His Messenger to them, he said in the attribute of Muhammad ﷺ and put them from them [Al -A'raf: 157].And his saying: Our Lord, and do not carry us what is not energy for us, that is, what we do not can be pregnant from the sanctuaries, and the weakness is in it for preparedness, and it was said: This is a supplication The hardship, which is before it a supplication with their recovery from the punishment that the nations were punished, and the energy in the origin of the enemy was reduced by the deletion of the gossip, as they said: And obedience.And the saying in these two prayers is like saying in his saying, our Lord, do not take us.And his saying: He forgave us and forgive us, and he did not take up with these calls by saying “our Lord”, either because he repeated three times, and the Arab Three times, except in the place of evolution, or because these are the prestigious calls with his saying, “Our Lord” is a terrifying one for this three calls, so if you are answered, then you will be answered.This is the first Relativity, forgiveness is the origin of the raising of hardship, and mercy is the origin of the boundary of the worldly and the other, so when it was a blindness, it was a blindness, as it was One supplication.And his saying: You are a son, so he separated it because it is like the cause of the past calls, that is: we called you and we hope that you are because you are our birth, and from the mind of the Lord And to be this as well as the presentation of the following claim.(P-142) And his saying: So we will be victorious to the unbelieving people in which it is fulfilled by the fulfillment of the separation from his being a loyal The satellite appears in the fall of the satelliteness and al -Ja`siyyah in the words of Bin Uday al -Fakdas With the fulfillment of a certainty, asking for the answer to the supplication with victory, because they made him arranged on a verified description, and he is the guardian of God, the Almighty, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: 257] In the hadith of “One day, when Abu Safyan said: We have the comforter and there is no attribution for you.It is a brilliant call to the good of the world and the hereafter, because if they are insisting on the enemy, then they were good for their lives and their religion appeared, and they gave up the temptation.In Al -Saheeh, on the authority of Abu Masoud Al -Ansari Al -Badiri: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: The Messenger with what was revealed to him from his Lord [Al -Baqarah: 285] to the last of the Surah, it was said: It is with it as enough for the night, and it will be the meaning of those who read it.It was sufficient for him to be blessed and shed from the demons and harms, and perhaps both the two impersonations are intended.* * * (P-143) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of Amr, the name of this is the name of this surah, in the words of the Prophet ﷺ and the words of the companions: Surah, the family of Amr, Abu Imamah: He said: I heard the Messenger of God saying, “Read the two flowers: the cow and the family of Amran.The day of the resurrection is presented by Surah al -Baqara and the family of Amran.A night, and Ibn Abbas called it, in his hadith in Al -Saheeh, he said: “I have a house in the house of the Messenger of God, and the Messenger of God slept even if the half of the night was or the night of the night or the heart of the night or the heart of the night or the heart of the night.He woke up the Messenger of God and read the verses from the last Surah of Amran.And her name is in the wall of the family of Amran, that she was mentioned in it the virtue of the family of Amran, and he is Amran ibn Matan, Abu Maryam, and his family is his wife The rituals of the Prophet, and the Zakaria of Mary, when it was her father Amran died and left her pregnancy, so she sponsored her aunt's husband.And the Messenger of God ﷺ was described by Al -Zahra in the hadith of the Imam al -Muqdid.Al -Alwsi mentioned that it was called safety, treasure and argument, and the Surahs of exploitation.And I did not see it for others, and perhaps it was made of descriptions that this surah was described by what the Qarbibi leg, in the question of the third and the righteous.This surah was descended by the city with the agreement, after the cow wall, so it was said that it is a second for the cow’s wall that the cow is the first of the signs of the light.The city was descended from the coffee, then the cow, then the Surah of Amran descended, then the enforcement came down in a bi -bay It came down before a number of Badr, for the agreement that the flee was descended in (P-144) and a bi-bay The Muslims are a day, and that there is a remembrance of one day, and it is permissible for some to be delayed.And the one mentioned in the causes of the descent, on the authority of the interpreters that the first of this surah is to his saying, and we have Muslims.[Al -Baqarah: 136] The master and the punishment, that is, the age of two of the migration, and from the scholars who said: The Surah of the Amran came down after the wall of the running, and it was descended from the ie Three years, and this is closer, so those who are agreed upon that his saying is up and when you became from your family, the believers are assured of the sake of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been.One.He also said his saying, and there is nothing but a messenger who has been empty before him.The killing of the Prophet ﷺ.It is permissible for the first to be the first after the cow to the end of what refers to it the hadith of Najran, and that is the enemy of the either of the first of the first to the first of it Al -Ahly [Al -Imran: 121] said by Al -Qurtubi at the beginning of the Surah, and in the interpretation of his saying, what was good for God to give him the book [Al -Imran: 79] the verse.The saying may be presented in the chest of Surah Al -Fatihah: We are clear that we can compare a number of lights in a single period, so the meaning of their saying is not: After a surah, such, it is intended that the hostility came down after another that it begins to go down after we go down, but what is meant is that it is the same We have been removed.This is the eighth and forty surahs in the might of the Qur’an.The number of two hundred hundred in the number of the gathering and its number when the numbers of the numbers with the sham is a hundred and nine hundred and sidelines.This surah was included, from the purposes: the appeal of the Qur’an, and Muhammad, and the division The verses of the Qur’an, and the consequences of the understanding in its consequences, and the intensity of the subject of Islam and that it is not a debt of religion, and that a debt is not accepted by God, after God And intending to be grateful and splendid, and gesture that they have been revealed before the Qur’an is a gift to this religion, so it is not necessary for people to disbelieve in it, and to the end of the God Almighty, His individuals, and the abuse of the delusion of those who took the gods without God: Whoever made him (P-145) is a partner, or they took it to him, Done, and not to be deceived by what they are in excess of extermination, and that what was prepared for the believers is better than that, and their guidance in the wanders of their authority, then the praise of God, peace be upon him.And the remembrance of the miracle of its appearance, and that it is a creature of God, the remembrance of those who truly believed in it, and the abuse of the divine of Jesus, and then it is led to the judgment of the authority of the Then the argument of the two books of the two writers in the truth of the Hanafi, and that they are a distance from it, and what God has taken from the era of all the messengers: that they believe in the Lord, A house that was placed for people, and the Handy religion was restored to him as he started in it, and he was obliged to perform Hajj on the believers, and he appeared in the misfortunes of the Juda Their religion, and their faith, what was revealed to them.And the Muslims remembered his blessings upon them, between Islam, and commanded them with union and agreement, and reminded them of the stalls of their bad condition in the ignorance, and they are in the ignorance, They are among the people of the book and the participants, and he reminded them of the warning of their hands and the good of those who appeared Islam and then returned to the infidels, so they were for example, for example.He commanded them to provide themselves with themselves, and the patience is to receive hardships, the elaboration, and the harm of the enemy, and their promise to that of victory and the disbelief, and the meeting of the pupil in them.Then he reminded them of the day, and on the day of a day, and the ideals were beaten for them by what they got in them, and he did not, with the grace of the martyrs of the Muslim, the Muslim, and the command of the Muslims, With the money of money in the consolation of the nation, the charity, the virtue of the work, the leaving the heart, the slave of the usury and the conclusion of the surah with the verses of thinking in the kingdom of God.And you knew that the descent of this surah is a case and the redemption of Najran from the country of Yemen.And Najran is a people who are a people from Najran, with the emission of the prophet ﷺ, and the people of Najran were extended in the Nazraniya, and they are from the truthful of the Arabs, Mashhair, and they resided to the praise of their gossip, which is the one who referred to the east when he praised them with his saying: ؎ With her doors, a ransom of them gathered by the punishment - in which Sixon is a man - and his name is Abd al -Masih, which is The Emir of the Exponation, and the master and his name is the delusional, and it is the garment of the people and the mobilization Al -Bakri, who is their feet and the owner of their studies, and their religion, and the brother of Abi Harethah, and he was not among the people of Najran, but he was the one who was a ritual: And his money.So they met the Prophet ﷺ and ran them in their debt, and in the place of the Christ, when the pilgrimage rose to them, they insisted on their disbelief, and they were called, so they called them, so they called them, so they called them, so they called them.So they answered and then stumbled for that, and gave it up from it, and returned to their homeland, and it came down with a place and a few of this surah in the same thing On the authority of Ibn Ishaq.And this one mentioned that one and the pride, so whoever thinks that the family of the walk is that the redeeming of the rolls of and they ran out in a year of nine, and he was gone to him from the time of the Sunnah.And the consensus is that the Surah of Amran is one of the parents of the civilizations, and it is likely that it was descended in the ransom of Najran, which is known that the redemption of Najran was before the age of the mouth.
