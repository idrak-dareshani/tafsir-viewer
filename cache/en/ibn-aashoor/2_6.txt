registered that their deprivation from the guidance of his guidance, but it was from the time On the authority of that, then what was among those who think about the punishment of their affairs and warn against the bad consequences, so they were not among the righteous, and it was both of them, and it was only for them.يَتَلَقَّوُا الإنْذارَ بِالتَّأمُّلِ بَلْ كانَ سَواءً والعَدَمُ عِنْدَهم,

either for the extension of the fulfillment of the news and its westernism without the response of denial or suspicion; Because the discourse of the Prophet ﷺ and for the nation, which is a rhetoric, where he did not precede a doubt in his fall, and the coming is that a lot of people have a lot in the words, and it is in the words.It may be that here is to return the doubt as an exodus of talking on the contradiction of the oppression; Because the patience of the Prophet ﷺ at the guidance of the disbelievers makes it not to cut off the hope (P-248) in the end of the warning to them and his condition as the one who doubts the excuse of the warning The smoothness of what was done on the book of praise in its bishops, the exclusive grace in the guidance, it is reassured that its gifts are

the communication is to be a destroyed gender of the person who is exaggerated that what is meant by the infidels is the most vulnerable.They do not believe in a year with a sense of sense of the testimony of those who believe in them or be a year that is intended for the peculiarities with the villages, and these are the sacrifices that are the ones who are the ones who are.Those who are

between him and hisor.Among the interpreters of those who carried those who disbelieved in the heads of Jews, like my son, Bin Akhbat and my father, a lifeline, meaning that the surah is in the way of it.The disbelievers are only the Jews and the hypocrites, and this is far from the usual Qur’an and symptoms of the intended context from it, with the remembrance of those who are deprived of the guidance of the Qur’an in the absence With it, and whatever it is, the meaning is at all that a special partner of the infidels does not rejoice in their faith and they are the ones who have seen God

knowledge of the one who is in the affliction of you Therefore, he crossed the denial without denying.And he is affected by the disbelief to conduct the rulings of disbelief on him every saying or

the sake of the origin of the original in the news of the individuals, the verb was after whether it is a source of the source and the way of the way The two things are to hide the leveling between them until the questioners ask: I do so and so, so and so it is said that the two things are both in the past of the heritage with them and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is

infections The people who warn them are the Prophet, or did they not warn them, and they are convinced that if he had warned them, they would not repeat the faith, and it was said: They are on the authority of the answer to them.With this, all the costs that the grammarians imposed here and disappeared from what was answered by the research, as the formation of the gossip is out of the meaning The questioner, before it, if it is Arabized and the verb after the predominance of the beginning of the time, and the act of the verb, and the act of the one who is the same The gossip in the

mind in a garden, if the garden is like two disbelievers, both of me, and you will come to realize the perception of this installation in the saying Al -Arafa, whether you prayed to you, or you are fasting [Al -A'raf: 193], and Ibn Katheer read that I warn them of their two firsts.And they said they said about Nafaa and a brush about him in the narration of Baghdadin, Abu Amr and Abu Jaafar, as well as with the entry of a thousand among the two of the two, and the two of the people.Humza, Asam, and Al -Kisa’i read it by achieving the two gossip, which is a language.And the people of Egypt narrated on the way to replace the second hamor.Al -Zamakhshari said while he is a melody, and this weakens the narrators of the Egyptians from a spray, and this is a disagreement in the performance of performance, so it does not contradict the frequency.* * * They do not believe in the appearance that his sentence is a marketer for a report of the meaning of the sentence before it, and it is whether it is for them to warn them, so that you will be a second.The affirmation is used from the context and for you (P-252) to make it affirming it and on the two guys, so it was separated, either permissible for the first, or the one who came to the second Other faces that we do not multiply with its weakness, and it has been married in the scouts, making a sentence of whether they were warned by them, or did you not warn them, and they did not warn them.The endeavor and the master did not exist, as it is not the lapse of the news, it does not believe, but it is important to tell them about the warning of the warning and its numbers with them, for you Their affliction and their stupidity, and an excuse for the prophet ﷺ in the urgency of their faith, and it is recorded that those who did

what is not Abu Hamid al -Asfariyyini, and Abu Hamid al -Ghazali, and their harms are made, when the mask raises the face of the question, so it does not condemn it.This is that the referral of it is a referral for its own mind, such as the clay of the two, and it is a habit of usual, such as the difficulties There is one of its peers, and it is a referred to him, with which he looked at something else like the faith of those who know God, the soul of his faith, and the pilgrimage to whom he knows, It is unbearable as it is unbearable as it is in the words of the Almighty and does not carry us what is not energy for us [Al -Baqarah: 286], as what is meant is what is great and great, and he is given to it.It is appointed in some of it and commitment to some, and a metaphor in the bone, and it is released to it as the destiny as well, as the permissibility is released on the place, and on the authority of the place.He created from the division of the sections (P-253), and the disagreement of this brokenness is articles filled with hydro.It was for those who disagreed as the quarry of the vigor, so when God ran the flags, they denied what it complained, and opened its conclusion, it was found that the possibility is in the whole of the whole, because it is the same for the whole, because it is the same.If he wants, it is not violated in that Muslim.And it has proven that the permitted permissibility of wisdom is average at us and when the disgraceful, and if we disagree with the interpretation of judgment, the agreement of everyone is that it is a good time.The cost of it is the excuse of the fall.And it has proven that the forbidden to attach the knowledge to the number of its struggle is costly by it, and the cost of the closer is not permissible.The incorrect, preferring from God Almighty to say it and what he made on you in the debt from embarrassment [Hajj: 78] and his saying is that you will not be counted, and he will be blessed with you: To him, Ibn Al -Arabi in the rulings, this is the angel of the question on the face of the face that he is inherent in it, and its opponents are insulted.And it remains that we show you the face of the affiliation of the depression of those who know God, but his compliance or with whom God has informed, the Almighty is that he does not exceed it, and it is the one who is in this

him, with the saying You say there is no god but God and his saying to my father, Safyan, on the day of the conquest, close to you the article, and his uncle summed up a father who is like it, and it was not the same, and the day is not.The verse, when the supplication was general and they included them The general is the hero of the recipient of the verse and the mind of the mind, so it was not left until it was said why what was not devoted to those who have known the compliance of his compliance with the general in the general?This is the payment of this to specialize in these project, and it will be restricted, and the resurrection of the pilgrimage is weakened by them, and they are deluded, and they are the same The ruling of the chapter is between what is in its destiny and its knowledge, and among what is required by the legislation and the depression, and the secret of the wisdom in that is what we have in the places of the words of the words.Exaggeration of interpretation, and I think that you will be overwhelmed by its total number.
