The researcher of the Qur’an, O people, that I have a vow showing that they worship God, fear Him, and obey you, forgive you from your sins and delay you for a name that is called [Noah: 4] The people of al -Afriya on the sentence of we sent Noah to its people [Noah: 1] because it is in the sense of the Bayan for a sentence to warn the people of it [Noah: 1] God commanded him to say to them, but rather the action of Noah's saying to the significance that he was commanded to say and he said, he would be alerted him to the beginning The revelation of the revelation to Him from God is that his people will be warned.(P-188) And you have to make it a two-year-to-name to answer the question of the Samaid to ask what Noah did when God sent to him to warn the people of God: 1] And his call to call his people to call for their recklessness, and their condemnation with the title: that they are his people, a gift to the acceptance of his advice, if he does not.What he wants for itself.And the export of his call to the definition of affirmation; Because the addressees are hesitant in the news.And the vow: the warning is not a neighbor on the measure, which is like a mosque, and the same is a wise in the sense of a judge, and a pain in the sense of a painful, and a hearing in the meaning of the meaning A promise that is raised: The security of Rayyah al -Da’i al -Sama’i was submitted to the first Surah al -Baqara when he said, and they have a painful torment [Al -Baqarah: 10].And the consequence of the vow of the mourning of his saying, to worship God, fear Him, and obey him.And appreciation: I have a vow with a painful torment, if you do not worship God and did not fear him and did not obey me.And the indicated: It is permissible to be from the transgressor who is alienated by that, that is: a clarification or from the people of the packer, who is a synonym that the deceased, that is: a vow, is clear to you, Because I do not crave you from your calls for the benefit of the world, but it is extensive for you, and this is the same as his saying in the surah of the poets and what I ask you for the reward of God [Poets: 109] Fear God and obey [Poets: 110].And he is presented (for you) on his worker, and it is a vow to the perpetrator of the presentation of what was indicated by the lam from the vow of the warning of their deaths, not for his death.In the chest of his call, he gathered five affirmatives, which are: the call, and made the caller to say, O (people) added to his guarantee, and open his words with the ritual The explanation, and the presentation of its process.And (that) in (to worship) interpretation; Because he described (a vow) in it the meaning of the saying without his forefathers, and their command of the worship of God; Because they exposed them and forgot about them with their idols, and the people of Noah were partners, as he said to him, his words, the Almighty, in the Surah of Yunus.71].Thus, the state of the partners was the case of the Arabs, in the case of the people of Noah, completely.(P-189) and the fear of God His anger is a breakthrough, so this is from the relationship of judgment in the name of the self.And what is meant: a state of selfs, from the door of the deadness of you [Al -Ma’idah: 3], meaning: its eaters, that is: that they know that he does not satisfy his servants.And their obedience to Noh is their compliance with what they called for them from the neutrality, and the interpreters said: There was no Noah in the project of Noah except the supplication to the unicorn, so it is not in the custody of the custodian in the city of Obedience is in it, but there is no deity from the prohibition of the matches, such as killing the same and the robe of the money, so his saying is forgiven for you from the sins of you [4] Beginning to the sins of the traceable and prostrate.And reward for you from your sins [Noah: 4] in the answer to the three of the three, worship God, fear Him, and obey, that is: if you do so, God will forgive you.This is a promise of the other.And the ritual (from) is a further to the affirmation, and this is from the increase (from) in the affirmative on my opinion a lot of the nose of the grammar, like the fear and my father, Ali al -Farisi and Ibn Jinn.The saying of the Kasayi and all the grammarians of the kofa.It is necessary that faith must be accepted in the project of Noah, like the project of Islam.And it is permissible to be (from) to the metabolism, when those who have proven that and he is the choice of evangelization, that is: some of your sins will be forgiven for you, that is: the sins Noah is not required for the forgiveness of all the precedent sins, and the similarity of the partnership is required in all the sponsorship judgments, and the forgiveness of the sins It is not from his origins.Ibn Attiyah said: The meaning of Al -Tabad: The forgiveness of the preceding sins without what they are asking after.This is fulfilled and improved if we estimate that the project of Noah is comprehensive on the orders and from the procedures of the practical, so it is a remembrance (from) the opposite in the way.As for his saying and delaying you for a name named [Noah: 4], it is a good dimension of a worldly world that the people are equal in his desire, and it is the length of survival, so it is from the grace of the grace; Because in the mountain of man, the love of staying in life is in the life of the human beings.This is a law that God has made in the mountain of man to run the people of people on what is concerned with the memorization of the species.Al -Ma’ari said: ؎ He who wants to live and lives with it ∗∗∗ and the pleasure is tortured while it is the division and delay: against the miracle, and I may be released.And mobilization for the sake of something.(P-190) And I felt and its promise to them is the last that it is the last of their group, meaning: the group of its people; Because he was made a reward for everyone who worshiped God from them and feared him and obeyed the Messenger, so he referred to that he warned them in this way of that of the people of all of them, and that they were all of them To him, his saying to warn your people before they come to them with a painful torment [Noah: 1] as It is presented as a nose, and its words are interpreted in the Surah of Hood, and the king is manufactured, and the time he passed through it, the fullness Astronomy is made for a severity of it.It is the matter of the flood, so it is appointed that the delay is here is the number of their recession.The meaning: The people are all late for a nameful term, which is the deadlines of their own, and they are varying.The name is the name: it is the deadline appointed by the appreciation of God at the creation of every one of them, so the obedience is in (sake) for the nominal, meaning: the gender, and it is true Her companions, as he said, is the Almighty, whoever dies, and whoever is returned to the reverence of the age [Hajj: 5], and the meaning of the name is that it is a specific one, which is in the saying of the Almighty and the sake of the name of God.Wall Anam.The name of the name is the age of every one who is appointed to him in the hour of his creation referred to him in the hadith.The name was receptive to the seizures of the similarity of the confusion between the owners of the deadlines.The meaning: It is delayed, so it does not accelerate all of you, so every one will be delayed to the sake of its appointed time to it.The meaning of this verse is the meaning of the meaning of the Surda Huds, and that you seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to him, enjoying good pleasures for a good term [Hood: 3]
