The Quranic researcher is then for the lies who lie on the Day of Religion and what is denying it except for every sinful person who is dominated by our verses.A sentence of one day for the lying, it is permissible to be clear to the guarantee of a sentence that does not think that they are the ones who are the one who is a good day: A day that benefits his intention is a sentence that is made, the denials are made for its estimation: the day when the people of the Lord of the two worlds rise to the Lord of the two worlds.It is permissible to be a predecessor and between the lies in the Day of Religion and those who are generalized, general, special and void, so whoever lies are those who are desperate Muslims and the people of a book that do not lie to the Day of Religion, so this sentence will be a combination of the integration of the shameful people who are lying in the day of the day Wrapped up.The liars were mentioned, beautiful in his saying: For the lies, then I will be detailed in the statement of the attachment of the denying, and it is on the day of the religion of the religion So the silent of them and other than the Muslims and the people of the book, so the description is here for the guidance and warning the sins of the Muslims who are the Muslims They will be in the house of the lies of the penalty on it.And the meaning of denying the day of religion is denying its struggle.The denying the day of the penalty is the origin of the feet on the places and the parties, and that is followed by his saying: What is denying it except for every one who is a sinful one who is a sinner, if you are a sinner, if you are a sinner, if you are a sinner, if you are a sinner, if he is a sinner, if he is a sinner, if you are a good one who is a sinner.The first (P-197), that is, to distort them with ignorance of the ruling of God Almighty in the creation of God and their depositism, as the rule is from the creation of people, and the people of the people Their system.So they came to the parties, commanding the guns and bearing corruption.The part of them arranged for them the righteous and dignity, and on their work in the bad, with torment and insult.Everyone according to his work: If only the Creator is the most promoted of his creatures and the most important of the righteous and the spoilers, it was not for you from the ritual of the righteous.Rather, we created you in vain, and that you do not return [the believers: 115].And it was mentioned to the lying on the Day of Religion three descriptions, which are: a bit, a sinner, who says that the verses are the first legends.And the ritual: the injustice, and the aggressor: the shared and the infidel with what it came from the parties because they were accustomed to God with the argument, and on his messengers, and the sake of the right They look at it or do not work with it.The sinner: exaggerated in the sinner, that is: the multiplicity of sin.And the form of the palace of negation and the discretion, it benefits the palace of the adjective of the denying the Day of Religion on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.It is a liquid On the basis, it is a true shortening; Because the Day of Religion is not denying it except for the one who is involved, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is shared by the three.The Sabeans do not lie to the Day of Religion, and many of the people of the polytheism do not deny the Day of Religion, like the people of the religion of the dignity.Those who lie to the Day of Religion are the partners of the Arabs and those who are young are like the forefront, so they have achieved the first and second characteristics, and it is the one who is The Qur’an is the first legends, as it is the article of those who share the Arabs, and they are the ones who are intended, and others are not among them.To say it, or say what it is equal, or he is to him; Because whoever the Qur’an was not offered to him, if the Qur’an was presented to him, he lied to him (P-198).The Qur’an is the legends of the first, so they thought about the Qur’an.And you have to make the palace claimed and not fulfilled to download those who did not say that in the Qur’an, and the meaning of the claim is that whoever does not affect the saying of the Qur’an in the Qur’an They have been made by their lies on the Day of Religion, as they are a dungeon in the height of the denying the partners in the Day of Religion.And a sentence, if our verses are recited to him, the myths of the first said a row of a bound or a state of it.And the verses here are the Qur’an and its rewards because they are recited and read.And myths: the collection of the legends, which is the story, and the most intended that the short cut that did not fall and the partners are looking at the story of the Qur’an, And Safniyear, at the Persians, and for the word is Arabized by the Roman, and the words are presented to him when he said: He says: The first [Al -Anam: 25] in Surah Al -Anam.What is meant by the first two preceding nations; Because the first is called the precedent on the face of the suspicion that he was the first of the lineage to a second after him, and if he was preceded by generations, and he was the one.That is why they heard in it from the stories that were given to them the argument of the preaching and the administer, so they calculated it from the stories of the acres.And they were limited to that without the most of the Qur’an from the high facts and wisdom.Two of them.And whoever they said, that is the son of Al -Harith, and he wrote the story of you and the story of Asfandiard and found it in the life, so he would have spoken to it in the A conversation from Muhammad, but it talks to you with the first legends.It is not intended in the verse of its own; Because the word of every aggressor is a phenomenon in the number of specialization.
