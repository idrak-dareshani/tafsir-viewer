The Quranic researcher, and whoever created and created and made it a long money and sons of witnesses and threw for him a majestic, and then reassure that I am more than all of the people: That is a day, a day for the infidels [Al -Muddathir: 9].And I refer to what the Messenger ﷺ from the infidels is delivered by his saying and your Lord, and be patient [Al -Muddathir: 7] The words were transmitted to the remembrance of a leader from the leaders of the disbelievers and the mourning And calling the Messenger ﷺ.He said it to me and whoever created and only.An exile that is permissible to have been a matter of this is the reason for the descent of this verse, the heels of the verses before it, and that is when it was lost in the Mecca that the Messenger of God Freak and that he was commanded to warn, and this is indicated by the son of Isaac that he had a slander of a village from a Quraysh in the father of a flame, and Abu Sufyan, and the son of the son, and the son of the son, Al -Harith, Umaya Bin Khawal, Al -Asi Bin Wali, and Al -Mutamaa ibn Uday.They said: The Arabs will be presented to you in the name, and they wonder about the matter of Muhammad, and you have disagreed with the news about it.He who says he says: Crazy, and another says: a priest, and another says: a poet, and the Arab knows that all of this is not gathered in one man, so they are called a name You are gathered on him and called him the Arabs with him, so a man of them said: A poet, and Al -Walid ibn al -Mughira said: I heard the words of Ibn al -Abraa - The illiteracy of the son of Abi Al -Salat, and I know all the poetry and what the words of Muhammad like the words of a poet, so they said: A priest, so the Walid said: What is the bit of the priest.And the priest believes and lied to and did not lie.His immortality, or his whispering, and they said: West, the Walid said: We have seen the magic and their magic, so what is its puff and not its contract, and the waters of the wilder I am ignorant and said: What are you, Abu Abed Shams?Al-Wasid said: I thought in (P-303) a Muhammad's matter, and if I say it is that they say: And between the woman and his wife, and between the one and his twenty, Ibn Ishaq said: So God revealed in Al -Walid ibn al -Mughara, his saying is the one who created me.On the authority of Abu Nasr al -Qushari, he said: It was said that the prophet was attained ﷺ The saying of the disbelievers of Mecca: You are a wicked and found from that cloud and then he said: So warn [Al -Muddathir: 2].Whatever was the agreement that the agreement was made that this saying was issued about Al -Walid ibn al -Mughira and that it is the meaning of his saying of the Almighty and whoever was created and only if it was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was After we came down the chest of this surah, the sentence of my atom and who I was created and created, and it is not an apparent navigational, and if the words of the Walid are the reason for the descent of the surah, it was connected to the saying of his saying: 7] On the authority of the matter of patience, that God takes over the reward of this saying, and what is between them is symptoms, and he supports this that the rituals of the revelation were in the way that was in the way that was in the way of Forty day on the correct one, whether it is a neighborhood between the beginning of the live and his time, a period The month of Dhu al -Qaddah is honored to support, so that is the period of approaching the name, so I took the partners in the number of what they say to the luminous, if they have been tested, if they tell them if they are tired.The Prophet ﷺ.And the sentence of the sentence with the verb (my atom) is a gesture to the Messenger ﷺ was charged and overwhelmed by what was created by Al -Walid ibn al -Mughira, so his connection with the saying of God: 7] It is cloudy.And what is in the past (my atom) was presented, and such, from the support and the return to the remembrance after Wow, in the interpretation of his saying, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the same.The Wall of the Pen.He came with the connector, his connection in his saying, and whoever created and only to integrate the registration of the disbelief of the Wasid, the grace in the return and the supply.He (only) was erected by (who).Al -Wahid: The alienation from others in a place or a state of what indicates the context of speech, or a month or a story, and it is an act of one from the door of generosity and knowledge.(P-304) The Walid ibn al-Mughira was dubbed in the Quraysh with the only one to be crowded and his individuality with the advantages of his advantages, and he did not gather from him, and he did not gather from him.The boy is the capacity of money, his glory and the gloriousness of his father before him, and he was returning Quraysh in their affairs; Because he was the elder than my father, Jahl and my father, Safyan, when he was famous for the neutral title, this speech was a gesture to the Walid ibn al -Mujira, which is famous for it.This description came after the verb (I was created) to discourage this description of what was intended for it, and he will leave to what he reconciles to be compared to the verb of (any) Money, banks, and simplicity, and he will change from the supply of praise and praise that they were devoting to it, to the extent of the extraction to God, who is the state of all the creatures of the one who is a good man And God has brought you out of the curtains of your mothers, you do not know anything [Al -Nahl: 78] the verse.It was composed on that and made money for him for the year.And the Mandoud: The name is an act of the extension of the meaning: it was prolonged, that the likeness of the many money was seen at the time of the area of ​​the body, or from the extension of the one who is in the sense of the one who is in the meaning of the one who is in the sense of the one who is in the meaning of the one who said: The valley is the river, that is: more money in its estimated, what its owner acquires from the attributes.The Walid was one of the exalted Quraysh.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas: The money of the Walid was between Mecca And the sects of camels, sheep, slaves, neighborhood, and heaven, and the boil of his money was a thousand dinars - that is: in the Sunnah -.And God blessed him with the blessing of the children and described them with witnesses of a witness, meaning: present, that is: they do not separate him, so he will be insulted by the one who does not see it.And the fear of the traveler of the traveler on them, and they were rich in order to ask for the sustenance with a merchant or a laureate, and they were witnessing with him the harshs, so they would have been for him, and they were for him, and he was for him.Three ten years were said, and the one is seven of them, and they are: Al -Walid ibn Al -Walid, Khalid, Al -Ammar, Hisham, Al -Asi, Qais or Abu Qais, and Abd al -Shams Ibn Hazm remembers the Ashraf Al -Awasiyah, and he was destroyed by six.And the guidance: the source (Mahda) by tightening the distraction, indicating the power of the Mahdah.The Mahdah: the level of the earth and the removal of what is destroyed by the rumor to it, and the Mahdi al -Sabi, called the source.And the guidance here is a bothering to facilitate its affairs and the penetration of his word in his people, in which he is not difficult for him to be asked and does not disobey him.(P-305) And I was assured (Mahda) with his export on the reactionary, to be cursed by his denial to benefit the greatness of that Emphasis to raise the imperfection of the metaphor.And it was described in this verse with what it has of grace and capacity; Because the verse is in the context of the one who is a delegation to it, to be watered by its watershes and its misfortune in the world and the torment of the fire in the hereafter.As for the verse of Surah Al -Qlama, he has looked and described it in what is in it in the words of his words, and not all the humiliating sweets [pen: 10] etc.Bin Al -Mughara (I knew that it was an involvement); Because that verse is in the place of warning from its evil and its treachery.And (then) in his saying, then he reassures the arrogant cries, meaning: and the greatest of that is that he is listening to the increase in that blessings, and that is what is known.This is a sense of the repetition of the one in which he has been in it, and he declared it in his saying (all).And the poison: the great request of the thing, and the attachment of his greed is made of what God has made for him; Because they did not support the livelihood of idols or; Because he was a greed for the increase in the grace, not to remember that it is from God, so the chain of transmission is the chain of transmission to the guilt of the Majestic, in a way that is reminded of it, so that it is what he has.He is his blessing, so he shared it with him other than him in worship.And for this joke is amended from it to be said: he is reassured in the increase, or he is reassured that it is increased.And (all) is a deterrent and heroic to his heat in the increase of blessings and cut off his hope.And what is meant is to inform this to him with the abandonment of the prophet ﷺ that the Walid will be cut off from the livelihood of the liveli So he will give them their stubbornness They do not harm them; Because they do not count a life after this, as God has said from the saying of Moses - peace be upon him - our Lord, that you have come to Pharaoh and his fullness in the abundance To be misleading from your path, our Lord, whispering with their money, and stressing their hearts, so they do not believe until they see the painful torment [Yunus: 88].And in this heights and deterrence, marking that the disbelief of the blessing is because of its cutting, the Almighty said, “If you thank you, I will increase you, and if you disbelieve, I will not be a torment.” [7] And for this, Sheikh Ibn Ata Allah said: Whoever does not thank the blessings, he has been subjected to her loudspeakers, and whoever thanked her, he has restricted her with her reason.
