The Quranic researcher (P-206) Noah, Lord, said that they disobeyed me and followed those who did not increase his money and his child except a loss and a deceitful deception of old And he does not take care of, hindering, and ease, this sentence is a substitute for a sentence.Because the story of the disobedience of his people is what he was filled with a story that he called them, so it is necessary for the two articles to be in one time in which he came to the one who came to the one who came to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the Prophet His command has his saying to warn your people before they come to them with a painful torment [Noah: 1] so that the return of the verb (he said) will be made from the mention of the worker of the worker of it The Almighty will be a feast for our first and last [Al -Ma’idah: 114], to link between his words to the chapter of the chapter between them.It is necessary that the two statements be in two times, the Qur’an is a story for his answer to his Lord, so you will be a return of action (he said) when he mentioned with us with the reference to the reference The two sayings.It is permissible for the sentence to be a biased bias; Because what preceded her from his saying, my Lord said that I called my people [Noah: 5] to here, which raises the wonder of the state of his people who are telling the one who wonders from the one who wonders from the one who wonders from the one who wonder So the remembrance of this is the same as the sentence and after it to say it as support.And this is the last of his saying, my Lord said that I called my people night and day [Noah: 5] a promise to complain about them; Because this is the story of their disobedience after the preaching of the preacher to them by saying that he sends the sky on you with a calm [Noah: 11] And the appearance of the name (Noah) with the second saying without a distance from the distance of the hostile, if the verb would be borne, and this news is used in the need for it, as it is in the same way Lord, etc.And the assertion of the news (that) is to be fulfilled by the use in which it is used in it.Then he mentioned that they took the saying of those who repeat them from the acceptance of the call of Noah, meaning: follow their prevailing and led them.And he adjusted the expression of their greatness and the like to the connection because of what the prayer is given to him by the rumors of God, with the righteousness of God.So they stirred the grace with them, a loss and misguidance.And it is intended in the prayer that they are the people of money and the children of gesture until that caused the penetration of their saying in (P-207) their people and the people of the people of them: To reflect their followers, the Almighty said that those who disbelieve spend their mothers to resonate with the path of God [Al -Anfal: 36], and their children are their people.The meaning: follow the people of the money and the children that these money and children did not increase except for a loss because they used it to support the infidels and corruption, for the sake They have money and no births, so they were less committed to corruption.And the first of the lies and the lies are the first of the grace and their humiliation is a little [Al -Muzzammil: 11].And the loss: a bothering to obtain evil from the means of its affairs to be the reason for the good as a loss They are like them in the loss, and they calculate that they guided them to success.And what is true of the people of the people, the people of money and children, they have increased with that, without thank you, and they prevailed, and for that, the guarantor of the gathering is restored to him, And they said, and he said it and they have lost many [Noah: 24].Nafaa, Ibn Amir, Asim, and Abu Jaafar (and his son) read the opening of the waw, the opening of the lam, and the son of Katir, Abu Omar, Hamza, the sake of the (And he was born) by adding the waw and making the pain, as for the boy, with the opening of the waw and the opening of the pain, a name is called one of the children and the gathering of the gathering, With a compassion, it was said: It is a language in a son, so the one is equal to the one and the collection is the same as the ark.It was said: It is the whole of a lion as a plural of a lion.And the deceased: hiding the work or the opinion that the harm of others is intended, that is: they are in the past The trick is to kill Noah, and to fight people on his harm and harm to it.And oldness: exaggeration, that is, a great large, and it is a response to this formula in a little wallet, such as long, that is: very long, and wondrous, that is, the wonders, and the wonders, and the wonders, and the wonders, Jamil, readers of many readers, light, that is: a luminous.Issa ibn Omar said: It is a Yumna language.(And they said, do not distract your gods, and do not distract from friendliness, no kindness), etc., meaning: some of them (P-208) said to some: friendliness, kindness, and shattering, hindering, and eclipse, this is the ease of this.This is how she knows that its names are not running in the interests of the Arabic words, and in Waw (Wad), there are two languages ​​for the Arabs of them who include waw, and it has a reader.And among them who opens the waw, and so read the rest.Al -Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas: Wadi and kinds, and he is reluctant, hindered and ease: The councils of whom were wearing the nurses, and they called them their names, so they did, and you did not worship even if it was destroyed by those, and the knowledge of the knowledge, It is the names of five children of Adam - peace be upon him - and they were worshipers.And on the authority of Al -Mawardi that (friendly) is the first idol.And the verse requires that these erection were worshiped before the flood, and some of those who are interpreters said: These idols were established for some of the righteous Some of them: They were idols between Adam and Zannah.This is not instead of the flood of the flood, as it must be its dryness, and the skin was saved from the agrea after the flood, With the existence of this name in the doors of the Arabs to the time of the Muhammad al -Muhammad, it was in the duration of the Jandal - in the country of a dog - the name of its name.It was said that he was on a picture of a man and was from whistling and bullets, and he was on the image It is intended to go with a ritual - a idol of his name, and it was also for the hypnotics and took it.They worshiped him, then the children of Najia Ramwa were removed from the top, and they were blessed, and they flee with it to the horse, my brother, the sons of al -Harith from Khazra.Abu Uthaman al -Nahadi said: I saw that he was gunfire and they were carrying it on a camel that was beaten - with the task of the task, that is, it is tied to his hand if he walked - and he will not see him It will be the one who blesses you, so if he blesses, they will come down and said that the house is satisfied with you, and they will be struck by it with a building that will come down around it.He was giving up a lion's image.And he had a idol of his name, whose name is hindered while he was on the image of a horse.(P-209) It was a bay and the one of them was a class whose name is a pleasure on the image of the eagle of the bird.This is a narrator in Sahih Al -Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas.And he said: The second that was in the people of Noah to the Arabs, uh.It is permissible to be transmitted with its signs, and it is permissible for the Arabs to be poisoned and put in place for them.This was forced to do this to the interpretation of the verse by the fact that the return of a guarantee (they said) to the Arabs of the Arabs, and that the remembrance of that in the heart of the story of the story Theorization, meaning: the Arabs said that they are for some of them: Do not give your gods friendly and kinds, and he is giving up, hindering and firmly as he said, as the people of their people said, “Do not follow them, do not By mentioning after that to the people of Noah, and it is a sign of showing and dismantling to the parts of the word.The best is what some of those who see it and what we want with Bayan: that the idols of the people of Noah have been created and the flooding was immersed They survived with Noah from the believers, so they remembered them and preached to their affairs with what they have befell their predecessors from the slander of those of those idols, so the rest of them, so that the names are left The Arabs are the ones in the effects of their science and their news, so Amr ibn Lahi al -Khuza’i, who brought the Arabs to the worship of the idols, came to the Arabs, so he called them the idols, so they are the same.By the interpretation of the enthusiasm of the idols that were for this name at the Arabs, nor to the remembrance of the doors that worshiped the names of these names.Then it is necessary for the people to be many idols, many of which were collected by their great saying: Do not be distressed by your gods, and then they are the most male, and it is the most male, and it is the greatest.It will be its remembrance of the special kindness of the year to the Head of Him as His Excellency the Exalted, whoever was an enemy of God and his angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Micalah [Al -Baqarah: 98].It is necessary for them to be other than those five idols, so their remembrance will be separated after the busts of the mourning for them and the compassion is from the virginity.And the purpose of the confirmation, I will restore the verb of the termination and do not be destroyed, and the way of creativity did not possess, and the righteous confirmation may be associated with the emotion, as well [Breakfast: 17] Then I realize the day of religion [Al -Anfar: 18].And it was transferred from the Al -Alwsi in the way of his interpretation of this verse of this paragraph: the Ephrang was brought out in the limits of the thousand, the two hundred and the two of the two, and the two of the two, the two sins, and the one The connection has been a number of three thousand years ago.And the (no) navigate in its saying, no kindness, and the (P-2110) to confirm the negation, which is in its saying, does not give your god And fed up; Because the recovery is ongoing that it is not added to the affirmation of three times.Nafaa and Abu Jaafar (wad) read the waw.And it was read by others with the opening of the waw, which is a cumer name in which the Arabic tongue is shown, how they will.
