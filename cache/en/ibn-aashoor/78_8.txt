Because the formula of harming is used to intend the image of the image of the verb, as it is in the saying of the Almighty: then the clouds are enriched [Rom: 48], so the one who comes to the one who does Wading [the Prophet: 6] It benefits the recall of the view of the view in the creation of the earth and the mountains; It is the visions of them.It is more than that the views are overlooked from reflection on its privileges to accustom them to their witnesses before the age They look at it, but they think about its makers, and the mountains are running away from thinking about its makers, they occupy them with the sake of its difficulty, and the ware of it Their righteousness is that its reefs are misled, and the look at the enemy is the enemy when it is the one who watched it, so the verb is the one who is the one who is mentioned with the remembrance Reconciliation and release the reciprocate to be their acknowledgment of what they decided in insight, so they do not find denial.He came with the verb that is going on in his saying: We created you more and after it;
