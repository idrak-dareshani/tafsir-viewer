The Quranic researcher (P-381) (As for those who were given, feared, and believed in goodness, we will facilitate him for the family, and as for those who have gone, he took advantage of and lied to the good, so he will not be.His money if he wants.A condition and a condition of a condition, because it is in the sense that it is of nothing, and detailing: dismantling between a multi -one that has been shared in a state of state and separated from it.It is based on its way.The masculine pursuit, but the detailing is made with the patience of the people with his saying: (As for those who have been given) because the task is the disagreement of the conditions of those who seek the right of the people, and they will be in the face Differentiation, according to their endeavors, equals the rhythm of the endeavor in detailing, and this is art from the two fabrications of the eloquent speech that is made from it, such as the saying of the nap Until my fear increases on and in the airport, meaning: on the fear and the highest.Al -Qarra Wall.Displacement (scattered) in two parties: an easy way for a family and a facilitator for the Asri; The different of the work is in them, such as its words, the high: And whoever works as a virginity of evil, he sees [the earthquake: 8] in the surah of the zero.And he lied to the good, and that is a number that is correct to be a bay Giving, fears, and charity with goodness.The interpreters are the one who recalls Abu Safyan Bin Harb, Aweda, Bin Bin Khawal, and it was said.The last is necessary that the surah is civil, and because of the descent is not the general.The house of the obligation to the purification of its use in giving the money, and for that the money is called the giving, and the intended is to give zakat.Likewise, a verb was deleted, feared because he knows that the estimated feared God.This is the three of the faith during the faith.44] That is: We were not among the people of faith.Likewise, the verb (abundance) did not mention his attachment because he wanted the heart with money.And (sought refuge) was made an interview for (feared), so what is meant by him is the one who sought refrain from compliance with the command of God and called Him; Because Egypt is on the disbelievers exposed to the supplication, it is the same as the rich of God, satisfied with the state of the idols and its people, for the one who is in the same Sin, he was answered in the sense of answering.He may want the increase in the request of richness with the tears with money, so the Sunnah and the Tax will be for the request, and this is a severity of his being from the two participants.Al -Hasani: The good is the goodness, it is a row of the description of an estimated Sufism, and its rituals are felt that its Muwasouf is the estimated, and it is considered that the feminine is a feminine.Many like a garment, victory, enemy, or punishment.This description may become a flag of prevailing, so he said: Al-Hasan Al-Junna, and it was said: the word (P-383) testimony, and it was said: prayer, and it was said: Zakat.And on all the faces, the belief in it is the confession with its struggles, and it will be made by the desire to obtain it.And he has the same levels of beliefs, with the goodness of God, with the good of the garment, victory, or the disagreement of what is wrapped, so he returns this belief to faith.And they include that he does the work that the win is good.Therefore, he said in the other slit with his saying: (He lied to goodness).And the tesir: making something that facilitates the crops, and the verb of the action of the facilitation is the thing that makes it easy, that is, it is not severe, and the course is the same The difficult thing is for its sake, and it is the one who increases with the ease of the matter, as it is in the words of the Almighty: (And it is easy for me [Taha: 26]) [Moon: 17]).And Al -Yousry in his saying: (Lysri) is what is not a hardship in it.Its ethics: either by the interpretation of the situation, that is, the case that is not caused to it in the hereafter, which is the condition of the naked, or on its interpretation in the place.The captain was pleased with paradise from Zayd ibn Aslam and Mujadd.The memorizers began with many suffering in the suffering of the benefits that are not sacrificed on his owner, meaning: the shelter.Al -Asri: Either the situation, which is the state of hardship and the intensity, or its place, which is hell, because it is the place of hardship and the hardships on its people, the Almighty said: The disbelievers are not easy [Al -Muddathir: 10]) So the meaning of (we facilitate it): We study it in the work of happiness and the misery, and it is easy for the son of Attiyah, so the righteousness is the righteous.It was described With the secret, by adopting its punishment for its owner, and the hardships are the bad works by adopting their punishment on her owner, so they will be blessed with them, so they will be blessed.Business.And the exhaustion of this interpretation of this interpretation will be the intended from the end of now to the last life as his saying: (He said, I seek forgiveness for you [98].And the (Al) in (Al -Yousry) and in (Al -Asri) was added to define the sex or for the covenant to disturb the suffering.(P-384) And when the arrangement of the system came in this verse on the opposite of the one, as it was made the guarantee of the unseen in (Nisra, it is for me) to the one who is the one who is given) And the guarantee of the absence was made in (we facilitate the Asri), which is to the one who is the one who is misled) With the imam: (Al -Asri) and (Al -Asri), and they do not interact with the least of those who are given or whoever is a disgrace, appointing the interpretation of the verse of the verse with the first one: the first: the first: the first: (We are easy) on his truth and made the words running on the contradiction of the opposite of the phenomenon of the heart of the heart by that the origin of the words is: so we will not be the one who is the one who is the one.There must be a requirement for the heart, so it is necessary that it is necessary to benefit the exaggeration in this facilitator until the facilitator is made to him and the easy thing for him They directed the saying of the Arabs: I presented the camel on the basis.The second: that the facilitator is a usual metaphor sent in the end and the supply of the relationship His saying: (Lysari) and (Lamsari) Lam Al -Talil, that is: his facilitation for the sake of the captain or for the sake of the Asri, so what is meant by the secret of the paradise, That the description has become a flag of prevailing over paradise and on fire, and the end is not the same as paradise and the same fire, so you will see the estimation of the addition of the one who is added.It is estimated: the entry of the captain and the entry of the Asri, meaning: we will hurry for it.The meaning: We will make the entry of this paradise quickly and the entry of the other to the fire quickly, as difficulty in difficulty; Because the difficulty is the exhaustion, and the wrestling easy, and from it the saying of the Almighty: (That is a good morning to us [s: 44]) meaning: an ultimate urgent.It is on this direction his saying: (So we will facilitate the Asri), problems that were built on the rule of assumption of the Qur’an, and the saying of it (Al -Asri) This is that the verb (we can) set the guarantor of the one (gave, feared and believed), and the one who (abandoned and dispensed and lied), so it is a teeth that arises from the arrival of the hearts of the bonds) Or the meaning of (seeking), as the constraints are preceded, not referred.The facilitator is accepted after its obtaining it (P-385), facilitating what increased its crops, that is: it is permanent to it and the treasure of it.It is permissible to be the meaning of the verse: to make the facilitation on its right and make the captains and a description, meaning: the situation is the secret, and the Asri, meaning: the case is not.It is not a heart.And facilitation in the sense of the permanent work, in the authenticity of Al -Bukhari on the authority of Ali, he said: “We were with the Messenger of God in the sake of the place of gratitude in a funeral, and he said: His seat from paradise and his seat from the fire, so they said: O Messenger of God, do we not trust?He said: Do every easy entity for what was created for him, but the people of happiness are easy to work for the work of the people He read (As for those who were given, feared and believed in good deeds, he will make it easier for the family.So the hadith is not related to what this verse included; Because his saying: “There is no one except that his seat has written” The people of the fire until he was fulfilled, and he said: “And his seat was written.” Increase in it and not deficient, such as the one who is written, as it does not accept an increase or decrease without the saying that is not written, so it does not connect.So the question arose from the one who asked about the work of the work that the people do, and the meaning of his answer: that the good deeds are good that it is a person on the punishment.And his interview is mentioned, which is the bad deed, to complete the vagina, and there is no relationship with him to answer.And his metaphor is similar to what was used in this verse because it is in the hadith that the work of the people of happiness is related to the work of the people of happiness, so it is that it is a matter For tights, they are good or bad.So who is associated with the verse of the prophetic memorial is that the Prophet ﷺ followed his words that he read (as for whoever was given and feared) the verse; Because he read it to show it and remedy his words, so the verse had to be related to the prophetic words, and the place of the recipient was the saying of the Almighty: (P-386) It is intended to prove that one of the affairs of God is the highest that is easy for the servant to work with the work of happiness or the work of the misery, whether it was the work For the slander, like the disbelief, or the work of what increases happiness and decreases from the slander, and that is in the validity of the righteous.Because the confirmation of one of the meanings of the tesir indicates the confirmation of its gender, and it will be a sign of the confirmation of the facilitation from its origin.Or the intended is from the point of the verse that is based on its saying: (Do); Because the verse was mentioned in work and mentioned a facilitator for the essential and a facilitator for the Asri, so the hadith is a sign that the work is the tissue, The captains are meaning that happiness and the Asiri mean by the righteousness, and it is true of the widening of the paradise, and the distress of the distraction in the fire.And if the promise is to facilitate the secret of the owner of those prayers that indicate the giving, piety and beliefs of goodness, your negativeness was the way to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the way Types, so that the tesir is caused by those prayers, that is: a reward for its action.The facilitator: the permanence of it, and the captain will be a description of the tanks, and that is from the purification in the place of guarantee.And the origin: a facilitator with his work, and the guarantee is amended to the description of the captivity to the blessing on those aspirations that it is an easy way from God as the saying of God: 8]) In Surah Al -above.And the conversion of the hadith is that it is a way for the difference between the knowledge of God with the hopes of His worshipers before they do it, and between the conversation of his speech, and what is his speech, and what is the one who is in his speech, Difficult and interior.Hell.Rather, it was given to giving the remembrance in his saying: (As for those who were given and feared) with the merit of (feared) to benefit him, and the miserliness was given by the remembrance in his saying: Incalling (seeking) to him, to urge the Muslims to give, so giving and piety is the slogan of Muslims with belief in goodness, and against the three of the three.(P-387) In the verse, the collection is good with the division, and the goodness of the student, the four times between (I give) and (Bakhl), and between (I feared) and (I seek) and (I seek) And (lied), and between (Al -Asri) and (Al -Asri).And the sentence (and what he sings about his money if he wants) is a compassion for a sentence (so we will make it easier for the family), meaning: we will hurry with it to Hell.The estimation: if it is mentioned in it.And Al -Taradi: The stallion is from high to the bottom, meaning: His money is not enriched by him, which he has given him something from the torment of fire.And (what) may be navigational.And the appreciation: and a sword that his money will not be enriched if he falls into hell, and it is necessary to be exclusive, and it is a denial of denying and stinging.It is permissible for this direction to be the waw for the nose.And the meaning: What he sings about his money, which he has made.Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Akrama on the authority of Ibn Abbas, “It was a man from the hypocrites.A boy for that Muslim, so the owner of the palm tree was removed from their hands, so the Muslim woman is a good He left it for them and has a palm tree in Paradise, and he did not do, and he heard that Abu Dahdah Al -Ansari, so that the palm tree is from its owner In which he is fourth in it, and it came to the Prophet ﷺ He said: O Messenger of God, bought it from me with a snare in paradise, and he said: Yes, and the one who is the one who is the one The owner of the boy, Akrama said: Ibn Abbas said: God Almighty revealed (and the night if he falsifies [Al -Layl: 1]) to his saying: (for the hardship) and it is a hadith that is a hardship Abbas: So God Almighty (and the night if he fades [night: 1]) He said a group: the surah is civil.And we have shown us in the fifth presentation that it is many in the words of the advanced, their saying: So God descends in such a saying that, such, that they want (P-388) (P-388) (P-388) It is included in the verse.It was narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: “How many honesty in the paradise of the father of the Dahdah.” Like a taste of money on my father Al -Dahdah
