The Quranic researcher, we worship you, and we seek help if the Hamid is praised by his Lord, takes in the direction to him by the convergence of the salvation, to him, he moved from the disclosure of the truth His right to His servant requires him to worship him with worship and use.And the keys to the greatness in the glorification of them before them before they address an Arabic method.(P-178), Abu al-Farj al-Asfahi, narrated from Hasan ibn Thabat, who said: I was with the enemy, so I regret it and I ate with it, so I am on the authority of it, if it is in it, if it is in it.Him: الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الن الم Al -Naamman: Isn't my father Imam?The nickname of the naps, they said: Yes, he said: So let him go to him and entered.And the resignation from the sides of the hadith is with the way of the absent, the beginning of its saying, “Praise be to God” to the saying of the king of the Day of Religion [Al -Fatihah: 4], to the sides of the He said to you, we worship him to the last of the Surah, as an art of the art of the word of the words of the Arabs at the Arabs, and it is the name in the science of Arabic literature and rhetoric.And in the formation of the rituals of the rituals of the people of the knowledge of the rhetoric: one of them is my opinion of the one who is the silence of the imams In one of the three ways of speaking, unseen, or discourse, he takes in his words that, and he expresses that self with another way of those of the three, and the one who makes them so The name of the folds is to express the same way from the way of speaking, discourse or absence, as one of them is the one who is the right to express in this way.The effect of the dispute appears between the crowd and the tranquilizer in the improvement, which is called the glorification in the knowledge of the bodies, such as the saying of Ali ibn Abd al -Abda There is a heart in the charity, which is addressed to its soul, on the way of the murder.Tafsa on the opinion of the gathering by administering that the next one speaking about the way he gave him to another method that resembles the state of view of something The name of the fools on the opinion of the silence, so it will be made on the predominance of the duties of the tafs without the image of the exit, and perhaps the silence of this is the same as the time that this is the same as this.She was decided before him, and he followed the gathering in this name.It is obligatory (P-179) to be alerted to him that the dahda name is considered to be the one who is absent from both of the two opinion.The two opinion is that what was before the first The surah is to his saying: “We worship” a refreshing of the phenomenon name, which is the name of Majesty and his attributes.And for the people of the rhetoric with the cultivation of tattooing, because there is a newness of the transit of expressing the meaning of its eyes, avoiding the release of the one who is the same By renewing the tubes, the stammer of the activity of the Samaid is not tired of returning the same eyes.Al -Sakaki said in the key after it was mentioned that the Arabs are abundant from the fools: they missed them, they improve the villages of the ghosts, so they will be among the people, and they are not.They improve the villages of the signs, and they will be violated between the stems and the tubes.This is a pluralistic, and it is strained in tattooing.Then the abolition does not insist on it, but they take into account the tattooing of the sects and occasions.And what is the fools is a bareness, for the Hamid, when God praised and described it as the great characteristics of the attributes, reached the idea of ​​it, so it would be imagined, so he imagined the soul of the soul.His Lord is in honor, as the opposite of these fools in the saying of Muhammad ibn Bashir al -Kharji, as a result of the sons of the outside of a tribe: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ول ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ You have rewarded her and her craftsmanship.He obeyed her, so he addressed him, then he mentioned the shortcomings of his opinion, and he used to himself on the good, so you turned from his speech to the abbreviation of it, then it is the one who said it.As if he imagined it, he had diminished until he was absent from him.And by the opposite of that, the Almighty saying, and those who disbelieved in the verses of God and to meet him, those who despair of my mercy [Al -Ankabut: 23] to administer the disbelief of them.Express the verses of the owner of that generous name, and after that, he was transferred to the repetition of the guarantor of the speaker, as it is the origin of the expression of the same.And what fools increases in the verse that it is rid of the praise to supplication, and there is no doubt that the supplication requires the discourse, so the saying of you, we worship you And his counterpart in that is the saying of the jungle in the lament of the Gasanian enemy: I refuse to disappear that if I remember it ∗∗∗ I move a disease in my heart inside ؎ (P-180) and that I am.My doubt ∗∗∗ and my skillful and what you have brought to the fingers of your love and the ingredients as if they were ∗∗∗ the craving of the tea that the mercy and Abu al -Fateh are the son of the son of the son of the name.As if it was meaning that it is an indication of the extent of the same way, and its ability to do the ways of his words, how will he want, as the courage is in the field of elimination.And “you” is the guarantee of a discourse in the case of fixing and the appearance that the word “that“ it was made to be entrusted with it.When his separation, and for that, it is necessary for the bridle, Nahu: And from you the adherence to warning because the guerrillas separated when the worker is obligated.And from the grammarians, who made a single bid, a single condition, and made the bridle with which it was added to him for confirmation.And among them who made (Eh) is the guerrilla and made after it a forefather for the signs of the guerrilla.And among them who made (Eh) a dormant to the guarantee, as it was any of the benefits of the club in which he (the).And among them who made (Eh) a phenomenon added to the guarantees.And worship is a verb that indicates subconscious or excessive overflowing between the two of the people.As for its release on obedience, it is metaphor.And worship in the law is more special, so it is recognized that it is the act of the Lord of submission, compliance, and abstinence, or it is the verb of the cost of the affliction of his soul, and he said: Al -Razi in the interpretation of his words of transgression and what I created in heaven and humanity except to worship [Al -Dhariyat: 56] The worship preaching the command of God and the companionship of creation.This meaning is the one who agreed upon the partnership, and if they differed in the place, the loudness, the less and the abundance of the ech, this is the interpretation that includes the compliance.The Sufis was interpreted by worship by doing what satisfies the Lord.And the servants of the satisfaction with what the Lord does.It is stronger.Some of them said: The slave is the one who is the one who is the struggle, and the conservation of the limits, and the satisfaction with the supplies.And patience is on the inconsistencies, and this is a disorder that is not crushed in it.Al -Fakhr said the paths of worship three: The first is for God to worship in the reward and fear of punishment, which is worship, and it is a degree of falling down because he made the right to make the truth Repeated.The second is to worship God for the sake of honoring His servants and affiliation with him with the acceptance of his crocodiles, and it is higher than the first except (P-181) that it is not complete.With the same as God.The third is that God worships Him for Him, a deity, afflicted with worship, and his being is his servant, and this is the highest of the maqamah, and he is the name of the slave.I said, and the imam was not named the third, in the name of the third, and the most prominent is that it is attached to the name of the third soil.The truth is not something other than it, and it does not affect anything on its nations and worship it for it only, and because it is entitled to worship, and because it is a vulnerability, there is no evil Ahhouh, uh.For bonds and fear is the one who called Islam in the brochure of his guidance, and she is the one who has the believer's gathering and is the end of the cost, how And he said: “God fears his servants of the scholars [Fattar: 28].The note of fear and the greed in many conditions, yes, if the nation is virtuous, they are different in needing to disagree and dearest to the destruction of the virginity And its reconciliation and their recession in the ability to be in their vicinity, and with that, they have no restriction from the return to fear in many conditions and the greed.And the greatest indication of what we said is that God Almighty praised in his book, who are righteous in the positions of a whole and called for piety, and is piety except their name in the meaning of the fear of the fear And they hope for his mercy and fear his torment, that the torment of your Lord was a warning [Al -Israa: 57] and the third aspiration is the one who pointed to it is his saying to whom he said: The worship has forgiven you, God has forgiven you, what you have given from your sin and what you have delayed, and he said, "Do you not be a servant of thanks?" The soul has the same in the increase in the increase, because the general forgiveness has obtained it, so the skepticism for the sake of the complaint is not other than that, and it is not possible.(P-182) He knows that one of the most important pharaohs is searching for the secret of worship and its effects and the secret of its entrepreneurs His attributes are high: existence, knowledge, and ability.He made the acceptance of the human being for the levels that are described by the levels of his knowledge of his knowledge and his ability to know the knowledge The excess of the perfection will be increased, so that it will be unnamed by what he has reached the paths in the wage of the kinship and the knowledge, and guide him and guide him to what he uses for him to do so to him.The urgent is a telegram that does not include, and made it inventory the acceptance of all the goods, all of which are urgent and later, standing on the delivery of the travel to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is revealed to them.And when this is standing on the monitoring of the soul in its alienation and evils, and that monitors needed to remember the reward for good and against it, and the slander of the servants of the servants of the servants of the slave of the servants of the good That is the metaphor, because the presence of himself and his admiration for the sacrifices of the majesty leakes his forgetting to spontaneity, as he made his regime in this world, and the one who is connected.He commanded them to the necessity of the etiquette of the manifestations and the treatment, so that the regime does not spoil, and to keep the wounds of that, as well as the worship of the servants to remember it The perpetrator of the creator and his affairs, and in that creation with tawaaf, is a reasoning, so it appeared that worship is the way of the dhikat and the sociology of the principle of principle The meaning of its saying is clear and what I created in the jinn and humanity is only to worship [the dhikr: 56].The secret of the creation and the absence of it was the hidden awareness of God, God Almighty has known it with its appearance and what it achieves as a group of the great suffering in one sentence, and it is a sentence that is a sentence, and it is a sentence of this The report that we have erased and less than the saying of Sheikh Ibn Sina in the references, when the human being did not, in which he is independent of the same matter His genesis, with a mandate, and opposition, and they will empty each of them, for his companion, for a miserable, if he assumed it with the same one, and he was not over.It is difficult if I can, and it is necessary to be among the people and a justice that a law preserved by a long -standing, unique, distinguished by the achievement of obedience, and it is necessary The estuary is a reward for the expert, so the knowledge of the reward and the hurry is required, and that it is with the knowledge of a preservative because of the knowledge of the knowledge, so it is the same.The remembrance of the servants, and it was repeated to them to reserve the memory of the freshness.There is no doubt that the reason for the worship of worship and the abuse, and it is either a love or for a prestigious fear (P-183) and its importance was what was loved; Because he is satisfied with the same actor, he said: ؎ Your fear is the best and what you have is able to do it, but the fullness of the eyes of its love, and it is the abandonment of the fear of the people, who is the one who is a fool, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a ward Or the publication of al -Fiqiyyah: ؎ disobeying God and you show his love ∗∗∗ This is my life in the measurement of the sake of the sake of you if your love was honest, I will obey it ∗∗∗ that the love is for you He said: Say: If you love God, then follow me, God will love you [Al -Imran: 31] So that he feels that following the project is obligatory and that the love of God is the love of God Habib, as the singer said: You are the beloved, but I seek refuge in it ∗∗∗ from being a lover, and it is not loved, and to this type, you return the worshipers of the servants The hidden in all the parties because it is a building on the love of God Almighty, and the servants of the traders also said: The Almighty said: Like the love of God [Al -Baqarah: 165] and from the nations who worshiped for fear without love, but it is for evil meeting, as you worshiped some of the nations of the slaves and worshiping (Harmin) He has the Lord of evil and the harmful and they are symbolized by the victory of the darkness and that he was born from the mind of badness, the Lord of the Lord, he said: They increase the eloquent ∗∗∗ Feape of its thinking and the exclusivity that benefits from the presentation of the work in the saying of the Almighty: “Do you worship” The one who is cursed for this praise is only worshiped God.Ibn al -Hajib claimed to clarify the detail in the explanation of the detail of the detailed when the saying of the Zamakhshari, “God is Ahmad” that the adherence is not to benefit except for the sake Exalted: “Do we worship” He has the religion [Al -Zumar: 2] and the heroes of his opinion are determined in the books of the knowledge of the suffering.And I see the exaltation of his saying, “He worshiped God [Al -Zumar: 2]” He does not fit his scientific status, as he does not think that the status of the words is similar in all of you A beautiful sentence on the sentence of “you worship”, but it was not separated from the sentence of “you worship” with the way of preparing the sentence of the place And repeat each or some of the references to the actual risk of all in the will of those who speak to this specialization, that is, your specialization (P-184) with the same With worship.And use to seek help.The eyes and the insistence are the same as the verb of something that is difficult and difficult for the one who is alone, so it will obtain a way of the way you get it from the loan of the family of the family, Like bearing and possibilities, or with a saying, such as guidance and teaching, or in opinion like a shout.Al -Hariri said in the residence, “And a good -mindedness”, or with the payment of the heat, in which the matter will obtain the matter of the efforts of the users.As for the use of God, it is the request of the one who is not before, to be good at the insult to Him, and there is no kissing for the one who is helping to be in the authority of it.The one who sides distracts his estimation to obtain the verb and asks God to help him to facilitate what is not before the ability This is the one who is a law and the scholars have made it that it is the creation of what it has to do the act of the verb or its facilitation, so the division of two parts is divided by any So it does not get its body, that is, it does not get the affection of its attachment, which is to give the admission to the risk and conceive it for the verb and the obtaining of the material, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the subject of the matter, the subject of the matter, He expresses it with obedience, and expresses it in peace the causes and machines, and with it, it is correct to expand the apprehension.The second oath is not the same and it is devoted to the name of the enemies, which is the finding of the one who is facilitated by the verb for the one who is the one who does not know The travelers are in traveling to the walk on walking.By joining this meaning for the first meaning, the right to fulfill the knowledge that is the creation of the ability and the preacher to the obedience, and the name of the ritual is called the ritual.By fulfillment and does not oppose between his words and between their awareness Do not know that it is only after obtaining the first meaning, so the fulfillment is fulfilled; The intended here is the use of all important verbs, which are above the consequences That is from the argument of virtue.And the century of this intended drawing is in the opening of the book and the fall of the specialization of the success of the specialization of worship.Therefore, the attachment of the one who has the right to the one who has the right to remind the bitter of the authority, and this important deletion benefited the generalities of the use of the abuse of With him, the Almighty, and from the goods of that and its causes, which are acquaintances, guidelines, and the partnerships, and the origins of the science The bouquets assigned us and our pneumatic codified, he said: Did we not make him two eyes [Al -Balad: 8] and for two lips [Al -Balad: 9] and we guided him to the help [Al -Balad: 10] and the first is the first The sensors, the top of which are insights, and the second is a gesture to (P-185), the penetration and the Bayan for learning, and the third to the bouquet.And the limited limitation of the progress in its saying and that we seek a preyed confinement for the lag of the language for the number of people who are in the interest of the mandar Some in their affairs, and the meaning of the exclusivity here we do not seek help from the great things that the people do not seek in them except by God Almighty.This shortness is beneficial in them, which is to be broken by the traders who worship others, and they seek help from it, because they were two of them, who are the best of them.The partnership, except that his followers and his abuse, without God, have forgotten the servants of God, as they worshiped the sun and worshiped the chair Al -Faraa, and the nations of Sudan worshiped the tallness as the people.And from the participants who have been blessed with the worship of God, the worship of others, and this is the case of the greatest of the Arabs from the servants of idols or the servant of the curtains, so he did not worship The kinna of the moon worshiped, and worshiped the loyalty, the Khazua, and some Quraysh al -Shu`ri, and the waters of the Dabran worshi They approach it to God Almighty, so they gathered the worship and use them to make them a luster to God, beating from the use of us The participants and the like with the way of exposure, that is, with the way to present the words, because the true palace is not valid for the response of the belief that it is not possible that it is not possible for it to be.The truth is as the Slavi referred to it in the footnote to interpretation.If you say how to command us that we will not worship except God and do not seek help It is according to it that this verse refers to it, and it was replied in the correctness, “The Prophet ﷺ when Abdullah bin Abbas taught to him, then he asked him, then ask God, then ask God.” So he did not come with a palace formula, I said: The Sheikh mentioned the grandfather, God sanctified his soul in his relationship with this hadith that you leave the way of the shortness The polytheism, and that it is the right of the question to be only for God, the knowledgeable.The scholars of the rhetoric said if the action was incompatible with itself, then the composition of the palace of the palace of the words of the words uh.And I say a stand on the impact of it that the place of the hadith is other than the place of the verse.On the outfit of the thorme, and for that, I seek to seek it from it.The abandonment in the case of the heinous polytheism is that you depend on them in the condition of the condition on the issue of any question and any use of the benefit of the short (P-186) and with the opinions of their makers, they were sought after their gods.And that is the argument with the syntax with the gods and the idols, and the "we worship" and "we seek help", they return to the following of the surah, with the same.And in the entirety of the one who guided the one to the two speakers of the righteous, the indicative indication is that this resurrection is shocked by groups.So he is an anger of the polytheists, as they know that the Muslims became in pride and prohibitions, and because he is the most abundant in the praise of “worship” and I am helping “ Also, by the fact that the idiots are the one who has witnessed it, and they knew his virtue, and a close proximity of this is the saying of the jungle in the lament of the enemy.He has a hook ∗∗∗ and a leaving and the dumbness of the lavishness and the calamity, as he intended to prepare items from the nations of the nations of the greatness of the enemy and the many.As if the Hamid was transferred from praise to the survival, he did not leave a chance, and the praise of it was given.And the direction of his saying is that we worship it on his saying, and you seek help that worship is close to the analogy, so it is a great way.As for the use, it is for the benefit of the creature to facilitate it.The use of God is committed to his slaves to those who seek help from Him, and because one of the sentences is required to be struggled with worship, so the servants are in the way Justice.It was also obtained from that submission The similar or the relative is in the exaggeration of the tongue, and I have been returned to you in the use without being kind to the act of "we seek" on the "worshiper" As the sentence of the sentence has abandoned it, because between the two harshs is a separation, then the confinement in “I do not worship” The Muslim may help, other than God, how is it, and he said: The Almighty said, and they are on the authority of righteousness and piety [Al -Ma’idah: 2], but he does not seek help in the greatness of the affairs, and there is no one.Right, except for the use of God Almighty.
