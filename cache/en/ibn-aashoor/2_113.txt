The researcher said the Jews, the Christians are not on anything.Between them on the day of resurrection, while they were in it, they were dispersed by his saying.They are their hearts, and that the throwing of the person who violates them is that it is lost in a valuable, in which they are threw up.The Christians threw like the same, so do not like the ruling of every group of them that Muslims do not enter paradise and in that way of the people of the book and the people of the people The Muslims and the payment of suspicions from the partners that they take from the people of the book in Islam to perform an argument for themselves to be in their power.What is meant by the saying is permissible with the indicative words.Their progress (P-676) Jews came to them while they were at the Prophet ﷺ So they look at them in religion and rags them until they were cursed, so he disbelieved in Jesus, and he said: So he disbelieved the redemption of Najran in Moses and the Tawabra, and they said to the Jews, you are nothing.And their saying “on something” is a denial in the context of the negation and the opposite thing here is exaggerated, that is, they are not on something that is accustomed to it.The exile is the nude thing or by administering a row that is deleted at the limit of the saying of Abbas ibn Merdas: ؎ I was in the war that did not come I prevent any of the exile, and he did not give anything, and I have not been forbidden, and the Messenger of God was asked about the priests, and he said: They are not in the authority of the people.My speech is the denial of something that is used to in the current presentation, in which the words are based on the restaurants.There is nothing on the right and that is a seduction of the validity of the validity of what is between their hands from the Sharia book, so every kind of two parties is not from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same In it is good, as his saying after him is followed by the book, and they say it, “and they recite the book“ a clear sentence that comes from the time They say that and every group of them recite the book and every book that they recite is uncommon for the truth, if it follows its people, the right to follow it and does not give it to the people Some of their writers or most of what is in it, so the saying of others is not believed that they are not on anything.He came to the current sentence because its indication is stronger than the connotation of the situation The individual because the current sentence is due to its disgrace on a experience of experience that it benefits that what was his right to be a definition of it from the news that it is not a good.The expert about him, so he brings him to the sitting of the case that is unable to rely on it, and he has become a mortal to him, so he became a condition for him.And the authority of his saying, “They are“ domesticated to the two parties, and it was said to the Christians because they are close to the male.And the definition in the book made it the owner of the scout made it to define the genius while he threw this that the intention is that they are the people His punishment is like that, “Those who do not know,“ The meaning is that they are attributed to the lineage (P-677) to the end of the misguidance, and they are among the people of the knowledge of those who do not know The right to be fair to show the signs of the mistake at them.And he made Ibn Attiyah Al -Taraif to the covenant and made the teeth of the supply, that is, because it is the book that the two sponsors read and the face of the pleasure of this For victory and the Gospels are a delegate with her rights, so how can the Christians claim that it is not something as it did Christians Najran.And that Al -Tuwarah is a healing with the coming of a messenger after Moses, so how is Sagh to Jews, the Messenger of the Christians.And if the guerrillas are made to the Christians in particular, it is possible that the teeth are the teeth, as we mentioned or the spoken Gospels in the truth of the teeth, and in the “Leak of this”.Because it becomes a wonder that is a harmful from the apology, it means that they read without arrang This verse is a response to the victory of one of the two parties or both of them.And his saying, “Likewise, those who do not know the same as their saying,“ That is, this is similar to this saying.The interview of those who recite the book and want them to share the Arabs, and they do not know that they are illiterate, and the release of those who do not know about the one who knows the evil The one who says the following and said who do not know if God does not speak to us or come to us a verse [Al -Baqarah: 118] with the evidence of his saying, so he said to those who are before them.[Al -Baqarah: 118] It means that the Jews and the Christians said, and the meaning here is that the participants lied to all of them, all of which are the Jewish, the Nasraniya, the Islam, and the intended from the analogy of the It is that it is similar to the saying of the people of misguidance.This is a breakthrough for the partnership of the participants, as they met with it the Islamic preacher, that is, they said to the Muslims, like the article of the people of the two writers, and the one who said the two of them.Their article in his saying, when they said what God has revealed to the good of something [Al -Anam: 91] And the likeness that is used from the cave in “as well as“ it is similar to the claim that they are not on anything and the estimation is like that, the saying that he said: They know, and this is the memorial of “the same as their saying” is a confirmation of what he has benefited sufficiently suspiciously, and he is a certainty that indicates that the similarity is among the words of the one who does not know.The saying of Jews and the Christians is a complete similarity because they said, “God has revealed to the good of something.” They lied to the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims.(P-678) The approach of the neighbor and the boundary on his attachment, and he said, either for the trusteeship of the extermination of the similar patrons, or to sing about the letter of kindness in the words of the word Performing that the perception of the symptoms is sufficient to suspect, as the suspicion is in the description.For the sake of the perpetrator, or for his increase, he affirmed his saying, “Likewise,“ with his saying ”, like their saying,“ It is also a row for the work.” Like their saying.And to make you "as well" for the same as their saying and consider its progress from the last and the first appearance.The owner of the scouts and a group was permissible for him to be his saying, “The same as their saying” or his saying, “Likewise,“ I am sure of the last and that it is a reference to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And from his chests on the authority of his chest, and the recovery of the same to the same in the memorizers, so he will be on his words as a disturbance in the suspicion of the two sides of the two sides.And his saying, “God rules among them.It is caused by it, and it is a news that is intended for the goodness and the feast, and the guarantee is the one who is in addition to the one who returns to the three teams and what they were in it.Shamwah.
