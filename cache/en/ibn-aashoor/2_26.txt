The Quranic researcher is that God is not ashamed to strike for example a mosquito, so what is on the authority of it may appear in the view of the view of the proportionality between the arms of the verses of the righteous and the arms The precedent verse was a praise for this book shown, and described the states of those who are guided by his guidance and the evaluation of his paths, and to the sake of his miracle, and the one who will be with him, with what he will be with him The sermons, the beneficial times, the painful nostrils, and the wonderful representatives, if in the words, it came with the news that God is exalted, and he does not know that he will be rewarded.It is true in the view of the contemplation that the occasions appear for him for this resignation: so that the precedent verses were seen on the end of the ritual that they will come to me.The Qur’an, and when they were rewarded for the opposition of the organizer, they walked in the opposition to the way of stab Let them reach this to the heights (P-358) that the Qur’an be from God with the meeting of the doubt in the souls of the believers and the seed of the character in the alienation of the two and the two parties.The one narrated in the causes of the descent from Ibn Abbas that God Almighty is when he said that those who call from God without God will not create flies, and if they are fool The flies are something that they do not save from it [Hajj: 73] and its saying is the same Any thing is made by this, so God is revealed that God is not ashamed to strike for example a mosquito, so what is above it and narrated from the good and the murmur of God, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good His book, and the example of which he laughed at you, and said: What is similar to that this is the words of God, so God revealed that God does not be ashamed of the verse.And the face is that we collect between the two narrators and explain what they have been overwhelmed with that the two participants were overwhelmed by Juda, who was raised in the rituals of the After that, the prophet ﷺ to the city, and they will receive a picture of the good and the preoccupation, so the two sponsors may appear on the stabbing in the rhetoric of the rhetoric And the flies, when God sent down the transgression of the hypocrites of the one who lost a fire, and their greed from the Jews, whose conversations were arrested and their necks were lost.He was attributed to him in one of the two narrators, and the verse came down to the response to the two parties, and the morning clarified for two eyes.It is necessary that that was said by the scholars of Jews who have no luck in rhetoric, or they said it with their knowledge with the art of the rituals of the proverbs, and it is justified.And the two sayings of the Jews are the agreement to be the surah.In the city, and the most obsessive in which they are the Jews, and because it is the most horizontal with the words of the Almighty and what is misleading of it except the evildoers who are the one who will be covered, and the righteousness of God, and the righteousness of God Jews have spread among them the pessimism and the righteousness in the caution of the signs of the righteousness until they were famous for the accusations of the words directed by the insult and the custody of the words.He changed those who have been wronged from them, as they were said to them [Al -A'raf: 162] as he wanted his interpretation in the correctness, and that was not from the matter of the Arabs.Either it is the one who is the one who is the one who has the people of Mecca with their knowledge of the likeness of his likeness in the words of their linguistics as their saying: I am a butterfly, and weaken from mosquitoes.And this involvement is evidence, that they did not say: What is this (P-359) representation?Except for perseverance and suffering, as they were overpowered by the limit and they were rewarded for the two walls of the same as they were attached to their excuses with the signs of the sake He is hidden, and the wicked rituals seek the straight and hide the clear, and to this second, the words of the owner of the scouts are removed, and he woke up.And the surah, and if it is a civilian, then the two participants are still throwing the similarity in the authenticity of the message and they will be after the migration by the midst of the hypocrites.This meaning has indicated his saying after it, but those who believe, know that the truth is from their Lord, and for those who disbelieved to the saying of it, and it is the saying of it The response was not the success of the verses in which the representatives are the one who denied it, so the house is in response Time for a long time.We said: The face is in the last of its descent to fall into the response after the two admirers with admirational ideals that are required by the place that the bodies liken to, so that it is as long as it is forbidden So the dwelle of the dawn of the tear of the stinging, or the budget will be delayed from the battlefield, and it is a good thing to be given to it, so the first people will be pleased with it, so the first will be pleased with the soul of the soul.So he gives him a generous gift, and the second is until he is a period that will be the judge over his wife.So, when the Qur’an came with the greatest and pride of the proverbs, and it is the same as the same as the example [Al -Baqarah: 18] This came in response to them, so this shows you the occasions of the descent of this verse, which is before it, and he has disappeared.What is meant by the likeness is the similarity, and it is not the same They stabbed him in the similarity of the Qur’an, like his saying, and they will not create flies [Hajj: 73] and say it as the same It is signed that here is clear.As for those who are supported by a flag without it other than the attributes, because this flag is a gathering for all the attributes of the fullness, so his remembrance of it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the most words A truth in the observance, and in that also heroes to vote for them by the fact that the Qur’an is like this, such as this is an indication that it is not from the one who does not It is for him to be able to strike for example from this tribe.This is also the choice of the chain of transmission, the deed of the act of the consequences, an increase in the response to them, because they denied the representation of the things of the things of the things, as well This is a warning from the imminent as we will show it (P-360), so they will be careful that the Creator is not ashamed of that, as it is not what he is ashamed of, and because the misfortune is in the way On the basis of its creator and the behavior in it, and the remembrance of the impermissibility is here, as a simulation of their saying, but the Lord of Muhammad is inspired by the Lord.If you say: If the use of these indicative conservatives on the suffering of a vastness is not violated by rhetoric, then what we see is a lot of the people of the criticism, as we have the words of what we have.For an example, as the saying of Al -Farzdaq: ؎ Whoever has gone a stone with a house, as if they had a lump Ignorance ∗∗∗ And you are gone from the lightness of you, and the saying of the ritual: Literary criticism is interpreted to the Bayan of what is not good for him to complicate the words of the writer from the side of the industry of words, and from the side of the pictures of the suffering, and from the side The third type is different from the disagreement of al -Awadid and your minds and the rally of understanding according to the majority A people other than an acceptance at the last two, and an acceptance in an exhibited era, other than it, not to see it to the saying of the jungle, the king addresses the enemy: ∗∗∗ And if I give up that the one who gave you a wideness, then the king likens it to the night, even if it was signed in the time of the births, so it is no longer from the estrange Advance and enemy in the saying of the sauce: ؎ The virginity of those who are enemy ∗∗∗ They were the neighborhood of the earth and the saying of the jungle in the lament of the height of the heaven Remembering a rising with the invasion of the righteousness of the origins, and some of the people of the literature may be granted that Ali ibn al -Jahmah praised the cruelty of the deceased.And like the rhythm of the engagement (P-361), and that when Baghdad lived and commented on the people of people, he said in The first of what he said: They are aware of the equivalent between the righteous and the bridge.He did not see it, and he said.As if her bones were from Khazran and likened to the servant of Abd al -Hayyah in his saying: ؎ As it was when she walked ∗∗∗ A name that is used in many, the impermissible, the neighborhood, and the neighborhood, and the neighborhood, and the neighborhood, and the neighborhood, and the neighborhood, For the lame, the same is the same as a resignation, the delay, and the admiration.It is the passion of the soul from the breasts of action or its delivery to the sensitivity that it does not fit or does not improve in the knowledge of his voices, so it is a form of exposure to the soul of the soul Its effect appears on the face, and in the imams on the authority of it to do.And the fragmentation here is exile from being a description of God Almighty, so he does not need to be interpreted in the health of his chain of transmission to God, and the reason for this is that we have the exile Al -Tawfiq is an uncomfortable.And the harm in its saying is to strike a similar way to work in place and make it from their saying: He was a client and a house.Abda bin Al -Tabib said: “He who was a migrant house ∗∗∗ with the woven of the soldiers was exaggerated, and it was ghoul and the saying of the Farzdaq: And the descending book has eliminated it, that is, he made something like any likeness.The one who has the same, and the permission of some of the imams of the language to be the verb of a derivative (P-362) of the warning in the sense of similar, so it is an example of the same.To be sure that an example is an extension of his action on this estimation, and the meaning: it is not possible to resemble something.The ideal and similar example, and he was overwhelmed by a form, and may be presented with the saying of the highest example of them as the example He set the example in the other sense, and denying (example) to show the two villages of his two words with his saying (mosquitoes), so what is lost.And what is a thumb is connected to the denial, so it is affirming its sequence, dilemma, or contempt, as a result: for something, and gave it something.The appearance is that it is a further to be its indication of the affirmation is more severe, and a name was said in the sense of the vague denial.And with a mosquito, or a bay, one of its saying is a single mosquito, and it is a small, shed, fierce, with a minute, which is dumped on the human being, who is a foolishness of the human being.Food for it, and it is known in the language of this gossip, and the people of Tuns, whom the law is called and one of the laws was made, and it was made here an example of the hardship.And what he said is what So it was composed of mosquitoes and origin (above) is a name for the place that is attached to others, so it is a soapy name, so it was a mandate for the addition of the addition to the addition of the addition of the addition of the addition of the addition of the addition of the addition of the addition In the name that is added to it, it is one of the names of the mandatory flaws to the addition of the memorization or the ability, and it is used as a metaphor in the argument, otherwise it is in a row in the righteousness.With the appearance of the one who is overwhelmed by something that is overwhelmed by it, so it is like it is used in the sense of dominance and the leadership in the description of the name Mass, it is said: so -and -so, so that it is a spoiler, and the brave and above the courage, and say that I give, so that it is above his right, that is, an increase in his right.In this verse, it is good for the two meanings, that is, more than the mosquitoes in the contempt and what is the greatest of the argument.And his counterpart is the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “There is no Muslim who doubts a thorns, so what is on the authority of it, except for it, is written for it with a grave and is wiped out of it by sin.” The thorn in the harm is like the nickname - as it came in another hadith - or what is more severe than the thorn, like the tingling with a knife, and this is from the way of the words of the word His choice in this verse was without less, and without the most powerful proverb, such as a satellite than the briefing.(P-363) The loyalty is a subject that is based on a mosquito, which has been shared by their participation in the harm of the example with them, and its right to benefit the structure and the punishment, but it is not, but it is not here It was used in the sense of exhaustion between the rituals (to be hurt) and does not benefit that the coercion of the proverb is with mosquitoes and the punishment of it with what is the same The example is that the mosquitoes and what is traumatized in the paths of power are increased by a degree, followed by a degree.A subject to the punishment that is a special contact, so it was used in the divorce of communication, or it is a slogan for the perpetrator because it is a young man in the case in the case in the case in the case in the case in the case of the disturbance in the case The punishment is delayed in the acquisition, and from it: may God have mercy on the two rumors and the short.The meaning is that the mosquitoes will be set for example, so that it will harm what is above what is the other degree, that is, the most severe of the mosquitoes, like the atom, and the greatest of it is the same.* * * As for those who believed, they know that the truth is from their Lord, but those who disbelieved will say what God wanted with this, for example, the fulfillment of the slander To punish the detailed words of the beautiful words, the one who is able to say it is not ashamed because it is unable Believers, disbelievers, and both of the two parties receive that ideal and dispersed their condition in the integrity with it, we grew up in the words, an estimated boredom that is required.Rather, he was kind In fulfillment that detailing has a pungent.And (as for) is a subject of separation of a summary or an estimated.And when the scattering required consulting the honorable to detail it, the confrontation was to separate it with a house of supplication, as if the speaker says: So the separation of Kit and Kit, so she (either) was included in the meaning of the condition, and for that, the fulfillment was required in the sentence that after it, so that it is like it.On the meaning of detailing in the privacy of the saying of the Arabs: As for after you are prepared for the condition, and that is in the verification of the meaning of detailing, because it is the meaning Speech after his first words.Sibuyeh estimated it in the sense of what is of anything, and the people of the Arabism after it and after it while it is possible for me to be able to correct it, and in the way of the family, and in the entry of the Something (P-364) because the pretext of the purpose of the condition of the condition is not clear, then if it comes with the tool of detailing the meaning of the condition, the condition is the same With that detail, he benefited the strength of the words that the adulterers were called for sure, and it is only the connotation of the fulfillment of the words, that it is not true, and it is not true.With this, the virtue of his saying appears, but those who believe, know that, etc.And the detailing of people in this verse made two divisions because people are on the basis of the legitimacy and the revelation of the virtues: a believer and a disbeliever, and the one who is unbeliever is from the one Praise be upon them with the precursors of their faith and the ease of those who wanted to meet the doubt about them, so they know that their hearts are not entered into that doubt.What is meant by those who disbelieve here is either the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is overwhelmed by the Qur’an, or what includes them and the obstacle is based on what is wrong with the rituals.Rather, it was crossed in the side of the believers with (they know), exposing that the disbelievers, but they said what they said, stubbornness and perseverance, and that they know that this is the same, so that it is the same.And the people of the Bayan, but the old man is to say what is not believed; Virtue and stubbornness.And Zeid is that he is a proverb.And the right to return its suffering to the agreement of the thing because it is entitled to fall, which is here to agree to the injury and rhetoric of speech.And from their Lord is a state of (the truth) and (from) a severity, that is, and more than God, not, as those who disbelieve have claimed that it is contrary to the right, so it is permissible from the one who is from the words of the words.And the origin of what is a compound word from what is the sectarianism and the name of the sign, and for that origin was to ask about it for something referred to it as the saying of the saying, “What is the saying of“ what ”is what is“ His saying: What is this, otherwise that the Arabs expanded in it, so they used it as a name Curtain from two words and that where the referred to it is expressing it with another memorial, other than the sign until the signal will become with him with the abundance of it.For the abandonment of confirmation, we have what the heavily, or where the signal does not have a signed, and what is they upon them if they believe in God [Women: 39] Like this composition.And they may expand in it a stronger and make a name that is connected, and that is when the questioner will be known to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one It is a sentence or its part of it is a link and make it a connection to what your Lord has sent down [Al -Nahl: 24] and on these two others, the one who is good is the one who is good.His Arabs are an effective if he is a verb.And the understanding is here, i.E.The words are made in the image of the question (P-365), as it is based on the denial, because the disguised thing is that it is understood from it.The confession in denial is before the kinya, and the same is not answered by something that is mostly because it is not intended by the recovery.It may be observed in it its original meaning, and it is answered with an answer that the Kinary residency is not prevented from the will of the original meaning as his saying, “The Almighty, who is the one who wonders [1] [The Prophet: 2] Referring to his saying with this is useful for the compassion of the revelation of the place as the saying of this, this is the one who remembers your gods [the prophets: 36] The distinction is from (this) because it is a vague, so it is true for him, and it is the distinction of the distinction of the guarantee in their saying (his Lord is a man).* * * He is misled by many and guides him with a lot and what is misleading of it except the evildoers who pass the covenant The earth is the first of those who are the losers and the interpretation of the two sentences that are on the way The meaning of the two prevailing sentences is a wardrobe, because the knowledge of the believers is that the truth is one of their Lord, this is a gift, and the saying of the disbelievers (what God has wanted) There is a lot of him and guides him with a lot of answer to the questioner in the saying of those who disbelieve what God wanted with this, for example, because that is not a sense of my right.It is permissible to make an answer about their understanding of them, as a way to the words of the wise, with the bearing of their understanding of them on his backs, that he will be on the authority of the one who wore it on the authority of it.On the rule of what God wanted to do these ideals, then he will be a saying that he will have a lot and guide him with many answers to them, and to them, and for the sake The understanding that he accepted from it is the denial of the denial, as I taught it a nose from the abode The collection of the two Kinary and original meanings.And the two of the two parties are among the majestic and the righteous, many of it, it is not contradictory to its saying, and a little of my servants of thanksgiving [Saba: 13] because it is the power of the The form of the exaggeration, specialized in the feud.(P-366) The immorality is a memorial of the project, the origin of which is an effective name of immorality by breaking the fulfillment, and the truth of the immorality is the fruit of the fruit from its peeling, and it is a peel, and it is a peel, and it is a peel, and it is a ram A slave is a slave that is considered a medication, such as what the naps said: الم The small nuclei is a place that is not peeled if the peeling of the dates flew from it, and they said: This meaning is until the Qur’an was transferred to the elderly from the command of God, the Almighty, with the adoption of the tin of the cabinets, so he fell after that in the words of the Muslim: ؎ Wasfi from its intention of its a while ∗∗∗ it is angry in a glory and the abnormal and the immorality is a lot of rituals that reach each other to the infidelity.The immorality was released in the book and the Sunnah on all of it, but it is that it is saved from the collection between the evidence, it is what the people of the Sunnah have broken down on it The immorality is other than the disbelief, and that the sins, even if they do not remove faith, which is the truth, and God called Jews in many places of the Qur’an, And his dear son is a lot of the vigor from the interpreters.And the chain of transmission to God is the Almighty in which he was the one who enabled those who are lost from the gain and the choice with the creation of the minds and what he had for the causes of the good.And in the choice of his chain of transmission to God, the Almighty is with his chain of transmission because of the effective verb, indicating that it is a misguidance that enables their souls until it became like a mountain in them Their interest, as the Almighty said to God for their hearts.All of them are guided, and it is an empty issue from it in the science of speech.And his saying and what is misleading of it except the evildoers is either marketed to the two people that immorality has an effect in the increase of misguidance, because immorality is shown to the hearts and the slander of the darkness The time was fired after the other after the punishment, until it becomes a dirt.And this is the authorization of the recitation of the derivative, if it is intended for it here the derivative meaning, as if it was said: these are the pastures, and there is no possibility With the confirmation of immorality on the part of the subordination of the subordination of the murmur, or it is marketed to the way that the misguidance and immorality are brothers, so that one of them is fulfilled, and the one who fulfilled the one who fulfills the We are the same as the measure of equality, if he wants from the immoral meaning of the famous burner, so it does not have an indication of the misery.Either because of the misguidance (P-367) The adaptive in the denials of ideals is an addition with a stupor, so it is only from the Jews, and they have known this description.And the saying in the doctrine of the scholars of Islam in immorality and its influence in faith is not the place of his two as it is not the intention of the verse.If the evangelist who is the one who is the one who is the one who is involved and the Jews who stabbed the example of the proverb, the palace was in his saying, and what is misled by the one who has been lost to the one who has been in the etc.It is characterized by what is meant from the misguided and the guided.And if the evangelist who is the one who is the slave is a rhetoric, that is, a lot of misleading it, and they are the one who is the one who appears in it and the most evil is a delusion that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is misleading, I am distant from the book because they are in their partner, and the Jews are the people of a book and their affairs are to know the fans of the books of the heavenly and the rituals of them The delusion, as if it is not delusional.And the sentence of those who pass to the last of the last of the evildoers to the acknowledgment of their fairness with immorality, because his devotion is one of the greatest kinds of kindness Come here.It is permissible to be a compassionate, and that those who begin and say that these are the losers who are news That is the way; As the navigator, when he responded, the story of a state of the evildoer is appointed in the ruling of the rhetoric, that the prayer of the prayer is one of their attributes and their conditions for the fantasy of the universal Otherwise, the words are cut off, and there is no one among the people, except for the disagreement of the Arabs, and the meaning is appointed, so his expression was a righteousness, no more likely to be more like Cut.And the coming of the communication here is for the definition of what is meant by the evildoers, that is, the evildoers who have known this three, so the appearance is that what is meant is from the one who is the one This description is upon them in the positions of the Qur’an, and they have known what the connection of the connector was indicated, as we will show it here, but they have witnessed it.Their prophets that they have passed the covenant of God again, and they have recognized themselves with themselves, so it is appropriate to make the ablution to the ritual They specialize in this that the stabbing in this example has gone into the increase in the sacrifice in Islam, so they will be a misguidance on their misguidance, the precedent in the absence of their religion Baisi, as for the partners, their misguidance does not accept the leadership, that the cow surah was descended in the city and the most response in the civil verses is to the family.(P-368) And the contradiction in the language is a fact in the dirt and the solution of what was installed and the connection, with a verb that is the verb that was in which the installation was in the opposite, To go out the piece and the burning, and it is said that the rope will be broken.He drew it, caught the spin and broke the construction.The contradiction has been used here, in the way of the pledge of the pledge, which added it to the covenant of God, and it is a slogan from the drains of the Qur’an, and it was based on what was common in the words of the Lord.It is in it and the rope of the rope, and it is a great similarity in their words, and it is the saying of Malik ibn al -Tayyhan al -Nabari to the Prophet ﷺ on the end of the obstacle: O Lord of God The people are cupping, and we are the ones who are in its vicinity, so we fear that God cherishes you and showed you that you return to your people.The wage in the words was the launch of the disconnection of the piece and the shed, and what is in its meanings on the covenant of the covenant also in their words.The prince of Al -Qais said: ؎ If you have been in my peace, then came to me and said to Labid: ؎ You did not know Nawwar that I am ∗∗∗ and the righteousness of the love of the love of it, and he said: Nawar and she came ∗∗∗ and its reasons were cut off and their arms said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ The folds of the rope to the covenant of the covenant are that they are an acting of the covenant of the covenant as a Rawyid and in a developed and treated.And the contradiction is informed in the connotation of abuse from cutting and shedding, and their grace, because in the contradiction, it is a corruption of the bike of the rope and the disappearance of the hope of it.In the contradiction, it is a symbolism to a place that is from the pioneers of the rope, so here two places are settled, and this is the last, and this is the last, and this is the last.In the knowledge of the Bayan that what is covered by the likeness of the ritual in the place, it may be used in the right meaning of the way of the way of the time For the masculine similarity in the image of the lymph, a narrative that can be similar to the ravine of the likeness to the wandering, like the proof of (P-369) Implementation of the seminar.And the misfortunes of the disobedience and the gab for the gossip in the saying of Abu al -Hamdani: ؎ When the hygiene was very tired, we were more disturbed and one of the Naba and the affliction of the hand to the nasal in the saying A wind I have revealed and a revelation ∗∗∗ as I became in the north's hand.It may be used in a metaphorical meaning if the likeness in the illegal has a narrative that can be similar to it with the nose of the likeness of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is like the one who can be We have also been analogy as well, and the ping does not spare his binding, what is to come to him, and it does not cost for it as hard as it is hard, so it is not for the sake The place is only permissible in the sentence, that is, by looking at the circumstances.This is one of the pioneers that are similar to it in the form of the place, and others may be cut off from the link with the place, so it is an independent and independent.That is where you do not remember with him a memory, which he wants to liken to, with a meal with a guarantee that is like that to say: So and so will be the same.It may be bound by the place, and that is where something is mentioned with it, which I want to like it with a similar to which it is guaranteed, as in the verse, where it is mentioned.It may be bound with a source and that is where he is mentioned with the memorial of the likeness of the one who is the one who is the one who is his saying, the saying They are their wealth, and then it will be a nomination for the perfection, and this is the interior, not opposite, as it may be valid in the position of two or all of them, but all of them Looking at the first look at the first view.And know that the narrative that is similar to it in the place if it is considered a slogan in itself, it may be deluded that its adoption is that it contradicts its aspect of the same as it is a symbol of the same When I want the heroes of the covenant, he was not among the ropes of the rope, but when he was not marked by the rope before he was heard of his memorization to the elderly Until it is contemplated in the century, such as the precedent is an indication and a symbol of the likeness of the host, so if that symbol does not get the same.Abd al -Hakim replied that his being is a cigarette after his being, based on that, when the synonymed likened him, and he was called in it, he became a custodian.And the covenant of God is what he entrusted with what he recommended to his sponsors and his preservation, and the suffering of the covenant in the words of the Arabs is many and his definition is a wedding.Al-Zajaj said, each of them said: What I know is what the covenant, and the reference of its suffering to the hostile (P-370), the preservatives, the reference and the disturbance, and I do not know which of its suffering is the origin of its origin Some of them are separated from one, and the closest is that its origin is the covenant, the source of its covenant is a covenant if you remember it and return to it as a matter of it, so that it is so that it is so, so that it is so.And my covenant with you like this, and in the hadith of the mother of a cultivation, and he does not ask what he coveted any And an evil that people do not forget, and pledged to the place or so and pledge it if it is lost and the reference spoke to it after leaving the covenant and the commandment, and from it.And the covenant of the right and the covenant is the commitment to something, it is said that it is a covenant to it and pledged to it because it is matters that the owner still remembers and takes into account it in the signs of the people.And the position that the people recovered after the distance from it was called.And the covenant in the verse that God has taken upon the children of Adam that they do not worship otherwise, did I not pledge to you, O sons of Adam, that you do not worship the Satan [Yassin: 60] And God described the two partners by breaking the covenant in his saying and those who pass The covenant of God after his covenant [Al -Raad: 25] the verse in the Surah of Raid.And it was interpreted by the covenant that God took on the
