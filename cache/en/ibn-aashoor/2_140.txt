The Quranic researcher (P-747), or they say that Abraim, hearing, Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were humiliated or Christians, say that you know the mother of God and whoever is from the one who is from the one who is from whom God, and God is unaware of what you do, or a place in the sense of the meaning of it, and it is a warrant for the resignation from the supply to the supply, and in it the appreciation To inform them of ignorance, with their parts, they claimed that Abraham and his children were on the authority of the Judaism or on Nazranism, as he said: God and the way of other verses on him, such as what he was Jewish or Nisrani [Al -Imran: 67] and the same as his saying, O people of the book, why are you not needed And the Gospel is only after it, do you not understand [Al -Imran: 65] and the nation if it is built in the ignorance and its heads became unknown, and without the arrangement, it is not possible.I gathered in the contradictory deposits, and the prophet was found ﷺ the day of the conquest in the kaaba, a picture of his burden, divided by the rituals in the kaaba, so he said: [Al -Imran: 67] To his saying and what was from the participants [Al -Baqarah: 135] And he said that God is divided with a cat.You are reasonable [Al -Imran: 65], so they will be able to mind.And he read the gathering and Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim and Rawiyeh from Yaqoub with the absence of the absent, and the son of the son of Amir, Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i, and a thunderboller of the one who is the same To say that we need us in God [Al -Baqarah: 139], so his saying is that you know, the mother of God, a second matter, after he said, say: “Do you need this?” [139] With the enjoyment, because the tafs are in conjunction with that of that.And the meaning of saying that you know the mother of God is the appreciation, and God has taught us that Abraim was not Judaic or Nisri, and this is like his saying in Surah Al -Um You need to be in Abraham, and what is revealed by the mourning and the Gospels, except after it, do you not reason [Al -Imran: 65] and I have been expanded from the report in the saying He taught them a matter of ignorance of their general and his deadlines for their own, and for that he said, and whoever darkens from those who have been a martyr who has a martyr who has a person who refers to the special and the people of the people Their nation is sent to the heads of sin, vanity and misguidance, and they are silent, and they will not change them with pleasure, and they will be trapped to them.The nation was used to its knowledge of it (P-748) and its ignorance was a science, and it did not succeed in it after that, because it sees the reconciliation, so it was not what they have come to.Our fathers found a nation, and we are on their effects They are stated * * * And whoever is darkened by those who have a martyr who has a martyr who has from God, and what God is with the heavie of what you do is from the sentence of the one who says: The prophet ﷺ that he says to them that he reminds them of the covenant who is in their books, hoping that they will seek themselves and restore the view if they are the one who is the same They were baptized.And “from” in his saying from God is a predecessor, that is, a martyr who has a rhetoric from the aspect of God on the tongue of His messengers.Waw is a sentence of a sentence, and whoever is darkened by those who have a testimony of a sentence that you know the mother of God, and this is the most accumulated.Abraham and his sons were obese or Christians, and this is not involved in them.And his saying, and what God is unaware of what you do the rest of the saying of the saying, and it is a threat because the Qadir, if it is not unaware, is not a person who has no reason for it This was presented in the positions.
