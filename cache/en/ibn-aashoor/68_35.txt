The Quranic researcher makes the Muslims, such as the criminals, what you have to judge the fulfillment Sleeping, and his interview with the threw of the partners with the torment of the world and the hereafter, but that is not what is expressed in it with what is appropriate for this to be separated from this and this is the separation of this.So the estimation of the consequences of the disposal of them is to show them to them this divine understanding, which is what we have denied to it as a nose from the signature or a question.And the understanding and the distance from the time, the mistake, and the recklessness of the false illness, the authorization that what was denied by them and the slander of it and the slander of it, and it is upon him and they were blessed with it and they were blessed with it In a hadith, they have been done in their clubs, or they will be harnessed by Muslims in the disposal of the ingratitude to be a mission, and their imposition is that it is based The Muslims have a good and virtue of his struggle.On the authority of a fighter when a verse was revealed that the righteous with their Lord is the paradise of the righteous [Al -Qalam: 34] Quraysh said: If there is a paradise in it, then we will be in it.In the world, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that they said: We are given a good day, which is given, and it is revealed, and the saying of the Muslims is like the Muslims.And the prodigy of the denial of the denial, so the denial of equality between the Muslims and the disbelievers of the precedent of the parties of the two parties, so the denial of the one who is the one who has been blessed From the saying when we descend the preceding verse or when we descend from the Qur’an that was met with the Qur’an that met between the rewards of the believers and the parties He said what you have, how do you judge him, if you do not judge [pen: 39].(P-92) The denial of making the two parties is likely to give the Muslims the reward of goodness in the hereafter and the involvement of the partners of it; Because the exile of equality is and a response in the sense of contradiction in goodness and evil in the Qur’an and the words of the Arabs said: The exalted one who was believers was a believer who was a paster who did not equate [the prostration: 18], and he said: Paradise [Al -Hashr: 20], and he said, “We will make those who believe and do righteousness like the spoilers in the land, or do we make the righteous like the displaced” [p.28] and the poison said: The people are ignorant of us and for them, so it is not a world and it is a matter.It is the case in the world with the interest of the speech of the discourse.And the saying of the Muslims, such as the criminals, is the words directed to the two participants, and they are intended by (the criminals), expressing them with the ritual of the ritual And described (the criminals) from the interview to be in the two descriptions a gesture to the exile of the similarity between The two parties.So, the guarantee of the speech was not in his saying, as you have to rule over the guarantees of the unseen from his saying, and they will not give them to them, and they will be fat.We have we [Al -Qalam: 17].Rather, the guerrilla changes to the guarantor of the discourse in order to change the rituals of the words; Because the stipulation of the tattoos is that the guerrilla changes in one context.And (what you have) is an inhabitant of the case of their judgment, (so what you have) is a beginner and a report, and you may have been presented in his saying, they said: “And we do not fight in Sayyar.” [246] The cow.And how do you judge a second denial in the position of the situation from the guarantor (for you), that is, it is that you have something in the event of your judgment, that is, if it is proven, then it is for you Their judgment.The meaning: Do not judge that you are equal to Muslims in the last part of the other.
