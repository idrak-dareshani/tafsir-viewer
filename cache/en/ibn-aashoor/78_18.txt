The Quranic researcher (P-29) The day of the chapter was a meeqaat [the Prophet: 17] on the day of the images, and you will come with.This is a way for what he said: about the great prophecy [the Prophet: 2] in which they are different [the Prophet: 3] and it is the one who is intended from the light of the conqueror, which is the one who has fulfilled it.To resign is the occasion of the remembrance of the perpetrators from its saying: to bring it with love and plants [the Prophet: 15], etc.; Because that is likened to the exaggeration of the bodies of people to the resurrection, as he said: “So we watered it with gardens and loved the harvest [Q: 9] to his saying: He is a biasy man who was punished by his saying: Let us go out with love and plants [The Prophet: 15] The verse in which he is intended from the gesture to the evidence of the Baath.The words confirm the confirmation of confirmation; Because there are heroes for the denial of the participants and their denying them on the day of the chapter.The day of the chapter: the day of the resurrection of the parts.The chapter: the distinction between the disturbing things, and its release is popular with the distinction between the similar suffering and the afflicted; So, I will be released on judgment, and he may be added to it, and it is said: The separation of the judiciary, that is: a type of chapter; Because the judiciary distinguishes the right from injustice.The parts of the works are separated among the people from each other.And the transit was made from the day of the chapter to prove two things: one of them: that between the evidences of what they did from the resurrection and the penalty, and that is the same.And secondly: the elimination among the people, while they differed in it, and what they have been accustomed to each other.And the inclusion of the verb (was) to benefit that his trust is originally in the knowledge of God, because his ruling was required by the highest that he knows and that he did not know that he did not.His meeqa.(P-30) The day of the chapter was presented, otherwise it was last in the charter wall.And the description of the Qur’an with chapter comes in the saying of the Almighty: It is a chapter saying [Al -Tariq: 13] in Surah Al -Tarq.And the meeqaat: a verb that is derived from the time, and the time: the time limited in action, and therefore it is not used for time, except for the addition of the one or the one.The meeqaat came to the adultery of the name of the machine and I want the same time that is limited to it, such as an appointment and birth, in the abandonment of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name I am derived from it.The context indicated the attachment of meeqaat, that is: it was a meeqaqa for the resurrection and the penalty.He formed it as a slightly eternal meeqaqa from achieving its struggle; As Iqti is only with the right to fall, and if it is delayed and slowed down.This is a response to their question, asking for it, and about his delay, a question from which they want to be mocking with his news.The meaning: that it is not delays and its fall is indicative of its extent.The meaning: It is not for you from what he carries us to change his life, but God is a period of time.In this, a warning to them is that it is not aware of it He gets a close relative.On the day, it is breathed into the pictures of (the day of the chapter).And it was added (day) to a sentence that is blown into the pictures, so it was installed (day) on the custody and its conquest of the conquest of Arabization; Because it was added to a sentence, the first of which is an Arab, which is the one who is harmed.And the extension of this substance is the conclusion of the details of the chapter and some of the horrors of the day.And pictures: trumpet.It is a century, a ritual that empties the medium, which is lost, some of its emptiness, and it is taken from the (P-31) wood or from the copper, in which the blowing is blown in it, and it comes out of the power to the voice of the voice of the voice.The release, and the most frequently involved in the vigor and gathering to be used to work that the commander wants to blow.And the built of (blowing) to the deputy to mark the symptoms of the acquaintance with the definition of the blowing, but the symptom is the definition of this great incident and its image.And blowing in pictures may be a representative of the supplication of people and their mission to the goodness of the gathering of the peculiarities of the separation, or the success of the To gather at the headquarters of their prince.It is permissible for a blow to which life does not know its class, because the hereafter is not the case of the world The special formation, which is the formation of the bodies after them, and the transmission of their souls in its residues.And he responded in the antiquities that the king who is entrusted with this blow is Erville, and the remembrance of that was presented again.And it is composed (you came) by fulfilling the success of the blowing of their coming to the account.And the two: the presence of the place where the walk is walking, so the two are the ones.And the deletion of what is between the blowing between the pictures and between their presence in the increase in the atmosphere of the speed of the speed of the arrival of the two, as if it gets the rituals of the ritual So you will come and come.And (wraps) is a state of guarantee (you come), and the favors: gathering a wave - by opening the fulfillment and the silence of the waw -, and Al -Fawj: the group accompanied by the people of the people who are divided by the people of the purposes.So the nations will be in favor, and the righteous and others will be in favor.The meaning: So you are divided by the nomads and groups, and this division according to the conditions, such as the believers and the infidels, and all of those are divisions and attributes.
