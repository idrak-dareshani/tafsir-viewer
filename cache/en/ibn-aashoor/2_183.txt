The Quranic researcher, those who believe, have written to you, as it was written on those before you, so that you may fear the days What God has granted to the nation, and it is one of the worshiping worship to the Zakat of the soul and its whiteness, and in that the state of the individuals is an individual individual; From it, the community is formed, and the sentence was separated from its predecessor to resign to another suppression, and it was open to you, O those who believe in what is in the call of what is in the call After him.And the saying in the sense of it was written on you and its significance on the obligatory prayer, it is a nose when it is the Almighty saying: He was written on you if you are brought to you.180] The verse.And fasting, and the fast is said: it is in the terminology of the law: a name for leaving all the greatest, all drinks and the proxies of women with a period of time, estimated by the part of the sons of the sons of the one who is the same The intention of approaching approach is a warning to closer to God.(P-155) The fast is a transmitted name from an active source, and I have a sly, and it is a ja.Fasting is called a true language, except on the leaving of every food and drink, and he is attached to it in Islam, leaving the proxies of all the women, and if it is left to one of the people or the one who is the same Women; It was not a fast as Al -Arji said: ؎ If you want to deprive you of the people, if you did, I did not feed a patch or a cold, and for fasting, there are no other things, such as the sake Emoking about the running in the saying of the naps: Likewise, it describes the frustration of the beast and its time is in the effect of the winter, as the red does not drink water for its fraud with the wet aspiring: ؎ If it is a dungeon, it is a good thing.And its fasting and the backs is that the name of fasting in the language is a truth in the leaving of the most and drinking with the purpose of the kinship.As we will remember it.And the saying of jurisprudence: The fasting in the language is the divorce of the constipation, and its release on the imams from the two desires is a junction - it is not valid; Because it is contrary to the sayings of the people of the language, as in the first place and otherwise, and the release of fasting on the blessings of the words in its saying is a story about the saying of the mother of my mother: For the mercy of a fast, I will not speak to the day.And the best.The disappearance of fasting in the verse is to define the category.That is, the sweetest fasting of fasting was written on you.The Arabs were known to fast, He came in the two of Aishah, who said: The day of Ashura was a day that Quraysh fasts in the ignorance, and in some of the narratives he said: “And the Messenger of God, and the Messenger of God.” When the Messenger of God migrated to the city and found the Jews they fast on the day of Ashura, so he said: What is this?So they said: The day of God saved him in Moses, and he said: We have the right to whispering from you, and he commanded his fasting, “So the meaning of his question is the question about the intention of Jews from his fast, do not know the origin of the fast of the fast, Ramadan was the Ramadan spear, and the Messenger of God said: “Whoever wants to fast the day of Ashura and whoever wants, he did not fast.” So the fast of Ashura is obligatory (P-156) The one who is taught to it is a known fast that increased in its prestigious Kayyid al-Qaydad al-Tadidah, its conditions and its clicks with the saying of God: His saying: Until the righteous steps of you are clear from the wicked steps from the dawn [Al -Baqarah: 187], and his saying: The month of Ramadan [Al -Baqarah: 185] A traveler is several days more [Al -Baqarah: 185], and this shows that in his saying: fasting has been written on you, the sequence of its separation in the verses after it.He obtained in the fasting of Islam what violates the fasting of Jews and Christians in the leadership of what is fasting and its in its way, and our fasting was not the same for their fasting.His saying: As it was written on those before you, you like it in the origin of the costume of what the fasting is in the entity, and the likeness is to be satisfied with it, and it is in it.The similarity that is intended in the integrity, and the intended is not from this similarity that is in the description of the fasting on what was on it with the precedent nations, but there are three purposes The likeness: one of it: the fulfillment of this worship, and the intensity of it; Because it was launched by God before Islam for those who were before the Muslims, and it was lawful to the Muslims, and that is required to frame its goodness and the abundance To receive this worship as not to be distinguished by those who were before them.The Muslims were competing in the worship as it was mentioned in the hadith, “People are among the companions of the Messenger of God They fast as we fast and believe in the pioneers of their money, “The hadith, and they love the preference of the people of the book and cut the people of the people of the people A project that said: To say, but the book is revealed to two sects before us, and if we were about their studies, we are forgiven [Al -Anam: 156] or say: For we were given from them, so he came to you with a clear one of your Lord, guidance, and mercy [Al -Anam: 157].He did not doubt that they were bothering the command of fasting, and their fast was the one They were fasting while on the day of Ashura, but they were accustomed to in it, so he was watching in their specialization from God with the fasting of God, so this is the same The Muslims, as God has attached them to the righteousness of the nations in the bound by the best of the world and the hereafter.The second syntax: that in the likeness of the two precedents, they are affiliated with those who cost them to this worship that they are aggravated (P-157) this fast; In the righteousness of other things in the difficulties, this is a plural of those who may glorify the fast from the partners, so he will prevent him and the existence of the faith He is sacked by the covenants of the era in Islam, and this is the same meaning that he said after it: days of numbers [Al -Baqarah: 184].The third syntax: the excitement of condolences for the fulfillment of this satisfaction until they are not deficient in the acceptance of this symptom, but to take it with the time The precedent.And he signed for Abu Bakr bin Al -Arabi in Al -Ardah, his saying: It was from the words of your money in the way of our fasting that it was the same as fasting from us and that is what he said: On those before you, and in which there is a search, we will be exposed to him when the interpretation of his saying is the Almighty: God knows that you were the one who did not seek.] [187] This verse is based on the fast of Ramadan, because the verb “written” indicates the beads, and the convergence of the descent of the cow of the cow was in the beginning The fast of Ashura was presented for a year, then Ramadan was imposed in the year he followed, and in the correctness: “The Prophet ﷺ fasted the nine floods.The migration, and the fasting of Ashura has been imposed for a year only, and it is the first year of the second year of the migration.والمُرادُ بِـ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ مَن كانَ قَبْلَ المُسْلِمِينَ مِن أهْلِ الشَّرائِعِ, وهم أهْلُ الكِتابِ - أعْنِي اليَهُودَ - لِأنَّهُمُ الَّذِينَ يَعْرِفُهُمُ المُخاطَبُونَ ويَعْرِفُونَ ظاهِرَ Their affairs and they were overwhelmed by them in the city, and Jews had a fast that God imposed on them, and he is the fast of the day, from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from When they are (walking), the fast begins from the ninth day to the ninth day of the tenth day, and it is the day of the disbelief of the sins, and they call it (the pride of them).Other days, which are the first days of the most popular, fifth and fourth of the most beautiful and the most beautiful of their years For their dialects from the king of the king of the dwathers, I will not be in a satellite (Istir) and they have the fasting A day, "As for the Christians, they are not in their project a text on the legitimacy of an excessive fast on what is in Al -Tawarah, so they followed the fast of the Jews, and in the authenticity of a Muslim on the authority of Ibn Abbas, “They said: O Messenger of God, if the day of Ashura will be glorified by the ritual They started the fast of four days, to be greeted by the Christ, as he fasted forty days before his mission, (p-158) and it is prescribed for them, and the ritual of the ritual is the rituals of the ritual They are toured in the adjective of fasting, for they have left the forces and the evils, or is it one food in the day, it is permissible for it to be attached to it.And his saying: Perhaps you will fear the ruling of fasting, and what is for the sake of a law, so it is in the power of the verb for the sake of it for (the book) “Ki” is a liking, either by the likeness of God in his will from the legitimacy of the fasting fasting, in the case of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not do so It is the breakthrough of sins, but the fast was due to the meeting of sins; Because sins are divided; A department that is tracked in the blessing of thinking, such as wine, facilitation, stealing, and branching, so he left it.A section that arises from medical references, such as matters that are arising from anger and from the medical desire that may be difficult to leave with the deception of the deception, and the deception of the thought, so that it is the time To meet it; Because it adjusts the medical forces who are the reason for those ticks, so that the Muslim will be seen by the lamentation With the royal lines and the dust of the biological cadres.And in the authentic hadith “fasting is a paradise”, meaning: a period of time, and when it is left with the remembrance of the (paradise), his pregnancy is appointed to what he reconciles from the categories of the ritual The fasting is a severity of the fall in the restlessness, and a resurrection of the fall in the torment of the hereafter, and a resurrection of the heart and the arrival of the arrival of excessive excessiveness of the pleasure of the pleasure; And the saying of the Almighty: days of numbers [Al -Baqarah: 184] A kind of fasting, like your saying: the elderly of the day His saying: (As it was written) to (you fear) because the chapter was not in my foreigners when the investigator, for the situation and the effective for the sake of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from The launch of the worker in it, and it is the saying of “fasting”, and from the perfection of the worker in that worker, which is (written), for the worker in the thing is a worker in that thing, and the palace The work is a difference, because of their expansion in the circumstances, and this is the choice of the gospel, the time, and the satisfaction, and the reference of this question to the avoidance of the words of the word The well -known, to avoid the perfect complexity.And the majority of the states of the nations in its ignorance, and a special The Arabs are the abundance of the dedication of the sake of the foods and the wins and the fun of the women and the preacher, and all of that provides the generous powers and the blood (P-159) in the bodies, in the bodies, in the bodies, in the bodies, in the bodies.The vocabulary of the human force from the human force and the angry force.And they want the rational power, so the bouquet came on the ritual of fasting; Because he fulfills these powers of these powers, as he holds the human being from the proliferation of the influences of their excesses, so that it is a result of it in its eagerness in the stories of it.Other lanes.And fasting in the sense of the abuse of food from the food that is informed of the length of the food, which is leaving some of the food, the origin of a valid one of the origins The echoes, and the rule of the iconic it is based on the zakat of the soul by removing the pillar of Bahimiya from it with the amount of the possibility, based on the fact that the human being has two people: A broadcaster in its decision from the inner senses, and the other is a vitage in its declaration of all Jesusan members, and when the food was left to the body of what is left of the body, it is left to the body of what is left for the body Hayyanism is a wasting force that arises from the medical work of the presidential members and others, so it was not a crime of the increase in food on the destiny of the need for it The living power is above what he needs, and its shortcomings were turned on it until it is reported to the estate that is unable One of the two strengths in the place of the appearance of the last power, so they found that the weakness of the live power reduces its work, so the power of the soul is reduced.The body, and the matter comes to it until the owner of this situation becomes close to the signs and the crowds from it to the animal, where he becomes unnamed in the life For the sake of the soul in it, and for that, the transgression of this is necessary for this decrease in a way that does not lead to the conversion of life, because that is the one who is lost And its preparation for the other piety, for this equivalent and survival between the two forces is the origin of the fate of fasting in the bore The partnership is different from the shameful, due to the special conditions, in which the intention is not removed from the two lifes, and there is no doubt that the best of this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The way that Islam came, it was said in the light of the light: the heavy gem of the rock of the kingdom, but it was occupied by its world of the civil powers, and the concern of it.With the spiritual virtue, and the weakening of the cultivation of the civil powers by transporting the food and the multiplication of the slope, sometimes it disrupts the world of sanctity and connects to its father The sanctuary and receives the knowledge from it, so from the fast, the burial is left, eating the domain of the animal and the restrictions on the plant (P-1660) or the milk, and it was the ruling of the righteous Food by graduation until they are used to leave it in a ritual days, and they are stalled on the fact that the graduation of the food of food is not afraid of it, and it is not afraid of the sake of the validity From food with sticks from the tree of figs, a moisture, then it does not renew it, and it weighs every day of its food, and it is not more than its age, and so, it is still up to the time After it, then it is the adultery of the food every day.And in the ruling on the honesty of Sahardi: God “AH.And if he was excused for the human beings, with what is dominated by a vital life that he would be repeated from his animal, so whoever excuses him is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who excludes the Him, with its demands, was a need to require the reassurance of itself to be trained in it in the possibility of the possibility of the distress of it and the time of its time In it, in the amount of place, therefore the fast was one of the most important of this presentation; Because there are two great ones in it; They are the constituent in the supply of living powers and the patience is used to their references, and if the idiots were to the limit that comes from that is excused as you know, the rulers of the rulers are.The articulation of the abuse of it, for those who have the abandonment of the deficiency of the kmalties, and this is the fast of the rulers, and among them is those who tried it from the side of the deficiency of the rituals of the rituals, and this is the domain of which is the rituals of this The intention and the appearance of the kingdom of patience, and that he will bring a human being on the leaving of his lusts, and he will be qualified to create the same It is the weakness of the lowering to the victory of its desires and lusts.؎ If a woman does not leave a food that he loves ∗∗∗, and it is not forbidden for a heavy heart, whereas you are not when you will have a curse for him.The legal intention of the fast was the same as the killing of lusts and the excitement of the feeling of what the people of the competence meet from the pain of hunger, and the sensitivity of the equality of the family And the people of fragmentation in the origins of the pleasures between the two parties of food, drink and fun, so why did the divine toxins disappear in the way of fasting, and what is the time in the way How is it a single image, and it did not take this to the Muslim who takes for the same view of what he deems to be divorced in obtaining the intended definitions.(P-161) I said: The good learning is to be tired of the learner He is informed of it to the one who is drawn from the knowledge that he will pass, because the teacher of the religious whiteness is bonding to the learner of the suffering of the people of the He rose up, raised, kneeling, and in a tear, some of that strengthens the power of his muscles, and some of them are the accommodation of the blood of the blood.How are the people of that known and condemned the acquisition of the crushed fruit, and if all of that of the students would have gone in the ways of the people and the rituals of the rituals and the stature of the pilgrims in The Kayfat is the number of understanding of the students and their choices, and this enters under his words to the Almighty: God wants you to the secret and does not want you.[185] What is meant by the days of his saying: days of numbers [Al -Baqarah: 184] The month of Ramadan at the Jamour of the Physicians, but rather expressing Ramadan, and it is a few days, and it is a few days, and it is a few days It is also a few; He loved his command on the costs, and the hostility is a lion from the few; Because the little thing is considered an adult; Therefore, they say: The many are not considered, and for this time, it is chosen in the description of the collection.The broken one in which there is a lot of harms, Abu Hayyan said when he said the following after him from the last days [Al -Baqarah: 185]: The treatment of the feminine one, the one who says it is the same: except for the numbers of days [Al -Baqarah: 80] and a time that is treated by the female collection of femininity, Nahwah: Makes: A group of numbers, and you do not say a number day, and both of the recipients are eloquent, and it appears that it is left in it in order Remembering if they are female to be feminine, unique; Because the group has been first in the group, and the group is a word, and this is the majority, so if they want to be alerted to the many of that gathering, they will be paid to it.Feminine; Let it be in the sense of the groups, and that the collection will turn into many groups, and for that, I see that the number of more than the number is more than the number Modernity [Al -Baqarah: 80] because they reduce it as fragrances or alienation, and he said here: preparations; Because it is thirty one day, and he said in the following verse: The pilgrimage is a well -known months [Al -Baqarah: 197], and this is the same as his saying in the gathering of camels on one of the two things, and it is from one of those The balance is that the collection is not reasonable, the many come from it with the formula of the female one who says: The trunks are broken and the little of it comes with the form of the form AH was broken.It is not an apparent.It was said: What is meant by the days is not Ramadan, but it is days.When it was imposed (P-162) fasting with his saying: numbers of numbers [Al-Baqarah: 184] Then we copied their fast with the fast of Ramadan, and it is the day The third is ten and the fifteenth, and the fifteenth, and it is a grave, the giving, the giving, and it was not proven from the fasting fasting of the Muslims of the Muslims.Ashura, as in Al -Saheeh, and it is an outfit with the Sunnah, but it was mentioned that the fast of Ashura and the white days were an abuse of the prophet ﷺ and did not prove the narrators, so it is not valid, so it is not valid, so it is not valid, so it is not valid, so it is not valid.From the verse, there is no memory or impact, that all of it has copied all of it with Ramadan, as it was indicated by the hadith of the questioner, who said: I do not increase this, and this is not more ﷺ: “I will be honest.”
