The researcher woke up in the path of God and do not cast your hands to the consort and improve that God loves the good.Etc., then when they were commanded to fight their enemy, and the enemy was a number of them with several war, or they woke them up to the settlement of the money in the way of God All Muslims are not the ones who are fighters.And the pilgrim directed this matter with the fact that the seizure of the war is rushed in the class - the Muslims alerted it, so they may shorten in the coming to the one strong; Because they have filled their hearts in faith in God and trust in Him, and they were full of hearing by the promise of God, whom they are victory and the last one with his saying: and know that God is the one.We alert to the pledge of God for them to be supported and the victory does not fall from them taking the known number, so they do not count that they are not the command of the people The victory that is the causes of God Almighty with its causes on the basis of the rule that the regime that God enacted in the causes and its causes is required, so the causes of the causes are required Literature with the uncle of the reasons and its causes so that they would not be like those who said to Moses, so go to you and your Lord, so that we are here.They are exhausted in something and then they cried in something after that, so God will support them, and support them while they are not accepted by his crime, and they will be blessed with them.As they are the day of the Muslims, when they were not shortened in anything, as they are the nations They are prepared for something and then ask after that of God, victory and wrapping, for those who are people who are deceived, and for that, God bless them.Perhaps they are running through this by his kindness, while he returns to the paths of religion, and the spending is presented in his saying of the Almighty: and from what we have gave them (3) (3) (3) God is his way, and the way is added to something, then it is added to what is connected to it, and when it is known that God does not pray to people, he will be aware of the one who is intended to be from the one who is intended God and His rewards, it is a metaphor in the memorizer and a metaphor in the chain of transmission, and the path of God has dominated the divorce of the law in jihad, that is: the fighting of the defamation of his religion and the righteousness of his religion, The perfection is because the agreement is to give the equipment, the horses, and the increasing, and all of that is a favor of the stress on the face of the metaphor and not to be in.And the Almighty said: And do not cast your hands to the abuse of the sympathy for a sake, the matter is punished by spending in the path of God in the forbidden from the forbidden The works that have harmful consequences to inform the advice and the guidance, so that they do not pay them, and they will protect them with the support of God for them to the seizure of the question of the cautious The meeting with the souls to the consort is the meaning of the matter by spending and other than the vision of the war and the memorization of the souls, and that is in it, the meaning of which is the meaning It is detailed by being able to be an other extent of the purposes of guidance.And the meeting is the throwing of the thing from the hand, and it exceeds one of the same effects, and to the domination of it to it and to the dignity in it.And the prestige is that the hands are the verb when it was not mentioned, and that the B is increased to confirm the communication of the verb with the verb, as they said to the one who is given) Because the one in the war and the like draws his hand, the increase in the B as its increase in the shake of the palm tree [Maryam: 25] and the saying of the good: The earth is one and the meaning: and do not give the destruction of your hands, so it takes you to take the document, and make the consort is like the taking and the captured, and it is not possible for the gathering of the gathering, With this, it is permissible for the self due to the relationship of the member; Because the hand is the most important thing in the soul in this sense, and this is in the two things as a saying of the same: ؎ If it is given a hand in a disbeliever, that is: you met the sun, and it is the same: The hands are used in the sense of self as a (P-214) by the choice, and the active is deleted; That is, do not throw yourself into the consumption of your choice.And the consort - by the compassion of the mother - is the name of a source in the sense of destruction, but rather the name of a source; Because he did not guide in the sources and weighs the acts - in the eyes of the eye - but rather in the struggling sources - by breaking the eye - but it is the source of the weighted.He covered, or the impermissible, as well as a reward, and he told his Sibuh: He has two counterparts in the derivatives: the harm and the escape, with the eyes of the eye, and from the eye, and from the eye, and from the eye, The rigid names: the struggle and the hypocrisy - the first is the name of a tree, and the second is the birth of the tricks - and in the crown of the brochure: that the caliph read it: (Al -Malkalah) like that; If this is not narrated from one of the readers in the famous or the abnormal, then this transmission is correct, so perhaps the successor may be done on the face of the example, so he did not Disputment, for the cell is better than reading the Qur’an with a noticeable letter.The meaning of the forbidden from meeting with the children to the consort: the forbidding from the reason in the contradiction of the soul or the people on the verge of destruction, with the time of the one who will be brought up.He was overwhelmed by spending for the signal of the project of spending and the reason for it With a period of time - a meeting with the children of the people as it was said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Unhereated verse; Because he is like the one who throws himself to the halls and says that God will come to me, so this is forbidden.And in Al -Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas and a group of followers in a meaning and do not cast your hands to the consumption, do not leave the agreement in the path of God, and you will be afraid of God.A deficiency of it.It was said in interpretation and do not throw your hands to the consumption of statements; The first: that (agreed) is a matter of agreed on the children, and (the consort) is the leaving in it or the stingy of the severe, narrated by Bukhari, on the authority of Hudhafah, and it is a distress.God, and that the release of consumption is far away, and on the elderly.(P-215) The second: It is the one on the poor; That is, the charity, and (the frustration) of the constipation, and its promise to the occasion of the elevation and the release of the consumption on the constipation.The third: spending in jihad and meeting to destruction: Al -Kharj, without increasing.The lord: the meeting with the child to the consort: the Islam in the war; That is, do not surrender to the family.Fifth: It is the preoccupation of jihad and spending in it with their money.Al -Tirmidhi narrated, on the authority of the Islam of Abu Amran, who said: We were in the cities of the Romans of the Qustantine, and they were brought out to us with a great class from the Romans, and he came out to them.Like them, a man from the Muslims carried a class for the day until he entered them, and the people shouted and said: Glory be to God, he will be thrown into his hand.The supporters said: O people, you are interpreted by this verse.For some secret without the Messenger of God: Our mothers have been lost, and God has the dearest of Islam and many supporters, so if we stayed in our money, then he will not be lost, so he will not be lost His Prophet returns to us what we said: and spend in the path of God and do not cast your hands to the consort, so the recklessness was the residence on the money and its prayers, and the blessing of the All the acceptable suffering.And the fact of the verb “threw” in the end of the prohibition, the general necessity of every purpose of the child to consent; That is, every cause of perdition is caused by a pillar, so it will be forbidden from it forbidden, there is no obligation to remove that prohibition, which is what is kept on the authority With the achievement of his memorization by meeting the same to the destruction or the memorization of some of it because of that.Excavation in the seizure of stress is forbidden, not a referral; Because it is a construct of child to consumption, And the meeting of the nation and religion to it by contradicting the souls of the Muslims, and the scholars have disagreed with the same as this news that Al -Tarmahi narrated, on the authority of Abu Ayoub The enemy, Al -Qasim bin Muhammad said from the two followers and Abd al -Malik ibn al -Majshun and Ibn Khwayz, who is from the money of the Money That is if there is a power in it, and it is a pure structure for God Almighty and a fatwa in a survivor or in the enemy of the enemy or the intention of the conquest The Muslims one day in the opinion of the Prophet ﷺ, if it was not like that, it was from meeting to ownership.(P-216) And the Almighty said: (And good) Charity, the doctrine of the boring benefits, then if he does, then a painful, well-known, do not be improved, then do not say if you say if you say: I felt to Him, nor if I was running it in harmful delights: I did well for it, and if if he did a harmful, harmful act that is not called good.And in the case of the attachment, “Do you think,“ Warning it on the fact that charity is required in every case, and its words are supported by his saying ﷺ in the authentic hadith: “God is good.” In the matter, after mentioning the matter of the matter, asking for the aggressor and spending in the path of God and forbidding the fear of the child to the consent - the indication of all the conditions of the authority And it is displayed in it, in the interests, the charity is with the conquest of the limits and the caller in the interest and the conviction of what the goodness is in the way, and in the righteousness, and in the righteousness, and in the righteousness, By the companions of the captive and the crime and the memorization of the money of those who are bounds and their exercises from the perpetrators and the burning, and the Arabs say: you are a king who is more likely.Caution from meeting with the bond to consumption is charity.And his saying: God loves the improvement of a sacrifice for the desire for charity; Because the love of God, His servant, is the end of what people demanded, as the love of God, the servant, is the reason for the righteousness and the other worldly From the believers.
