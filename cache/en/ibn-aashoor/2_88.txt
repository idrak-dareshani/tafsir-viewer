The Quranic researcher (P-599) said, “Our hearts are wrapped, but God cursed them with their disbelief.The second face is an interpretation of the arrogance, that is, it will be the ability of his kindness to lied from the sentence of detailing that the arrogance is that I am notice Licborn, murder and symptom.And on the two districts, in the fools of the rhetoric to the absence and a dimension of them from the status of the presence, it is one of the fools whose discontinuity is that what was done on the one who was done on He was obliged to keep him away from the mind and symptoms of the mind of it, so he referred to this dimension by his speech by the speech of the distance, so it is a seduction.The fools have improved that it is authorized by the resignation of the words to the misfortune of their compatibility of the Muhammad al -Muhammad, and it is a new imposition, so they are what it is about what it happens to them.Their prophets directed the speech to them.And when I want the hadith about them in their symptoms from the Prophet ﷺ the speech became a neighbor with the believers and was running on the guarantee of the guarantee of the unseen.On the authority of their saying that our hearts are not wrap Moses came to you with evidence, then you took the calf [Al -Baqarah: 92].The hearts are used in the sense of insulting on the way of the words of the Arabs in release the heart on the mind.And the cost is a guarantee, so the collection of the whole is the same, which is the unknown, the cover is derived from its cost if it makes it a cover for it, and it is the preserved pen of the thing and the rituals of it.This is the words they used to say to the Prophet ﷺ when they prayed to Islam, they intended the recklessness and cut off his greed in their Islam, and he is like the saying You invite us to us and in our ears, a cows, and between us and between you a veil [Chapter: 5] and in the words you find it because the origin of the most is to be the veil of what is not perfect for it.They imagine that their hearts are hidden from understanding and they want to be futile from the understanding of delusions; Therefore, the interpreters said that he is authorized in the sense that it is (P-600) do not know what you say, even if it would be his goods, and these are the two meanings that are included in them.With his saying, “God bless them with their disbelief, that is, there is no one in their faith in their understanding in their understanding, nor for its Lord for the acceptance of the same as the one who is called, for the same God cursed them with their disbelief, and their distance from the good and its causes.With this, the meanings that are intended for them have obtained a need for the imposition of the imposition of a cover for a cover for them to be a cover in the way that it is in the vicinity For knowledge and truth, then the falsehood is not leaked.And God said it, may God grant them their disbelief By that they were silent on the disbelief and the consequences of their debt from other things for the pilgrimage of the Prophet ﷺ So when they were silent against them, God is punished by God So they were forbidden to fulfill them and see the charity of the Messenger, for the curse has obtained a punishment for the silence on the infidelity and the symptoms of the right to the truth And from their hearts created away from the understanding that God created them as the minds of the minds, who are sought by the realization The people of the right to believe from the believers are the only one.And he said a few who believe in separation on (cursing them) and (a few) as a row for a deleted deletion that the verb and the ability to do so is a few faith in the faith and what is a few faith The conversion and the guarantee of the group of the children of Israel and it is permissible to be (a little) as a description of the time that the actual obliges it, that is, a few.And a few may be the rest of it, indicating it to their faith in some book or to their faith in some of what the prophet calls for him Like Al -Tawwahid and the prophecy of Moses, or to the faith of individuals from them in some days, because the faith of a little individuals from them is necessary Low faith.It is permissible to be (a little) here is used in the sense of numbers, for the few are used in the numbers in the words of the Arabs.Many of the passion, various nuclei and the behavior, wanted that he did not complain.Relatives; He wanted to the extent of the relatives and say that so is the little neighborhood, and all of it is either a metaphor because the few are likened to the numbers, or a manner, and it is more prominent because the one is to say to the (P-601) The numbness was necessary for the few claims, so they would be a source of export, and the vagina referred to them in the scouts with a brief His interpretation of his saying is the Almighty God with God a little, you remember [ants: 62] in Surah Al -Nimmal, and he said: The meaning is denied the memory.The few use in the sense of negation, as if the face of that is that the remembrance of it is the knowledge of the knowledge, and if it is reminded of the shareholders, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who remembers By that God is one who does not have an affection for him and their speech by saying God with God [ants: 60] The intended from him denial is based on the fact that they are unable to do so.
