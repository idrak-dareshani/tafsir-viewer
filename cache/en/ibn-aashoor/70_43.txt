The Quranic researcher, and they are going through and playing until they meet their day, who are promising to come out of the events, as if they were a stab.That day, who were promising to be separated from what his saying included, for those who have disbelieved before you, who are groaning [Al -Maarij: 36] from their wills And their saying: We enter Paradise, the mockery of the Qur’an and the Prophet ﷺ.After his heights, in detail and separation, he was removed from that matter of God, His Messenger by blessing them to know that they did not find the guidance and the guidance and the one who is the one who is the guidance And the nuclear.And the meaning of the matter by relying in his saying, and their offspring is that it is a matter of leaving what is most important to the Prophet ﷺ from their stubbornness and their relics on the infidels with the clarity of the arguments, and the rituals are not Their symptoms and their relics on their disbelief are their muddles and their players, as it is about the symptoms by saying that they are going through and playing.A sentence, they go to a sentence, and they play two states of the apparent destruction in its saying, and their atom.This is the case for the matter of the matter in its saying, and their offspring.And appreciation: the offspring of their muds and their players, and they do not grieve their stubbornness and their renovations.And the transgression of the verb (virus) to a guarantee that they are from the jurisprudence of the verb to the self.What is meant is directed to some of the conditions that have been made with that act, like the saying of the Almighty, the dead person is forbidden for you, and the dead is: 3] And that you gather between the two sisters [Women: 23], meaning: to gather them with the grace of a marriage, and the accusation in this is on the horns of the context, as in the verse, and the two of the two, as well So their offspring until they meet their day in which they are stunned [Al -Tor: 45] in the wall of the phase, or on the remembrance of what indicates a special condition like that, and they say that they are in a special condition.The verse, the estimated is different, as it is in the words of the Almighty (P-182), but the wine, the facilitator, the monuments, and the pipes are the abomination of the work of the Satan: So avoid drinking wine, and to reverse the facilitator, and to worship the wounds, and the arrests of the gossip.And this recovery is the one in the origins of jurisprudence with the addition of analysis and prohibition to the two, or the chain of prohibition and analysis to the two, and for the clarity of the significance It is prepared by the philosophers of the origins of the origins before the camel, a dispute of relaxation and some of the Shafi’i.It may be closed from the matter by leaving the kinetah from the compassion and the lack of heritage, as the saying of the siblings of Amr ibn Ma’ad, who will be brought to my brother With the revenge of his brother, the servant of God, and he was killed: “He deposited for you a lifetime that is a lifetime, and this is the stomach of Omar, so it is not a vocalist for the authority of this You are upset with them, and they are without your saying in their affairs, such as his saying Do not go to your souls, with a loss [Fatir: 8].With this, he knows that his saying is the Almighty, and their atoms have no relationship with the ruling of the fighting, nor is it from the elements, nor is it forgotten by the verses of the sword, as it is the one who delusions.And the row: the many words, and what is meant is their mosques in the Qur’an and the prophet ﷺ and the Muslims.And play: humor and mockery, and it is their players in the receipt of the Islamic supplication and their destruction from the limits of reason and the grandfather in the matter of the criminalization of their righteousness.And the reward of going to and playing in the answer to the matter of the exaggeration in the correlation of their staff and their players with a little legacy with them, as it is necessary for them to be rewarded.They are going through and playing, that is: they pass on their mosques and their players, and that does not harm you, and the same is the severity They hope for the days of God to reward a people with what they were gaining [Al -Jathiya: 14], and they said to my servants who say that it is good [Al -Israa: 53].And some of the interpreters and the gravity make its proverbs permissible in the words of the matter, which is estimated that that is the saying of the saying and it benefits the joke of the vagina.(P-183) and (even) is attached to their atom because it has the meaning of their nation and waiting for them, for the day that they promised is the day of the enemy when they are rewarded And their disbelief, it is not an absence of being going through and playing, and the end here is as a way to leave them.And the addition (day) to a guarantee is the lowest of the misery.And the audience read a thousand after the pain.And Abu Jaafar read it with a thousand thousand meeting.And meeting: a metaphor for all estimated: to read the fans is a metaphor of two directions; Because the day does not receive or receive.And on the readers of Abu Jaafar is a metaphor on one side; Because the meeting is between the self.And on the day they come out of the events with a substitute from (their day), it is not a difference.And al -Kharjat: their bodies are from the ground.And read the phrase (they come out) by opening the construction of the effect of the reaction.And Abu Bakr read it on the authority of Asim, by its conquest of the construction of the verb.And the events: the collection of a juvenile, with two conquests, which is the grave, and the grave: a fossil that makes the dead.And Zaid (they come out) is a source of the informants who are informed of the precedent.And all of them were buried in graves or placed in a heart.And the consistency with a conquest of being: the idol, and it is said: a staple with two signs, and the face of its name is a fixedness that it is erected for the worship, and the righteous said: He lives ∗∗∗ and does not worship the Satan Honorable to speed them up in the world to idols for their visits; Because this speed is made with them, and in this similarity a integration of their condition in their condition in The worship of idols and gesture until the day of the day of resurrection is to speed up bid and payment, a penalty on their speeding up to the idols.(P-184) And the fans (a pictured) read the opening of the noun and the hunter.And Ibn Amir and a thunder of Asim read it to include the noun and the one.And the reverence of the vision is to be a luxury to look at the lower of humiliation, as he said (they look at a hidden tariff [Al -Shura: 45]) and he said that their eyes are brought out as if they come from Publisher [Moon: 7].And the origin of the righteousness: the appearance of obedience or the fear of the human being.And the harsh: cheating, that is: covering with streaks, and it is a sense of here; Because the humiliation is not fading.And the sentence of that day, which were promising, so that the surah included in the first purposes of its saying (with a torment and a fall [Al -Mahar: 1) to the saying [Al -Ma’arj: 4] The verses, which are useful with that, confirming the sentence of the sentence until they meet their day who are promised.And in it, it is improved.* * * (P-185) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of Noah, in this name, this surah was called in the Qur’an and the books of the interpretation, and the exaggeration of it, and the exaggeration of it.Sahih with a translation (Surah, we sent Noah [Noah: 1]).Perhaps that was the goodness in the words of the predecessor, and the symbolism was not attracted to it.It is an angel with agreement.The third and the seventy are in the formation of the lighter, and it came down after the number of four of the bees surah and before the surah of the phase.The people promised the city and Mecca, which is three times, and the people of Basra and the Levant promised it nine and ten times, and the people of the kufa are eight and twelve.* * * Its purposes are the greatest of the sailors of the surah, the proverb of the two participants in the people of Noah, and they are the first of the two participants (P-186) who are overwhelmed by the punishment I mean the flood.In this, there is a representative of the state of the Prophet ﷺ with his people in their condition.And in it a many detailing of the call of Noah - peace be upon him - to the unicorn of God and the rejection of the worship of idols and his warning of his people with a torment of his God with the sake Hope and remind them of the day of the Baath.His people are silent against his disobedience and their crucifixion in their evil.The name of the idols that they worshiped.And the call of Noah on his people with recession.She referred to the flood.And the supplication of Noah with forgiveness for him and the believers, and to be aware of all disbelievers.That permeated the integration and the promise of the obedience to the capacity of livelihoods, the multiplication of hypocrisy and the tears of paradise.
