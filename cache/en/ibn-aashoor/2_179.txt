The researcher, your philosophers, in the vicinity of life, O first people, perhaps you will fear the elimination of his signs, the great rulings, aspiring with it the souls of the two parties, the guardians of the blood, the rules of the blood.That is in life in life, and denial in (life) to exalt the reverence of the shrine; That is: in the retribution of life for you; That is, for your souls; In which there are people in the way of killing the souls, and if it is the most important (P-145) the rule of the penalty, the people were not deterred; Because the most intense of the souls of the humanity is the dead, and if the killer knows that he was greeted by the death, he would not be able to kill the murder.Saad ibn Nasheb, when he hit blood and wrapped, and the Emir of Basra punished him with the demolition of his house with it: And make its demolition ∗∗∗ to show me from the rest of the feet as a need, and it is small in the eyes of my birth if I feminin In the ignorance of the ignorance, they were exhausted in the killing and the affairs of the matter as it was presented, so it was in the Sharahiyyah al -Qasaba a great life from the two sides, and for the sake of the two sides, and for the sake of the ritual And pardon is a contradiction to the rule of reins; Because the hardware is obtained by the evacuation of the guardian in the acceptance of the religion, the guarantee of the killing does not reassure the pardon of the guardian, except for a ram.And in his words, the Most High: O first people, alert him to the rudder of calling on reflection on the rule of retribution, and that is to come in the definition of the way of the addition of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same.Because the rule of retribution is not perceived by the people of the correct view; As it is in the opinion of the opinion, as if it is a wise man with the same as the crocodile; Because there are a second purpose, but it is a long life that is not sober for the two who are present.And he said: (Perhaps you will fear), as an affection for perhaps; That is, a close to you to fear, so do not get married in taking revenge for justice and fairness.And “perhaps” for the hope, and it is a representative or a liking, as it is presented at the saying of the Almighty: O people, worship your Lord to God: You fear [Al -Baqarah: 21]) at the first surah.And his saying: He has a life of the words of the word, which was more than a walking man who is the example of the Arab And those who came after him came from the scholars of the suffering, and we have increased them: that the penalty has been preserved.They blew with the fight, and this is not beneficial to them.
