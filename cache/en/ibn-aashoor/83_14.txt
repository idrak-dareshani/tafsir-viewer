The Quranic researcher, but rather on their hearts, did not gain all [Al -Mutaffifin: 15].Performance of deterrence and bayan for him; Because all of their saying of their sayings are the legends of the first, that is, their saying (P-199) is invalid.And he added, but for the abuse, confirmation of all guarantees, and a revelation, when they made them to say in the Qur’an what they said, and that they did not blind their feet from the two.And the two: the righteousness who raises the unicorn of the sword and the mirror, and it is said in the source of the Rayyan, the same as the defect and the games, the dhimma and the condemnation.And the origin of his action is to support the thing that was afflicted by the two, and it is said: Ran the sword and the garment of the garment, if it was struck by the two, that is: it became a ray, and what is in it, and what is in it.On the coverage, so he did a verb in the sense of my deceit, so they said: The sleepiness was on so -and -so, and the wine was ran, and so he said: On the sword, and from the narratives of the Qur’an this action became people saying: Rin on the heart of so -and -so and so who passed through his heart.The meaning: their hearts covered their business to enter them, understanding the Qur’an, and the wide colors between it and between the first myths.And the jams read the slurring of the pain in the Arabs after its heart is behind to approach its exit.Asim read it by standing on the mother of Lam, but rather the word of Ran, to avoid slurring.And he read it with a light trauma on a lam, but to show that it is a mother.He said in the tongue: The purification of the mother is a language for the people of Hijaz.Sibuyeh said: They are good, and Al -Zajaj said: The slurring is more likely.The hearts of the minds and the referral of perception, and this is the same as the Almighty: God has seen their hearts [Al -Baqarah: 7] in Surah Al -Qar.And from the words of the sponsors of the Arabs, they address their camels in the intensity of the cold.Youth salt with life, as in its appearances, he asked for his uniqueness, and that he is in need, there is generous.They did not gain what they had done in the way of their bodies of their work and their oath from (P-200) reflection in the verses until the symptoms and stubbornness became a creature in origin in them, so they do not understand them.The indication of evidence is on its significance.Al -Tarmahi narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah on the authority of the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: “The servant, if he sinned a sin, then she is a sinner, and if he is a disorder, then he is a disorder, so if he is a ritual His heart was broken, so if he returned in it until he raised his heart, and it is the ransom that God mentioned in his book, but they were on their hearts.Al -Tirmidhi said: This is a good hadith.And the coming of the form of the harmony without the past to benefit from that is the gain and its number in the past.And in the remembrance of the act, they were without saying: what they gain, indicating that what is meant: what they have caught in their customs from the trace before the coming of Islam, so they are They did not have a mandate for days.They are contrary to what the worse, the frequency and the frequency of the nations came to the nations to the ritual of God, with the distraction Take the people of the family with the sins of the trace of God, according to what was required by the evidence from the book and the Sunnah, or those who are violated to require the significance of the mind of the clear mind The disgraceful and the right to the time of the time of Islam until this surah has come down, it is a period that is not short.And the second is a certainty for the first, an increase in the deterioration, to make a sting.
