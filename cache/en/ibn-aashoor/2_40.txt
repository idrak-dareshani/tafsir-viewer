The Quranic researcher (P-447), my children, remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and fulfilled my covenant, thousands of your covenant, and my people, so they will be taken from The preaching of the disbelievers from the people of the book, and that is the preaching of the advanced teams of its remembrance, because the companions of the hypocrites do not return to those who are the ones who are no longer.The people of the book are the Jews, and the rhetoric is directed here to the children of Israel, and they are the most famous nations of the world with the wide and broad laws, and that is because this is the Qur’an for me It was his surah, which is his gossip, as a result of the abundance that came for his sake, and the one came to this exhibition on the first of the methods and the righteousness I opened it in the intensity of this book and the effects of its guidance and what they are followed by the slander of the world and the other And his way is confused, and described in this way of the conditions of people, you will receive this book of believer, infidel, and hypocritical, after that, accept the kinds of you The intended, and the three items have been confined to this book with the proportions of their condition, towards the Islamic supplication in two sinks.That is, my writers, as the two hypocrites were exhausted in the solid classification because they are from the Jews as we came.So the partners invited his worshipers to say to him, O people, worship your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 21].Dahir.And if all the people are intended for, then worship your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 21] He will be summarized by them, not a referral, as the believers are not in the hands of those who are in that The creation of their origins and the origins of the blessings of life, which is the creation of the earth and the sky, and the removal of water from the sky to the exile And death, and remind them of a great blessing, which is the grace of their origin and his repentance to their children, all of that is a limit over the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of They have religious origins that can make a reference in the conjugate and the argument that they are convinced of it, and addressed them in the matter of proving the sincerity of the Messenger The one who realizes their rhetoric’s tastes, so he said, and if you were in a rapper, what we have revealed to our servants, and they came with a wall of his like [Al -Baqarah: 23].And when all of it spent his right, he accepted the speech here on the second class, and they are the people of the bodies and the book.Mashhaour in the whole world, and they are the most desirable of this description of those who speak to the two dominant Arabic language and what is About it, and they are also those who have appeared to be stubborn and spoken to this religion, and for the sake of that, he did not invite the Jews to neither Remember the blessings of God on them and to what they were met by their prophets from their lies, so that they remember that this is the Sunnah of God and to return to them.They derive from those who lied to their prophets and reminded them of their messengers and their prophets with a prophet who comes after them.And the rhetoric of the speech to them is another way, which is that he ran them with the scientific evidence of the religious and the true religious evidence and the truth of the righteousness Establishing honesty with the miracle of the Qur’an, as they were not from the chances of this field as we presented it in the interpretation of his saying, “God does not come to me.” 26] Their speech was here with religious evidence and the arguments of the Moussan Projects, so that the evidence of the Messenger of the Messenger would be in the absence of his condition, and that he came to him and that he came to him and that he came to him and that he came to him The messengers.The Qur’an has been exhausted in that and in which it is in it from the grave to its sister with a buddling dress in the argument of the addressees, and he benefited in it, knowing the Muslims, not even those who are not.The Israeli said, "I did not have a verse that the scholars of the children of Israel teach him [poets: 197] So the science was then the knowledge of the legislation and the knowledge of the year And the conditions of the two worlds, the two worlds, with the moral commandments and the moral sermons, so that the Jews were the Arabs, and for the sake of the Arabs, the Arabs were in the Arabs.Jews are distinguished by the Arabs in their country with civil thought.The general knowledge of Jews in this matter was weak, but it was unique with its knowledge of their scholars and their ink, so the Qur’an came in his guests, knowing the teacher, as well They have the scholars of the children of Israel, until the high degree is for them because they are guaranteed this science to their linguistic science The Muslims are equal in the knowledge of the family of the Israelis, and this is a great meaning of the suffering of the teaching and attachment to the abuse of the two.And with it, it will reveal to you a wisdom that the Qur’an is exposed to the hearts of the nations and their liability, for that with the lesson, you will have a bumper.We have prepared this one of the miracles of the Qur’an, which is that he explained the conditions of the children (P-449) The fear of the crowd in the prejudice and the benefits, so the Qur’an came to the tongue of the people of people from them and from their knowledge, he is unacceptable with what he does not know.The miracle of the two writers is based on the rhetorical miracle of the illiterate.The Imam has presented this in the seven.I was terrified in this resignation, the pursuit of the books of Al -Tawara, as she commented as the book of forming with the book of Al -Kharj, that is, the description of the conditions of the children Moses mission and may be confined to what is in the travel of the formation of the creation of Adam and the land of the earth because it is the subject of the lesson and it is transmitted from that to me.Throwing to them and the nation.He said it, O sons of the rhetoric of the atoms of Jacob, and in his offspring, the path of the nation is confined to the Judaism, and he addressed them with this description, For his being is the name of the tribe.For the children of Israel, if he believed in the children of Israel, the Prophet ﷺ would not have followed their followers because the imitation is followed by his imitation.Because this speech is to remind the blessings of God that God blessed them on their predecessors and dignities that they honored with them, so it was to call them with the title It is appropriate for that not to see that when they were mentioned by the title of religion in the debt of Moses, they mentioned the descriptions of those who have guided in the saying of the Almighty that those who believe in: The verse is as it will come close.And the speech is brought to him to all the children of Israel, whose scholars and their generalism include them, because what they have attached to it is from the memory of the grace of God on their predecessors.Likewise, we find their speech in the purposes from which the registration is intended for all of them, and it is a grace, O people The abuse was recorded on their scholars.In the way of the interesting news, which suits their scholars, a special one, such as his saying, and it was a group of them who heard the words of God, then they will warn him of what they say: 75]..Sufficient and do not buy my verses a little.In their hands [Al -Baqarah: 79] The verse, and when a book came from them with God, it is true to what was with them and they were before they were shouting on those who disbelieved, so they came to them.Those who conceal what we have revealed from the sons and guidance after what people have shown in the writers of those (P-450), curses them with God [Al-Baqarah: 159] Every verse you followed before you [Al -Baqarah: 145] the verse.If the speech comes with an inclusive basis for their scholars and their generals, it is noteworthy to all A sect of the two sects is what is appropriate for it.And the sons of what was attached to the gathering of the male, the peaceful, and that it was not because he entered his breaking by the deletion of his mother and the increase in the pronouncement of the prayer in the first place Abra.He was disagreed at the origin of a son, and he was said to be a derivative of the sons of any, so it is a source in the sense of the verb like creation, so I will be found by me, that is, it is a building, because his father is.His mother to lightness and compensate for it is the thunderbolt of the connection, so it is appropriate in the sense of the detence, but the deletion is then that it is not a measuction, because it is not the right.It is costing to him that the ya moved with a knock on what accepted it, so its movement was transferred to the resident, a procedure for him, the course of the word of the word, then when it was transferred to you The confusion with the deeds of the sons, so the lam was deleted, and the thorns of the connection was given.Its origin was said, and on the weight of a bond or the sons of the cousin of the noun or by the investigations, so the waw was deleted, as it was deleted from his grooves, and this is a brother and a brother and a brother The derivation and a distance from his organs, because its cleaning when it was deleted, the blame of which was not compensated for the thunderbolt of the connection.And the family of the neck of Yaqoub ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, peace be upon them, said Ibn Abbas, which is based on the servant of God, because (Asara) in the sense of the servant of the servant of God) Two words (Asra) and (Il) the name of God Almighty, as they say the house of Il is a name for a village called, and it is more, from the land of the people of his descending from the sake of peace be upon him His brother Esu and built a slaughtered in it and called his name to the house of El.And in the books of Jews that the causes of the name of Jacob Asial that he was disagreed with his migrants from being attached to him, his brother Aiso, to be a loyalty to him He knew that he is his Lord, that is, the king of the angels of God, so he grabbed him and his caravan is the whole of the night to the soil of the dawn, so he said: Yaqoub, I do not divorce you until you bless me, and he said to him: What your name said: Yaqoub said to him that your name does not claim to be Jacob after the day, but you are (p-451) And you estimated, and blessed there.This indicates that (Asra) in this name is returned to the meaning of the families in the war, as it is in the Arabic, then if this is from the origin of the dew, then it is on the authority of the one who is the one He has an honorable or ancient king like that.Then, if they are punished for him, they are the most famous of their children, because they are the tribes of Isaac ibn Ibrahim, and to these tribes, he will return Remembering the tribes in this surah.And remember something from the remembrance, which is the remembrance of the fragmentation and its annexation, it is called the seeds of something in the mind of those who forgot it, and that is said, and how it is to mention it Satisfaction in the name of the thirsty thing In the minds of people, then I will be released on the forefront, because the matter is that no one does not speak in the name of the thing unless it becomes dangerous with it, and it is with it, and it is with it.The brokenness of the humiliation and its opponent, so make the broken for the linguist and the guarantee of my mind and perhaps it is a separate separation, as it is not a decent One of my one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the work of the work, so that it becomes a clips, not to put it until it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the union of the What is forbidden from the pretext of the two issuances of the two issuers, and Omar said - may God be pleased with him - is better than the remembrance of God with the tongue, the remembrance of God, when he is forbidden.And the intended here is the mental remembrance, as it is not intended to mention the grace of the tongue.And what is meant by the blessing here is all what God has blessed with the addressees, or by the mediation of the year on their ancestors, because the grace on the predecessors is for the sake of the people, because the grace is for the sake And a place that they bear with it, and a blessing that they will return from, and the condition of the present was in its causes, and some blessings be upon it, so that God is the fast of God And that may be inherited in the children.And if not for that blessings, their predecessors have their predecessors, or they would not be suddenly, so their children came in evil.So all the blessings that God has blessed with them, and it is in a house, remember my blessings on you.This general is the benefit of adding a grace to the guarantee of God Almighty, as the addition comes to what the lam comes to him and does not straighten the suffering of the covenant mother, as it is not in the words.With a bond, and the meaning of the gender mother is not evaluated, so it is to be the addition of the meaning of the imam of the darkening, so the general is made from the addition of the nursery The origin of jurisprudence is the one who remembers the universal individual in the form of the general, and it was mentioned by Imam al-Razi in the crop in the same (P-452).And he said to me the addition of the debt when the imam was evidenced by the general of the mother, and Ibn al -Sibki said in the explanation of the son of Ibn al -Hajib: The correctness is the same as the Almighty saying, so that those who disagree with his command [Al -Nur: 63], that is, every command, and may support the intent of the general of the bureau of Islam, so that it can be caused by a lot of blessings.And what is good that God has blessed with their predecessors and on those present, from whom the Qur’an is revealed, so the blessing is on their predecessors They were upon them, as they were a village in the country of the Arabs, after being robbed of their country, and he made them in the love of the lives with the mother and the goodness.And the matter is the remembrance of the blessing Here, it is intended for his necessity, and it is its thanks, and from the first attributes of the thanks, leaving the arrogance in receiving what is attributed to God from the message in the view of its evidence and the follow -up of what comes to it.So he said that I have been blessed with a description that I refer to it to the grace of the grace of blessings because of what is given to the person who is the one who has been given to the one who is the one who said: His blessings upon you, so that you may thank you [Al -Ma’idah: 6] and it is beneficial with that of them by thinking of the blessings that they are blessed with, so that they will be blessed with them.Remember the goodness of what he has a bite and a scorpion for him from the envy that is about to be preoccupied with the blessings of others, and this is a matter of their abuse of them.From the book and the ruling with the mission of Muhammad ﷺ and the prophets were transferred from the children of the Arabs to the Arab Other than that, because the sense is the origin of the information, then if the envy sees the blessings of others, it is also in a blessing, then if he wants to tell him about the grace of the good His envy is that their envy is the one who is without their belief in it, so it will be his adultery, and the adultery of his saying is the Almighty, or they envy the people of what they have given.[54] And it is presented to his saying and fulfilled my covenant from the door to evaluating the domination of the domination of the mobilization of the task, and it will be made by the speech It is prepared for their souls to deliver the speech in a long and fair peace.And the saying of the Almighty and fulfilled my covenant is an important act from the deceased and the origin of the meaning, and in the fullness of the matter you say and his time is his right, and when the deceased was the one who did not Al -Mahamouz is an adequate increase for the equality between your saying and his time is his right and his fulfillment of his right to appoint the increase in the absence And I am busy, and as for the weakness, it is more informed because he did, and if he saw you, he will do in his suffering, except that when (P-453) indicated that it was a matter The exaggeration is because the matter that is doing is leaving to be perfect.Evidence may be released on the achievement of the promise and the covenant with great release.The covenant is presented with its saying when the Almighty saying, those who pass the covenant of God after his charter [Al -Baqarah: 27] in this surah.And the covenant here is the obligation for others to treat a commitment in which the institutes are not overlooked until they annul it between them and the covenant is added to the guarantor of the majesty of the majesty of what is in the manner Religion is used as a metaphor for the acceptance and income in the debt, and the added to the guarantee of those who address the promise of that is in the last in the last and the one who is in the last of the world in the last Every era is a solid metaphor The first covenant was used in the talisman, the second covenant was used in the promise of the reward and victory, and the loyalty is used with both of them in the realization The likeness of it to the imams of the likeness is a nomination for his settlement, and for you to make the group a liking representative by the likeness of the one who is the one who said: And that they do not shorten the work and from God, and the promise of God to them with the reward for the bodies of the pledges to the commitment of each of them with a work for the other in the other This is the form of words that are disgraced to his saying and fulfill my covenant, and I will fulfill your covenant.I am with your covenant and approximated by the problems.And on the two of the two, the covenant is in the two times added to the active, which is what the owner of the scouts went to, because his addition to the verb is a good one, if he is stuck to the With the covenant of itself, then if the covenant is added, which is the effect of it, they will not be done to the verb of the fulfillment of the fulfillment, it is that it is that its addition to the verb is the one who is the one A single, as the investigator indicated to him, if it is installed, then create it because the preserved is the same as the similar body, to add to it, not to the sake of it, not to the sake of the Existing.And from the sects of the Qur’an in the choice of the memorial of the era for the settlement here, to give up God, the Almighty, that this is a speech to them for the sake of what is known to them.The descending on Moses, peace be upon him, will be thrown at them with the covenant because it is the rituals of God Almighty for them, and therefore it was expressed in the positions Whoever knows only their scholars, and they are more insignificant than them in everything, where only the people of religion are known to them, so he will come to the tongue of the Prophet, who is the mother of the Prophet.From the knowledge of the unseen.The covenant was taken on their predecessors by the mediation of their messengers and their prophets.A believer for what you have to believe in and support him [Al -Imran: 81] The verse, and when those who address the verse had been given to the verse, they were given the law of the law of the law.The covenant is obligatory for them and the one who was appointed to them was because they were the ones who came to the Messenger.And his saying, and my people, they are gone.The one who is born of it is the origin of the method of the establishment to take into account the external structure in the news and the creation because it is the original that did not exist.To enrich the kindergarten and from it in the Qur’an, his saying, and when our messengers came, a misfortune is bad for them, and they were narrowed with them, and he said this is a day They are pursued to him [Hood: 78] etc., when they open their speech by reminding the richness that is sent on the thanks of the blessing and the monitoring of the right of the right and the right of the right to the right of the right He was shrouded from the confession of the blessing as we came.Then he composed his saying and fulfilled my covenant, which is the principle of what is meant by the matter of believing the Messenger, which is on the authority of the messenger.Then he followed that with his saying and my people, and they are fooling, so it is permissible for that preceding matter to forbid what is between them and between them and the one who is the same They are their greatness and their ink by them from the resignation of what they have to do with the convergence On the day of Moses, we will not affect you from what came to us from the evidence, which was broken, and they were free to address their masters and their lobes with the same Muhammad.So the effect of the verb here is a certainty of the one who is the one who is the one who is a prestige, a denial, and a choice of the palace of the narration of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not It is the matter of the fear of God, and it is forbidden for the monk, other than the concepts.You prevent them from fulfilling the servant, the end of the terrifyingness of God, with the matter of the territory of God Almighty in one form.And the presentation of the verb with the preoccupation of its act by its guarantee, I am affirming the benefit of the urbanization of the adherence Get away from the part of the like, I have taken away, as the owner of the scouts referred to him, as he said, and he said, from your saying, more, and I have been struggled with him, and he confirmed the benefit of the eaten from you.And he directed him to provide the active, the elimination, except that the prayer is in it that (P-455) is indicated by the edition, unless you establish the two centuries on the righteousness of The verb is the work of the submitted of the submitted, the increase of its firmness was the one who was the one who was the consequences of the piety, and that is because the chain of transmission to the verb to the verb is to the one to The advanced phenomenon benefits the piety, so it is determined that the effective evaluation of the choice without piety, as piety has obtained the chain of transmission to the verb or the action first The advanced and second to the guarantee of the advanced, and for this, the owner of the scout did not say: It is the most trivial and the most powerful is the most powerful; Sincerely does not accept piety.Rather, he said, and he confirmed the benefit of the sealing, that is, the testimony of the seed is stronger because the introduction of the evaluation of piety has become With a very weak work.We are claiming that the preoccupation is appointed to discharge, so it may come with no specialization in the part of his saying, “We are the one who has created it with the moon.” One we followed [Al -Qamar: 24] and say Zahir.الالالالالالالية I see them, they became more correct, the money of money is made by the extent of the dazzling that there is no meaning to specialize in the thing that is what we mentioned, so that it is not the case that it is not the case The formula for being for specialization, as the Arabs do not provide the active majority except for that or the missions to what the conquest of the congregation directed, that the act of the verb is in the way It remains in his condition, but if you estimate the deleted act, advanced on the verb, the progress was for piety, and if you appreciated it after the verb, it was the verb, it was the verb.It is in the case of the fate of the verb, with the fact that the act of the verb is not observed by the ablution, and because they set it on the authority of it The poisonous is accustomed to the urgent adherence and the repetition of the attachment.With the intention of speaking, it is not before the Sama` with the knowledge of his intention, and it is not correct that the choice be in the appreciation of the Samaid.This and the adherence, if it is associated with fulfillment, is in it, because the fulfillment, as in this verse, is authorized by an estimated condition, and when this condition is not the same It is generally estimated if it is something or what is something, as the owner of the scouts indicated to him in his saying, and your Lord, and he grew up [Al -Muddathir: 3] The condition is as if it was said when it was not, so it would not be called for his pride.The meaning is here and fulfilled my covenant, and I will fulfill your covenant, and it is nothing, so I have eagerly, so when the condition of the condition was deleted, after the condition, after the condition, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the condition, after the condition.For the waves of compassion, then it was made up to the answer, as the P-456 (P-456) letters, and I said, and I fled, instead of being said to be frightened.And commenting on the general condition is necessary for the achievement of the answer to the answer because the conditional attachment to the house of the cause of the cause is the cause of the cause, so if it is the one who is suspended Achievement of Al -Qaqaa to the same way of the two events, from the fact that the suspension of the comment is achieved, and this is based on the sake of its Sibuh in the matter The name on which the action is based, and that is the same as your saying, increase it, and like that.In order to appeal.Do you not see that if you said, “more, then we will not be upright, then he indicated that the fulfillment here is in the sense of fulfillment of the penalty, then he is the reward of the time, and that it is the time of the time.The preoccupation indicated A general condition is deleted, and that the fulfillment was inside the name, so it was closed to the ruling of the fulfillment of the answer.The Qur’an, and I did not remember that I found like it in the words of the Arabs.And what supports what the owner of the loaded scout is gone to the words of Sibuyeh from the adoption of the fulfillment, poetry, with an estimated condition, that the majority of the arms of the fabric The one who is on its income is to fall after a final or an order that is contradicted and forbidden that entered that fulfillment of that fulfillment of the saying Before you, you are a blessing [Al -Zumar: 65] to his saying, but God is worshiped [Al -Zumar: 66] and the saying of the east is that the Satan is worshiped, and God will be worshiped, so what is the same.From it a condition in the meaning, and the fulfillment is a missionary of that condition and a sign of it, so for the sake of his being, it is an indicative of it with two ways, as if it was like it, and it was like it.If you share your work, your work [Al -Zumar: 65], and if you worship something, God will worship, as well as in the house.This is a plural that the predecessor is not expressed, so take it and not be afraid.(P-457) Al-Tafizni said and it was transferred from the owner of the scout that he said that in his saying, the Exalted, and my people, they wrapped out from the affirmation: the adherence of the opposite and the abundance The connected, and the righteous, is given to it and the consequences of its estimation.And there is no dread.And what is in the sense of the condition in the midst of fulfillment, as if it was said if you are monasticists, and they are gone.He wants to be able to assume the testimony of the one who is confirming, the conqueror, the owner of the conquest, said that there is no confirmation and discretion, not to confirm the affirmation and the confirmation The communication, when he returned the chain of transmission, is the intended of the adulterers, with his saying, he is given to him, and he is given to the linguistic compassion, that is, a punishment and a punishment for him.The grammar is as it does not evaluate here.So you obtained that in expressing such a choice in the words of the ablution, four times: the repetition of the adherence to the act of the one who is the one who is the one) And his assessment of his act is working in his guerrilla, as much as it has taken it.And he ran it on his action with the action of the verb with the fulfillment of the like and your Lord, so grow up.And his presentation on his act in his guarantee with the composition of the verb with the fulfillment of the grace and the days of the people, the second, the third and the sequence of them.The speaker, after the noun, was deleted in his saying, and they are gone to the public from the tenth in the connection and the endowment, and it is proven to be in Jacob.And the Arabs are gambling, they delete them in standing without the connection, and these people are omitted in standing and the connection, and the people of the Hijaz are proven in both cases, On the authority of the connection, such as the stand, because the word fled, it was written in the journalist Imam Bedoun J, and I read like that in the Sunnah of the Qadi.This was directed that it was signed, and they were seen, and they were seen as the righteous on it.It is deleted, deleted in communication and coffins.Because the language of this deletion is divorced, and the readers of Jacob by proving the ya in the connection and standing are running on the language of the people of the Hijaz, and because it is the same as it, and it is the same as the It has been the first of her writers in the journalist that he was accustomed to the reader that the reader will run it on his narration, and for that if you were not in the A separation from the verse, when the public agreed on its deletion, as it is in the saying of the Almighty, I will answer the call of the call if he claims [Al -Baqarah: 186] as it will come.
