pronouncements of the ritual.The meaning: that your Lord is on the meteorology of the lying, and their affairs are not hidden from it, so it will be proven to the prophet ﷺ as his saying: Do not think that God does not.42].The confession is in his saying: Did you not see a report, and the one who addresses the Prophet ﷺ is proven to him and promised to support, and to be brought to the two people, and he will be brought up with the people of the two, So this three nations did a preacher and a warning to the people who did the same as their actions from the denying the messenger of God, the purpose of it His solutions are signed; Because the remembrance of the regulations and the briefing of the ideals is brought to the time of the strange thing; Because after the covenant, he will forget the people, and if the people are forgotten, the people will fall and its fall, then the remembrance removes the repetition.This lesson is parties from the guarantee of the answer to the division, if it is deleted, then its remembrance is its evidence, and if the answer is his saying: If your Lord is the one who is the one who is the one The answer (P-318) is an increase in the way of eagerness to its delivery, and to the sons of the answer, before its remembrance, so that it may get after its remembrance, it will be determined.And the vision is in what you see, it is permissible to be a scientific vision that similar to it for the knowledge of the Levantine with vision in clarity and exposure; Because the news of this nations is wide, harmed by the ideals, as if it is a

of the Arabs, and they talk to the Arabs.And I want the nation’s return, not a referral.And he was tossed by breaking the hamza and opening the name of the name of Iram bin Sam ibn Nuh, which is a back grandfather; Because he is the son of Ashin ibn Iram, and he is a variety of shrouds of dirt; Because the excessive Arabs are considered out of the names of the usual Arabic language, so it is the kindness of Bayan, because it is a return to the indication that the intention is that it is the one who is the one who is the same Ashin ibn Iram, and he is the usual of the first in the first saying: And that your family is the first one [Al -Najm: 50] so that it is not deluded that the one who talks about them is a good way.It was descending Mecca with the bonds, it is said: They are the rest of the first time and the most important of the first tribe.It was described as the same baptism, and with a feminine description; Because what is meant is the same.(P-319) and the baptism: a

power of the house is the same pillar.وإطْلاقُ العِمادِ عَلى القُوَّةِ جاءَ في قَوْلِ عَمْرِو بْنِ كُلْثُومٍ: ؎ونَحْنُ إذا عِمادُ الحَيِّ خَرَّتْ عَلى الأحْفاضِ نَمْنَعُ مَن يَلِينا ويَجُوزُ أنْ يَكُونَ المُرادُ بِـ العِمادِ الأعْلامَ They were in their ways to guide them to the municipality, which is mentioned in his saying, the Almighty: You are born with all the goods that you are tired [Al -Shuara: 128].And it was described as the same baptism for its strength and its intensity, meaning: the family of God has been a people who are more severe than the people who lied to you, he said: “And it is one of the sins.What I have brought out to your family, so we do not support them [Muhammad: 13] and he said: They did not walk in the land, and they would see how the punishment of those who were before them were from them.And the one: honestly on the back of the tribe, as it was described as the same baptism and the Arabs say: the daughter of the daughter is overlooked, with the following.And the country: a whole country, and a country, which is a wide area of ​​the earth appointed by limits or residents.And the curiosity in the country for the tongue and the meaning: which was not created like that nation in the land.And I want the creation of the creation of their bodies, so it was narrated that they were more powerful, and they were the people of mind and mob They were tired of depletion, and they were drunk.And it is clear that the lameness of the definition is here for the customs of the well -being, meaning: in the country of the Arabs and their domes.The stories were placed around his words, the highness: the same baptism is a lying story The pillar is a compound, made a name for a city with a person, or by the shams, or in Egypt, and they described its shortcomings and its censorships with descriptions that are not used, and they say: God ibn Qalbah was in the time of the Khaldeh Mua’awah ibn Abi Sufyan Taht in the abuse of the camel (P-320) for him, so he looked at this city, and that he did not tell him, and that he did not tell him The place that claimed that it was found in the city, and they did not find anything.These are the lies of a mixture of ignorance, as it is correct for its name to be a toss and follow the same pillar with an opening (Irm) and the fracture of (the same).It was to build a reward on the conquest, and if the name is a paradise and (the same) is a row for it, so there is no face to break (the same), on the authority of this name of the name That is all.And the prevented from the scourge; Because what is meant by the known nation, and described the name of the communication to the collection of the remembrance in his saying: Those who answered without saying the one who answered the one who answered The people, when it was described as amended from its ethnicity, softened in the tubes.And the meaning of answered, and that is: the rocks and took it as a homosexual as the Almighty said: and you will be made from the mountains of the homes [poets: 149] and it was said: that the first Roccus and marble.The rock: the great carpenter.And Al -Wadi: A name for a land between two mountains, and it is called a lot of water, and in it two languages: that the last of it is a sign, and that it is a sign, and that it is a sign, and that it is a sign, and that it is a sign of it After the sign.And the generosity read the Bedouin J, and the son of Katheer read it and a miserable in the last of it, and a ritual and standing, and he read it and sprayed on a fold of a loyalty in the connection and the one who is in the end of the A building on the observance of the communities, then what was presented in its saying is up to the Almighty: and the night if it is easy [Al -Fajr: 4] and he is drawn in the journalist with the same as J, and the readings are not.The drawing of the Qur’an, as the intended from the writing of the Qur’an is to remember the memorizers, so that it may forget it.Al -Wadi: He knew about the prevailing of the homes, and it is said to him: The villages are valley, by adding it to the villages whose daughters were built in it, and it is also called the stone, and the wickedness of the The stone is a thoroughness, which is a valley between Khaybar and the development of the way of the city from the city to the Levant, and the Jews came down after a thorns, when they came down to the country of the Arab And its vicinity, excuse and dialect.(P-321) The Prophet’s invaders ﷺ and opened it for seven years, so he became Muslim in it from the Arabs, and the Juda was switched to a reward.And what is in his saying: (with the valley) for the perfection.What is meant by (Pharaoh) is his and his people.And it was described (the one who has the affairs) because his kingdom was under the end of the signs that his ancestors were built; Because the image of the ritual on the ground is similar to the savings, and it is permissible to be (Al -Autaad) For the possibility and steadfastness, that is: with a power, on the one hand of his saying: (the same mayor) and she was presented when he said: (He lied to the people of the people It is the affiliation [p.12]) in p.And his saying: (Those who have overwhelmed the country) may be in a whole for all the masculine: returning, firm, and sponsors, and it is permissible for you to be a good

country, and when their country was from the sentence of the country: Their tyrants in their country have fallen into the country; Because the corruption of some is a matter of the corruption of the whole of the Sunnah of the Sunnah, and for that, he caused him what was removed from him from his saying: (So they will be more He accompanied him on the basis of the rights of people, for it is a destination that will be bad for his words and his mourning, for each one of them is overwhelmed by those who are without him, and that is a great person; Because it is the abstinence of the divine bodies and the righteous laws, and it is on the other side that enriches the memorizers and the unnecessary in the tyranny of it from the one who is the one who is grace For the migrants and their souls, their souls are on the purchases of the provisions of the affairs and the lines of the circles with them, so they will have the same as the most disturbed, and the men of the debt are the men From them is frightening, and they think that they are bad in every case and warn them, so the nation’s power will be distributed to its individuals, and it is a dedication to the enemies of it Performing in the out of the outside, and the performance of the inside, and that leads to a great corruption.It is permissible for the curiosity to be in (the country) to define the covenant, that is: in their country, and the collection of adoption of time, that is: every nation was overwhelmed.(P-322) and corruption: the bad condition of the thing and the harm to it, the Almighty said: (And if he takes over, he will seek in the land to spoil in it and destroy the height and the hypocrisy [Al-Baqarah: 205]) Hope: (And do not spoil the earth after its conversion [Al -A'raf: 56]) And what they had more than corruption was caused in the anger of God, and God does not love corruption.And the casting is its truth: emptying what is in the custody, and it is here to be a bishop of torment, and it surrounded it as the water is poured into the mug, or the railway, and the railway, The suspicion is compounds from the speed and the many, and its counterpart is the emptying of the emptying in its saying: (Our Lord empties us with patience [Al -Baqarah: 250]) And the counterpart of the good: The lane.The torment that affected these was a surprising torment.As for returning, they saw the wind, and they calculated it, and it was a rainy bid.As for the thumbs, they took them.As for Farahn, they calculated the sea, so that He sponsored them, but he surrounded them.Al -Satat: A coastal machine that is taken from an additional galaxy that is harmed by the horses to discipline and to carry it on the increase in the run.And on the authority of Al -Farah that the word (the slave of a torment) is said by the Arabs for every torment in which he enters the whisper (i.E.It falls by the whispers), he wants that it is like that The verse is like that.And the addition of “Sut to“ to “torment” from adding the row to the Sufis, meaning: poured on them with a torment, meaning: like a whisper at the speed of the injury, so it is like it.And the sentence (your Lord is on the meteorology) is a sacrifice and an infection for their injury with a torment of torment if the answer of the division is estimated.It is permissible for the answer to be the department as it is presented.So, as the sentence of the sentence is a way that will be an extension of a sentence (so your Lord has a slave of torment) For those who were subjected to what they have presented to them (P-323), whoever has the pleasure of them is like what the first lies dealt with, that is, God is the one who is the one.And according to the answer to the division, it will be a severity of the

the word of speech, as it was presented to the intended by the oath of what is based on it and the analogy of what was before the punishment See how your Lord did usually), etc., which is a line of discourse, as it makes the Bayan and the endowment with the eclipicating house, and makes the exalted.And the cause, if the words are valid for the adults with the intention of the presenter and the principle of it.The enemy is from the guarantee of the speaker or the name of the Majesty to (your Lord) in his saying: That is his Lord, whom he was victorious, so he is faithful that those who lied to him to be tormented by the victory of him is the victory of his guardian.And the meteorology: the place in which the monotheism is monitored, meaning: the group that surrounds something, and the form of a verb that comes to the place and for the time as it comes to the family, so it comes to the god Obtained, then it is either for the time or place, as the monitoring is sought.And the purpose of the meteorology is the definition of gender, and it benefits the general attachment, meaning: the greeting is for every actor, so it is a representative of the general knowledge of what is the knowledge of God.In the event that the observation is briefed on the enemy and the deceased, and this example is as a result of the reward of every worker with what he did and does it, as he does not mean to the monotheism, and the monotheism is only for the sake It is beneficial to him from the illness of gesture that God did not oppress them as they have been affected by it.And what is in his
