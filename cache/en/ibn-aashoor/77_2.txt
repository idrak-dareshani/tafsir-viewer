The researcher, the messengers, are well -known, as the descriptions are described, and the appeals are published.On the great knowledge of God Almighty and His ability.What is meant by this oath is the affirmation of the news, and in the development of the oath, the Samaqqqqq to meet the division on it.It is permissible for those who are intended to be the descriptions of these attributes are one type, and it is permissible for two or more than the great creatures.The owner of the scout walked on the fact that all of them are angel.And the people of interpretation did not differ that the (masculinity) of the angels.(P-420) Al-Jamour said: Al-Ashfat: The winds, and Al-Tabiri did not rub it in violation.Al -Qarbi said: The angels were said.And (the divisions) did not tell the Tabiri except that they are the angels or the messengers.Al -Qarbi narrated from Mujahid: that it is the wind.As far as this is one of the attributes, the one who was the one who was the one who carried it was the same as those who carried it on the fact that it is the angels, and those who carried it on the wind.The messengers said, Ibn Masoud, Abu Hurairah, Muqtiq, Abu Salih, Al -Kalbi, and Mesrabi: are the angels.Ibn Abbas and Qatada said: It is the wind, and this was transferred from Ibn Masoud as well, and perhaps it is permissible to be paid, and it is the most horizontal with its kindness.And the enemies said Ibn Abbas, Al -Dahhak and Abu Salih: the angels.Ibn Masoud and Mujahid said: The wind, which is on the authority of Abu Salih, also.And it is obtained from this that God was divided into two sons of his great creatures, such as his saying (and the heavens with the brokers and the day of the rituals: 1) Quran.And it is directed in her exposure that the attributes that were composed of fulfillment of the people of what they have been overwhelmed with, and who was overwhelmed by the wow, is the most likely.It is more likely that the messengers and the descriptions are two descriptions for the wind, and that after it is the attributes of the angels, and the second waw of kindness and not the letter of division.And the appropriateness of the collection between these two genius in the section is that both of them are from the high supplies, because the origin is in kindness, and that it is the same.And what came with the disagreement of that is the disagreement of the original, like the saying of the poet, sought by the deceased.To the Qaram and Ibn Al -Hammam, and Layth Al -Katibah in Al -Muzdahm, who wanted one of the rituals of one.And we will speak to these attributes: As for the messengers, if it was made and a description of the angels, the meaning of the messengers was the messengers to the messengers (p-421) He sends it with the life and others from the angels that God sends to some of his prophets with knowledge, news, or victory, as in the saying The angels, and it is a standing prayer that is prayed in the Muharrab [Al -Imran: 39]) Lot, and (a known) is a beneficial condition, meaning of the likeness, that is, the same as the wedding of the horse in the follower of the poetry, some of it, it is said: they are like the one, if they are the same.They came one nose.It is valid for the description of the angels and the description of the wind.And it was interpreted as a name, that is, the hair that is on the neck of the horse and its installation in the case of the way of the likeness, that is, the same as the knowledge of the bone, and the one who is in the same way.A source in the sense of the verb, that is, a known (against the denunciation), and that its installation is on the verb for its sake, that is, for the sake of guidance and salvation.(The descriptions) is a separation on the messengers, that is, they are sent, and they are described, and the corpse is called the power of the wind, so if I want the messengers, the messengers, the sender, the righteousness of the A truth, and if I want messengers and describing the angels, the net is similar to their descent in the speed with the strictness of the wind and that in the beginning in the way in the way Take it.And (a stick) is confirmed to the description of confirmation to achieve the description, as there is no reason to want to raise the imitation of the metaphor.And the publication: its fact is against the fold, and its accommodation is more rewarding in the emergence, clarification, and in the laxity.If it is made and a description of the angels, it is permissible for them to publish them, that is, to repeat their descent for that, and that the publication is a seduction of the clarity, that is Senior.And when he was made with a window for the wind, it is the publication of the clouds in the atmosphere, so it will be his kindness in the wow without fulfillment of the alerts that it is kind to the messengers, not the messengers, not the messengers, not to the messengers, not to the messengers, not to the messengers, not to the messengers, not the messenger A harmful condition and the publication is a state of benefit.And the saying in the affirmation of “publishing” and calling it like a saying in a stick.And the difference: the distinction between the things, if it is a description of the angels, it is valid for the difference (P-422).The tormented nations are distinguished in the world from those who saved them from the torment, such as the people of Noah from Noah, and he returned from Hood, and the people of Lottout It is valid for the metaphoric difference, which is that they come to the revelation that separates the truth and falsehood, and between faith and infidels.And if it is made for the windy, it is one of the effects of publishing, that is, the separation of the withdrawals groups on the country.And to separate the difference in its meanings from the publication of the suffering of the separation of the parties with the fulfillment of fulfillment.He emphasized the divorced acting as he confirmed what he accepted with his saying, "a stick" and "publishing", and it is like that.And Al -Malaqat: The angels who inform the one who is the remembrance.The meeting is a slight to redeem the remembrance from the high world to the people of the earth by similating it by meeting something from the hand to the earth.The meeting of remembrance is the way to the messengers to inform them about people, and this meeting is separated from the difference because they are allocated by all the remembrance of those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones With the supplies And the return with torment, and the remembrance of those who believe in the best and the promise of the blessing.This is a meaning (excuse or vow).The excuse: the media is the acceptance of the faithful of the believers after the disbelief, and the repentance of the repentants after the sins.And the vow: the name of the source is warned, if it is warned.And “excuse” the fans read it with the beard, and it was read by Yaqoub by its guarantee on the follower of the movement of the eye.Nafaa, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Amir, Abu Bakr, read on the authority of Asim, Abu Jaafar and Jacob (a vow) by the guarantee of the humiliation, which is the majority in it.And Abu Amr, Hamza, and Al-Kisa’i, and a thunderboller, read it, and a successor to the places of the one (P-423), who are the one who is mentioned in (excuse), and on the authority Source in the sense of warning.He (excused or vowed) was erected on the insults of (male).And (or) in his saying (or vow) for division.And the sentence (but you promise to happen) the answer to the division and increased, confirming that the piety of achieving the fall of the answer.And (but) are two words, which are (that) that is a confirmation and (what) the connection and is not (but) that is a tool of limitation, and which (what) is increased.This was written in connection (if) (what) because they were not separated in the drawing between the two states, and the drawing is a divorce, and the drawing of the chapter is in the way We write it in separation in interpretation and others.And (what you promise): It is the resurrection of the parts while they know the prayer, so this is a coming in expressing it with the communication.And the rhetoric for the participants, that is, what God promises you from the punishment after the resurrection, and there is no referral, and if you questioned it or you have denied it.And the incident: the constant: the origin of the falling fall on the ground, so it is given to the right to the right.
