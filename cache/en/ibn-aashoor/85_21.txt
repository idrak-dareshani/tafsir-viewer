Because the pen is written in the wave and otherwise.And the glorious: the great in its type, as it is presented in its saying: the glorious throne [Al -Buruj: 15] and the Qur’an is glorified because it is the greatest of the heavenly books He preached, and he increases his eloquence, his eloquence, and his miracle of humanity.It was located in the definitions of the Al -Jarjani master: that the views are four.First: the elderly eliminating the previous judgment on the ritual and the tricks, and it is the first mind.The second: the eloquence of the destiny, that is: the whole spacious soul, which is the fence, the elderly.The third: the ears of the heavenly partial soul in which everything in this world is engraved in its form, its body, and its inability, which is the name of the name.The Funny: The Al -Hayyi is the subject of the image in the world of martyrdom.It is a bump between the Sufism and the sorry, and perhaps from what the master has seized from the words of several scholars.And the audience read the foolishness with the tuning of a lip.And the memorization of the sacrifice in which the Qur’an is as a result of the memorization of the Qur’an.(P-255) And it was read by Nafaa, and he was read by a ram of (a fee) that it is a second characteristic of a Qur’an, and its saying is attached to it: The memorization of the Qur’an is obligated that the deposited lamp is in which there is also an exclusive.As for the memorization of the Qur’an, it is its memorization from the change and the one who stops the demons.As for the elderly, he kept it from the enemy, other than the angels, or its memorization as a manner from his sanctification as his saying: The purchases [incident: 78].* * * (P-256) (P-257) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah Al-Tariq narrated Ahmad ibn Hanbul on the authority of Abu Hurairah: Al -Baraj and Al -Tarq.Abu Hurairah named it: (Heaven and Perfume); Because the appearance is that the waw is one of his saying: the sky and the ritual [Al -Tariq: 1] and the compassion, and for that, the first verse was mentioned, but he took it as a name The sky with the zoop [zodiac: 1].It was called in the books of interpretation and the books of the Sunnah and in the Qur’an (Surah Al -Tarq) To fall into this memory at the beginning.In the interpretation of Al -Tabiri and the rulers of Ibn Al -Arabi, it is imposed (and the sky and the ritual).It is seven ten times.It is an angel with the agreement that came down before the age of ten of the mission, Ahmad ibn Hanbul was brought out from Khalid ibn Abi Jabal al -Adwani: A thunderbolt, which is based on a bow or a stick when they came to them, he would seek the victory, so I heard him say: The heavens and the rituine [Al -Tariq: 1] until it was seen, so he said: Then I read it in Islam.And its number in the installation of the descent of the sixth and thirty lights.It came down after Surah (I do not swear by this country [Al -Balad: 1]) and before Surah (I approached the hour [the moon: 1]).* * * Evidence of statistics of business and penalty on the work.(P-258) And the evidence of the mission is to break what the partners referred to the two bodies that the bodies can be returned.In that reminder of the work of the makers of God and His rule in the creation of human being.And the intention of the Qur’an.And the charity in which the mission was mentioned in it; Because telling the Qur’an with it, when they followed it, and they have gone on to the people that what is in it is not sincere.And threw those who are the ones who have been the Muslims.And the prophet was proven ﷺ and his promise is that God is victorious to Him, without a distance.
