The Quranic researcher, O man, the night, the night, only a few, or a shortage of it, or increased it [Al -Muzammil: 4] The words are opened with the call if the addressee was not one and no On the acquisition of what will happen to the addressee of words.The origin of the call is to be in the name of the call to the knowledge if it is known to the speaker, so it is not amended from the name of the knowledge to other than it is from the description or addition, except for the purpose Ghone and an incompleteness like (O Prophet), or a kindness and a close approach: O my children and my father, or the intention of the insult to the one who is the one who has been You are for the cagis of [Al-Hijr: 6].And for him, and from him the saying of the Prophet ﷺ to Ali ibn Abi Talib, and he has found him in the mosque, and he has commented the dust of the mosque with the authority Lahwayfah ibn al -Yaman on the day of the Khazidaq, “Qom, Nawman”, and his saying to the servant of the Most Merciful ibn Sakhr al -Dawsi and he saw it as a pregnant woman in his life..The appeal of the Prophet (O, the Displaced) is a call of kindness and an agreement, and the same is the saying of the exalted (oh you, the molar [Al -Muddathir: 1]).And the binding: a name that is active from being bound, if it wrapped in its garment like the assistant, or the person who wants the sleep, and it is the same The derivative, the adherence is derived from the meaning of the wrapping, and the impact is derived from the meaning of the disturbance of the burial.And the origin of the adherence is derived from the adapter, with a conquest of being, which is the hidden, and it is not known to (timing) a reaped action in its meaning, so it is from the one who is the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one The cost of the verb, and I want to release the meaning of the confusion, and many like this in the disgrace of the dress, so it is the adulterer and the one who is the adultery And reincarnation, and they may have formulated the formula of the expression, like: he wore and brought up.And the origin of the dominant: the dominant, the tunnel was tweet after the heart of its heart to their approach.This is the synonym that referred to the verse.Al -Zuhri said and the interpreters of the two interpreters: It is the adherence to the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “ After that we have come to him, read in the name of your Lord [Al -Alaq: 1] The verses, as in the hadith of Aroudah on Aisha in the book of the beginning of the revelation from the Sahih al -Bukhar We go to this surah at that time, and it is a truth.It was said that it is what is in the hadith of Jabir ibn Abdullah The people - and they said: A priest, and they said: Crazy, And they said: Warning, and the partners were issued on his description with (a wizard), so he informed that prophet ﷺ, so saddened and tied in his clothes and was disturbed, so he came to him, so he said: (O, the dispensed [Al-Muddathir: 1]).It will come in Surah Al-Muddhar: that the reason for its vision of the king is sitting on a chair between (P-257) the sky and the heaven Khadija, his hearts shivering, and he said, “They are in me” and he will be aware that he caused his call to him, O, the binding, and he was when he said: “Zamalm” Those who are shared by the Sunnah, and that it is not due to its call by (O, the proliferator [Al -Muddathir: 1]) The tissue of the night is a few, and this is a narration from the one.I have treated this matter, and he will do it.The vomiting of his effort in doing the matter of tablig in all of the costumes from night and day, except for a few of the night, which is obliged to it from the hungry in it.The metaphor.(Read in the name of your Lord) Then the Surah of the Pen is revealed to him to refute the article of the partners in which the Walid enlightened the son of Al -Mughara to say: He has to be kind to him on his clothes with his clothes because of his grief from the sorrow of the partners, so God commanded him to pay for him, then he will pay that The revelation, when the king, who was sent to him, saw with the sequences of the severity of the severity of that vision.Al -Muzammil by administering his state of his call to his call, and the smoothness is not a number of the names of the Prophet ﷺ, Al -Sahili said: And he did not know him, and he gave it to him.And the act of (Qom) is a slogan of the obligatory The one who said it (Qom), so warn [Al -Muddathir: 2]).(P-258) Al-Sharafa, so the matter is required by the prayer in all the time of the night.There is a title in the divisions of the Qur’an and Sunnah for the prayer in which there is no way West, dinner and their salaries.And the command of the Messenger by doing the night is a positive matter and is specific to it; Because the discourse is directed to him, just like the light that preceded the descent of this surah, and as for the night of the Muslims, then they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one He will come in his words of exalted: Your Lord knows that you are standing [Al -Muzammil: 20] to his saying: A group of those with you [Al -Muzammil: 20] The verses, the one said: Fifth in the horns of day and night, and perhaps the wisdom of this resurrection, which was imposed on the Messenger ﷺ in the chest To receive the revelation until the revelation does not embarrass him, as he pressed him when we descended as he was mentioned in the hadith of Al -Bukhari, "So he said that he was not one of the words Your Lord, “The Hadith, and this wisdom is indicated by his saying,“ Him, ”we will give you a weak saying [Al -Muzzammil: 5].And the Prophet ﷺ was spent in the cave of Harra Qabil.He insisted on him, so he does not remain a period of time, other than worshiping worship, and this is likely that the night resurrection was imposed on him before the abundance of goodness The nation.The night was dominated by the night of the night of the Messenger of God ﷺ after the abuse of the five prayers, greatness in his affliction with the abundance of the abundance The gay of the revelation and the mobilization of the affairs of the Muslims, and it is the time of the night, as it is indicated by the saying of the Almighty, and from the night, then you will be abandoned by it.Hamid [Al -Israa: 79], meaning: the increase in you.It was presented in the wall of the prime.This was a special wisdom of the Prophet ﷺ, and the jurisprudence mentioned it in the chapter of the characteristics of the prophet ﷺ and it was not a duty of it and it was not imposed on the one who prayed the prayer Fifth.Rather, the Muslims were waiting for the action of the Prophet ﷺ and he acknowledged them on that, so they would see him for a commitment to them, and God has praised them in the same way The exalted, their south, from the dormitory [Al -Sajdah: 16], will come, and that will come when he said: Your Lord knows that you are lower than the three of the nights: Aisha: God was supposed (P-259), the night at the beginning of this surah, the religion and his companions, that there is no disagreement in lifting the prevalence of the one who is the one who will rise.It was decided that he is a delegate in it.And he wrapped in the recitation of his prophets on the Prophet ﷺ and there is no exaltation behind the recipient of that or his numbers.And he said it only a few, excluded from the night, that is: only a few of it, and the positive of the rise of the nights did not comment on the ends of the night.And (his half) is a substitute from (a few), with a custody, and it is two evidence.To do (a little), he made the few here or less than it in a few.And the extension of this gesture is that the guardian is that the resurrection is more than the time of the night and that it made it half of the night as a mercy and a summary of the night He is punished with his saying or a little from him, that is: a shortage of half, so the time for the night is less than his half, and it is a few, and it is a little Specialization.And he said, or he added to him [Al -Muzzammil: 4] and he is a dedication to the desire that the time of the resurrection will be more than half of the night, and for that, it is not restricted (and increased it with it) It was reduced from it to be the increase in the half of the half, and it was mentioned in the hadith that the Prophet ﷺ was taken with determination, and he did not go until it was honored, and it was done.God has forgiven you of what you have given from your sin and what you have been delayed, and he said: “Do not be a servant of thanks?” And the choice that is used from a letter (or) is an perspective in it to the length of the length and the shortness; Because there is a link with the day of the day for work and to take the last luck from sleep.And after, this is a mobilization on the Prophet ﷺ to raise the embarrassment of its determination to the time of resurrection, so he poured into it the proximity of the approach.And the son of Attiyah made the night the name of an angel that believes in all of the Ley, and that the meaning: except a little from the Levant, and it is the Levant in which it is an excuse for it From the loyalty by adopting their parts, not by adopting the parts, then he said (his half) to the last.The night is specialized in prayer in it; Because the time of the sleep is usual, the matter of the Messenger ﷺ in which there is an increase in the work of his concerns by accepting the path of God, and because the night is the time of the time (P-26) So the soul of the person in which it is stronger is in preparation for the receipt of the rabbinic flood.
