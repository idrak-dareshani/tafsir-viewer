The Quranic researcher (P-414), then if you divorce her, do not come to him after you until you marry a husband other than him, then if she divorced her, then there is no ward to them, if he does not think that he will not be bound, if he does not think that they will not be.A two -time period of the divorce [Al -Baqarah: 229] and what is between them in the house of symptoms, that his presentation is caused by an effect in this way, this is what this is in this way; Because he has learned from a group that is that after the two times, it was made between the courage and its numbers, so he went on the fate of the boundary, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one It is indicated by the exclusive way, on the estimation of that, if it is brought in it, then divorce it to the rule of the third divorce.The smoothness may be prepared to receive this judgment from the saying of the divorce two times [Al -Baqarah: 229].His saying is that it divorced it with a increase in the Bayan, and a gift to his saying, so do not be permissible for him after the etc.What is in it, from his saying, is a constipation, if it is intended from the bullied constipation and from the rest of it, that is, if the divorced hold is that of any of it, then the divorce of it, then the divorce of it, then the divorce of it, then the divorce of it It is the appearance, or a shouting of his saying: Or a secret with goodness, if it is intended to relax the events of divorce, that is, if it gets more after the restriction.So do not come to him after, and return this to this direction to arrange for him to prohibit the bull 229] Expressing is the divorce here without the rest of the patience, and for art, on the two prejudices, and it does not need it, and it does not need it, Refer to the divorced divorced person from his saying, two times [Al -Baqarah: 229] and the informed guarantee is a return to the divorce that benefits from the divorce as well, as well To be afraid that the limits of God will not be found [Al -Baqarah: 229] and the verse is a biadness of the right to the right of the bull.The first Islam is decided if what Abu Dawid narrated, in his Sunnah, in the chapter of the reference after the three launching, on the authority of Ibn Abbas: that the man was if he divorced him, then he was divorced.With her return, and if she divorced her three, then we are copying that, and the divorce descended two times [Al -Baqarah: 229].It is not permissible in the case of his words, if he divorces it on a sentence, and it is not permissible for you to take it [Al -Baqarah: 229] and the two guerrillas are not believed to be the one who is true to it [Al -Baqarah: 229], and there is no wing on them [Al -Baqarah: 229] for the sake of the validity of the ruling on the ruling of its saying, then if it divorced it, then do not come to him from what he said.(P-415) is permissible for you to take [Al-Baqarah: 229] Etc., as it is not valid to separate the divorce, which is not permissible after the woman on the fall of the fullest, as it is not among the rulings of Islam in the saying of one of the words of what On the Sunnah of Abi Dawood: that Ibn Abbas broke the formation of immorality, so he dirty that God mentioned the immorality, then he followed him with his saying, then he did not say: If if the immorality was a divorce, the divorce would not have been four, and this is not true of Ibn Abbas, because it was his righteousness to the suffering of the Arabic recovery.And his saying, so that you will not be forbidden for him and mentioned his saying after any of the three divorces recorded on the divorce, and a gesture to the heart The divorced woman is his wife, and his transparency is the right of the pamphlets, until he made it a game that flipped it with the emotions of his anger and his frustration, so he said: The divorced people knew that they were not right in their conditions that they were in the ignorance.What is meant by his saying is a marriage other than that it is complicated by another husband, because the marriage was noticed in the words of the Arabs, and there is no meaning except for the contract Another launch in which there is no truth or metaphor, and days that his release in the words, so what is intended in his verse is the contract with the evidence of his chain of transmission to the woman, for the meaning of the one who is the one The suffering of the marriage with the vision and the metaphor means the politician, it is not supported in the words of the Arabs for the woman in the first place, and this is a joke that they have forgiven in this place.The ruling on this great legislation is the deterrent of the curtains from the transparency of the rights of their waves, and they made them play in their homes, so make the first of the first The second is angry, and the third is a parting, as the Messenger of God ﷺ said in the hadith of Moses and Al -Khudar: Green in the third of this is a difference between me and between you [Cave: 78].And God has arranged the third divorce, and they are the one who is the righteousness of the husband the right Zouj, and the mature of the marriage is a second husband after that to intend to warn the couples from the hurry to the third divorce, except after the reflection, and the one who does not reflect on After it is a hope for the good of the pans, for the knowledge of the prohibition of the return, except after a husband.Three, with a punishment that goes back to the pain of affliction, when it was focused (P-416) in the soul from the severity of the bond from the abode of its wife with another man, and the one who sheds it.Ibn al -Zubayr: ؎ The people of the people, if you inherit your cults and in the land, on the ground of the frying house.The woman is married to the man, and he was married to them after the three, so that they would not be accelerated and to be proven.The Samait knew that the outbreak of the marriage of another husband is an educator for the divorced people, and he was not taken to be the Bebl of one but that it is what is meant by the marriage in the verse, However, the contract is what was a means of what it is intended for most of the construction and after it, the contract that was not punished by it was the dormitory of the booked to Zawj He was intended from him, and the divorced woman is not packed with the jurisdiction of the contract of another husband, in which he did not touch the woman, and for that, “When he divorced the reaction His husband is a daughter of a daughter and a divorce, who went back to the last three, and he married after him Abd al -Rahman ibn al -Zubayr al -Qaruhi, it came to the one who said: God: The reaction divorced me, then I have divided my divorce, and the servant of the Most Merciful ibn al -Zubayr will marry me, but with it like this is the garment of this garment and it is the garment and it is the same as the garment and it is the garment of the ritual The Messenger of God ﷺ You want to return to the reaction, he said yes.Ibn al -Zubayr in the solution of its bit, to the intensity of the intended from the Nakiyyah and the education with the divorced woman, so the scholars of Islam agreed that the marriage is the same The second husband of the woman, and its politicization for it, and does not calculate their evidence in that except the return to the intention of the project, whom he taught, who is a man who understands this We have the conquest of the dates of the recipient that this is from the memorization of the marriage that is intended for it in the specials of this politicized verse or it is from the hadith of reaction, until it is from the The one, or it is from the increase in the text until the dispute comes in it that it is copy It is evaluated, but the consensus of the companions and the people of the tongue on the understanding of this intention is from the memorization of the Qur’an, and it was not removed from that (p-417) He said: It is permissible for the bitterness of the contract on a second husband, and it is anomaly that contradicts the intended; For any extensive, you get from the contract, if it is only a tired of the two contracts, the parents, and the witnesses, except that the judgment makes it a delay in the contract, with the same It is left behind, after it was seen, as a matter of mourning with the thought, and no one is known to him, and the copper attributed it to Said, the son of Said, From him and sponsored him, and God has commanded this judgment, arranged on the third divorce after two divorces, he presented it, so it is obligatory to do so, so it is obligatory to do so To be confined to it, Its rule does not exceed that to every divorce in which the divorced woman is crossed by the three words, or affirmation, or a lie, because that is not a divorce, and no divorce The ruling on the discipline is achieved in it, and the one who is preserved in its first divorce is not mentioned, except as the one who is preserved in it in the first time Secondly, and the purpose of what his article has been acquired is that it is considered in the beans or the liars, so it is not punished with that of separation between him and between his husband, and on the authority of this God ﷺ, and my father is a deception, and a chest of the disagreement of Omar, as he was mentioned in the books of correctness: the one who is the one who is from the authority of the son, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, Ibn Umar when his wife divorced him in the menstruation: He divorced her three in a word, and he mentioned the hadith of “Rukna bin Abd al -Mustabaib One, he asked the Prophet ﷺ and he said to him: God has owned you one, so he commanded him to return it.Then, Omar ibn al -Khattab, in the third year of his disagreement, had tilts of divorce with the three words in one word, and he said: I see the people who have been in the words of the people.They have people in it, so if we have spent it on them, and I will spend it on them.And the scholars of Islam have been destroyed, while those who have seized the divorce of the three are required in a divorce that is not a third: So the gathering said: The three are required of what is the one who is in the past.And his judgment is supported by the silence of the companions, and they were not changed to it, as it is a silent gathering, and based on the similarity of the divorce with the vows and the days, the one who is obligated to do so.A disagreement that Umar ibn al -Khattab was judged by that, and no one was denied by him, but he ruled for that from a domestication, so he is a matter of him, and he did not go to him.They supported him from the companions of the companions, in which there is no evidence in it; Because the silent consensus is not a pilgrimage with the sacrifice of the imams like al -Shafi’i, al -Baqalani, al -Ghazali, and Imam al -Razi, especially that it is a source (P-418) With the massacre of a space for the view, it is not from the consensus that its violator does not.Ali ibn Abi Taleb, Ibn Mas'oud, Abd al -Rahman ibn Uf, al -Zubayr ibn al -Awam, Muhammad ibn Ishaq, and al -Qahj ibn al -Awat, And Al -Dahiriya and a group of the Money of Andalusia: Some of them are Muhammad ibn Zanbah, Muhammad ibn Bin Bin Mukhalid, and Muhammad ibn Abd al -Sa`dah al -Khushan In Qarabah, and the son of the love of the jurisprudence of Qarbah, and Ahmad ibn Mughith al -Taytila ​​al -Fiqai Al -Jalil, and Ibn Tumiyyah said from the Hanabel: The divorce of the three in one word is only one divorce, and it is the most likely from the side of the view and the effect, and they are in the face And the greatest of it is this verse.For his woman: It is a three -divor, and that divorce was not a third of the verb and the repetition was lied in its description that it is three, but it is one or a second, and the second is He returned it to him, and God Almighty did not forbid him.Mitteries are false.The second is that God Almighty intends to expand the expansion of people; Because the pensing does not know the effect of the separation of his clan, then if the husband divorces his wife, the denomination appears to him and the patience is on the authority If he had made the one divorce, it is forbidden with the inception of the memorial from the return, the demolition of the law is disrupted by the proof of the right of the bull.And as if the crowd dominated the ruling of the thickening in divorce, a dam for the sacrifice, but we are invalidated with that of the legitimate summaries and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: After that, it happens after an order [Divorce: 1].The third is the son of Mughith: God Almighty says or westering with goodness [Al -Baqarah: 229] and the site of the three is not good, because there is a leaving it, and this is the one who will be blessed.With a measure on the other hand in the code: from that the human saying: my money is a charity in the poor.Malik said that the third is divided.The lobby took the hadith of Ibn Abbas in Al -Sahih: The divorce of the three was in the time of the Messenger of God ﷺ and my father Bakr and a chest from the disagreement of Omar and a divorce.And the public answered him that his narrators narrated that he had narrated the rest of the companions of Ibn Abbas from him that he said (p-419) who divorced his wife, and he has been disobeyed, They are delusional of the narration of a pea, because the son of Abbas does not violate the companions to see his soul, until Ibn Abd al -Barr said: The narration of a murmur, and the authority of the The people were signing a single divorce, as well as the rhythm of the people, three divisions, which is the meaning of Omar's saying: People have hurriedly in something that you have been in a matter.It was signed in the time of the Messenger and my father Bakr, when Omar said: They hurry, and do not blame him for them, and this is a weak answer.And I say: As for the contrary of Ibn Abbas, when it was narrated, it does not delusion the novel as it was reported in the prayers, and we take his wow.It is not necessary for us to take his opinion, and as for what they interpreted that what is meant from the hadith is that people were signing a single divorce, as well as the rhythm of the three, then the rhythm of the three, so the rhythm of the three It is contrary to the narration and the saying of Omar: So if we have spent it on them, then if it was his light on them, the basis of the covenant of the Messenger, then he did not stay We have spent it on them) and if it was not the same as the past, but it was not a past, the intended was made from the recipient.The fifth is what Darqatni narrated, “The Raqana ibn Abd al -Mutlabi increases the divorce of his husband three in one word, so he asked the Messenger of God, so he said: It is one, so return it." The supporters of the Republic answered him that it was a compelling hadith; Because he narrated that a volcano divorced, and in a narration that he increased the son of Rakan, he divorced and in a novel that divorced his wife three and increased in some of the narratives that he divorced it three and said: So the Prophet ﷺ walked into it.It is a wow answer; Because it is true that the leadership was authenticated, or did you not correct the prophet ﷺ with the extent in it in it in it for the three, and he did not say from the gathering, then the hadith is not the hadeeth It is a case, except that his narration is not in a prestigious arrangement of health.Sixth, what Darqatni narrated in the hadith of the son of Omar Omar, his wife, when the Prophet’s command, ﷺ is to return it until you purify it, then you will be more In it that he divorced it three and did not doubt that it was three in a word, because if it was a divorce, the last of the last three came back, so it is not permissible to return it to it, It is reversed, so it is only one, and this is a very weak indication of the weakness of the narration and for the fact that this is the same as what is not the same as the narrators of the Correctional is like the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The truth is that it only falls on one divorce and does not accommodate the saying of the divorced three.The fighter and the Dahid al-Zahiri went in a narration from him that the divorce of the three in one word (P-420) does not fall out of time, and he is exalted that the Qur’an is mentioned and mentioned.The group is not obligatory because it is not mentioned in the Qur’an.And if he was brought up to them that he was forbidden from him and the one who was a pioneer for him was a relative, if not for corruption that corruption does not accommodate immorality, and this is an anomalous and void, and a gossip, Doing it, and how it does not fall into the divorce.Ibn Jabir, Ata and Ibn Dinar and Jabir Bin Zaid went until the divorce of the baking is three in a word that falls on one divorce, because it is before the construction of the building, as it is the same Their saying in it: that the meaning of the three in it is a seduction of the evidence and the divorce before the construction is shown by the one.He described a husband other The third divorce, because it is the remembrance of the seductive, remember that his wife will be easier for others as the hadith of the preacher, who is glorified by the greatness Its indication and its conversation ∗∗∗ and tomorrow for you, it is its urbanization and the disobedience and the support of the return to the separators in the form of the effect of the reaction to stop it on the consent This was commented on his saying that they are afraid that the limits of God will not be found [Al -Baqarah: 229]) That is, that he will come in the future of the good of the pensions, otherwise there is no extension in returning the return.And the limits of God is his rulings and parts, similar to the limits because the cost does not crown it, as if he stands at it.The truth of the limits is the communication between the two lands and the like, and it has been presented in its saying, except that they are afraid that the limits of God will not be found [Al -Baqarah: 229] and the residence is the arrogant.To settle the limits to the rulings, as their saying: We have broken down his spin, and his saying, and that is the limits of God, shows it, so the Bayan is good for the sake Because the residence of the reinforcement is in it, there is a bias for the two views.What is meant by people know, those who understand the rulings, understanding them to work for them, and with the awareness of their reconciliation, and they do not refer to understanding it.* * * And that is the limits of God, showing it for a people who know the waw is a symptom, and the sentence is opposite between the two sentences: the one who is on the authority of the one, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, The sentence is like a sentence that is the one that is the limits of God, so do not accommodate the advanced.(P-421) And God is presented to her.And the identification of the limits of its male to the people is clear, detailed, tall, and its saying is suspended for a people who know with the verb that shows it, They know the erasure of the intensity of those who realize what is in the rulings of God from reconciliation, and it is an illusion of the merchants who are exposed to the followers of Islam.And the omission of the word (a people) for the permission that the adjective of knowledge is their prostration and a king in them, as it is presented with his saying when he said: The night and the day [Al -Baqarah: 164] to its saying, verses of people who are reasonable [Al -Baqarah: 164].
