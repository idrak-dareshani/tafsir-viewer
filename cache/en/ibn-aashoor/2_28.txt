The Quranic researcher, you disbelieve in God, and you were a holy, so I will protect you, then he will protect you, then he will live for you, then you will return to you O people, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you [Al -Baqarah: 21], after he commented with the spanns of the sentences that are exposed to the one who said: The righteous that they have paradise is running [Al -Baqarah: 25] to his losers saying [Al -Baqarah: 27] and not in his saying, how do you disbelieve in God, the suitability of God, there is no saying that God does not say that God does not say He sets for example [Al -Baqarah: 26] and after what he narrated from those who disbelieved in their saying, what God wanted with this, for example [Al -Baqarah: 26] until he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one You disbelieve the tattooing, as the appropriateness is between the occurrence of this verse, after what before it is the occasion of the union of the present, after the severity of what it was disturbed and exhibited.And from the sake of the occasions and the longing of art in the dispute of resignations in the speeches, if you are the hearts that the matter of the worship of God Almighty is in the words of God [Al -Baqarah: 21] Etc.Is the heart in which the denials of the worship, and it is the disbeliever in it, the Almighty in his saying here, how do you disbelieve in God, and he said: Before you, you may fear [Al -Baqarah: 21] who made you the land with a bed and the sky with a constructive [Al -Baqarah: 22] the verse and he said here and you were honest, so I will give you and then he will give you You are the one who created for you what is in all the earth and then settled to the sky [Al -Baqarah: 29] and that was the principle of disturbing to what he would have received from the beginning of the creation And its phases.The discourse in his saying is atone for a person who is his return to (people) and they are the partners because the Jews did not disbelieve in God, nor denounce the second life.And how is a name that does not know its detection, indicates a special condition, which is said to the entire proportions to (P-374) how, and the meaning of the question is included in the most.His affiliation was in the case in the asset of names, because he benefited a meaning in itself, except that the highest meaning that was indicated by it, when it was the meaning of it, the meaning of it, the meaning of the person, with the meaning The understanding is strong with his likeness to the forefathers, but it does not come out of the characteristics of the names, so he must have no more than a place of Arabization, and the most abundant of the nations is the most important.It is understood about the general situation.And the understanding here is used to be amazed and denying the category of his saying, and you were honest, etc., meaning that your disbelief is with that situation, so that it is not that it is not The archive soul is the existence of what he knows about, which is the remote states after that, so it was from it to be denied, so the denial is generated by the meaning of the Therefore, he recovered from them from the will to be noticeable, and as if the denial wants to cut the excuse of the addressee, and he will appear to him that he will appear to him.The reason is that the denial and the wonders are overwhelmed, even if it does not appear that it was right and the day.The infidelity is to be a listening source of the disbelief of the three -year -old, and the origin of the nickname is the blessing of the blessing, and it is derived from the substance And covering up because the one who was unaware of the grace has hidden the confession with it, as it was announced to declare it.And it is the righteousness of the thank you, and therefore it is a form of a source of the adultery of the thank you, and they also said that there are no infidels on the weight of thanksgiving.On the authority of the most disbelieving of the grace, as the worship of those who have been blessed with him at the time of the time of the hamats, he has disbelieved in that hour, when he was in the time of that time, when he is in the time The blessing and the blessing of the blessing when it is determined to go to the righteousness, and because it is determined by itself on the perpetuation of that, the ritual of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart It is overlooked for that, so it was more released by the infidelity in the form of the source in the Qur’an on the partner of God, and the infidels did not return in the form of the source of the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in God.Licked the roses of the verb of disbelief or the description of the infidel in the Qur’an for the pharaoh of Muhammad al -Muhammad ﷺ and so where there will be a consort on the will of that as the one who says it is like that Among the people of the book or the participants [Al -Baqarah: 105] and his saying, and whoever does not judge what God has revealed, for those who are the disbelievers [Al -Ma’idah: 44] He wants Jews.As for his release in the Sunnah and in the words of the imams of Muslims, it is the belief that brings his belief from Islam and what is indicated by that belief from the one who does not say It is not possible for that.The release of the disbelief in the words of the Messenger, peace be upon him, and the words of some of the predecessors (P-375), was rejected by a great germination in Islam, release on the face The useful of the pioneer of the composition of what is permissible for the people of the infidels, but some of the divisions of Muslims are clinging to the back of this On the adherence of the cabares, and they do not fulfill what is opposed to that in the consequences of the words of God and His Messenger.And the separation of Muslims disagrees with the fact that the composition of some of the deems of which are entered into what the infidels are, and that the proof of some attributes to God Almighty or the righteousness Inside in what the disbelief is on the sake of all, and the people of the truth are gone from the predecessor and the successor that no one of the Muslims disbelieves with guilt or sins of the sins or sins The sins were committed to the time of the Messenger of God ﷺ and the creative, so they did not treat the criminals of the treatment of those who are in the religion, and the saying With the atonement of the disobedience, it is dangerous for religion because it is interpreted to the dissolution of the university of Islam, and it is inspired by the singer, the slander of Islam, as a chant of me.No one is atoned for the descriptions of God that does not contradict his fullness, nor deny a row from it, which is not in its negation, a decrease in its might In its negation except for the abuse of God, the Almighty, and they may have exhausted in that, as the dismissed denied the attributes of the suffering and the permissibility of the vision of God, the exalted Except the risk of his words, as well as some of the wealth and saturation with their reward, that God does not resemble the animals.And faith is mentioned with it with the saying of those who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3] and his saying and you were honest, so I will give you a state of time, and it is a state (How) by the way of the bulls and the first indications of the evidence for its existence and its ability, and it is what everyone feels that it was found after a long time.And his saying has been exalted and you were honest, so I will revive you that this creation in a state of obedience is that the human being was a crime of things that are described by the death of any of the dead, that is, there is no life, that is, there is no life in it The dispersed elements in the air and the land, so they gathered in the food, which is a second supply dead, and then the mixture was used from the blood, and others, and it is dead, then it is dead, then it is dead.The two sides of the male and the female, then it was mixed and became a relationship, then chewing all of these phases of priority for the existence of the human being, which is the stretches of the dead, then the time of the time, then it is a time By blowing the soul, so he took in life to the time of the place, and after it, and it was their right to be satisfied with it as a sign of his righteousness with the highness.And the release of the dead here is a great metaphor based on (P-376) that the death is the number of equality of the body with life, whether it was described by it before, as it is the launch of the lament in the mother He described it if it is from it to be described by it, so on this, it is said to the lives at the first formation of its sperm, the relationship, and the one who is a matter of it.With life, then the launch of the homes in this verse is upon them when they were not described by life with great release, and the intended for it is the one Treatment and approach to his saying, then he will die and then revive you and he said a lot of the imams Dahir, and on it, the launch of the dead in them in the case of the precedent on the solutions of life.The whole agreed that it is a great launch in the Qur’an, so it is not a truth, as it is a famous metaphor that may be equal to the truth and the conflict is removed.And life against the death and it is in the view of the law, the soul of the soul in the body, and it may be difficult to know Life or the definition of its inceptions on the advanced and delayed philosophers, a realistic definition of the limit, and clarifies its nooking by the drawing that it is the one who is the same And it is a coordination with the accustomed to the mood and the main depression in which the bloody circle is used, and it is intended for the special composition that is appropriate for what is appropriate The compounds, and that installation is obtained from the equivalent of strength and parts, according to what was required by the case of the rich thing with the ritual of the ritual That installation is the type, and for every kind of that species is a mood that specializes in the increase in the installation, and for every person from the coffee, it is a mood, and it is a mood, That mood on the special system.The life in the mood is sent in the two breaths of the soul in it, and it is the expression of it with the spirit of the Nafiqi.And he referred to this formation of the hadith of the trauma on the authority of Abdullah ibn Masudi that the Messenger of God ﷺ said, “Your one of your creation is in his man Then it will be a relationship like that, then it will be chewing like that, then the king is sent to him, and he will be blown up in the spirit.It is appropriate for life in which life was sent, and then with the system of that mood, life is used and with its choice, life will be removed, and that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Ceach in it in which the obedience of the life of the soul is the blood, and if the blood is dispersed, it is a corruption of it, and a corruption, and the presentations of the condition of the work of the mood and the disruption of the effects of its effects The dead is like the condition of the diced, and the condition of the boundary, then if it is cut off (P-377), the mood is done, then the death.The death is a nomad and life is a king, and both of them are a created supply.Let the intended one of his saying and you are honest, so I will give you the best.The struggle of his saying shall form the words and his saying, then he will die in the context of the verse.As for his saying, then he lives for you, then you will return to it, so there is a separation from the recipient, and it is not with an indication, as the partners are denied, and the life is denied And it is not in terms of cursing, or the indication of the evidence is that there is a second life that has risen of the status of knowledge with it, and if the knowledge does not get, then everyone who knows the good People do not run on the requirement of its orders and its talents, so the spoil is seen in the land in the grace and the righteous in the hope of knowing that the justice and wisdom Life is the most judgment and amended from this life that is the conditions of people in it Their entitlement and the name of their entitlements.And his saying, then to him, to return to it, that is, your return to it, the likeness of the presence of the reckoning with the hurry of the walking to his house, with the absence I attended it, then if the death lives after the death, then they returned them to it, and this is a proof of the crowd and the penalty.And the one who is attached to his worker is the beneficial of the shortness, which is a true short, for those who address the addressees to benefit them, if they were denying that Their idols are for them, as the participants need Muslims that if they are a mission and a misery, they will find the gods to support them.And (you return) by the guarantee of the vita and the opening of the gym in the readers ’readings, and read it, Jacob, with the opening of the Tax and the fracture of the gym, and the first readings on the authority of God.Because they denied the resurrection, and the second readings by adopting the fall of the return from them by cutting the view of the choice or algebra.
