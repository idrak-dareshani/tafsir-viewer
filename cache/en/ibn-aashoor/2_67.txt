The researcher, when Moses said to his people that God commands you to slaughter a cow, he said: “We take us shaking,” he said.From the stories of the sons of Israel, it appeared in it from the lack of regret for their prophets and from the curses in the question and the urbanization in it either to detail from the compliance, or for the sake The intention of the street and their romance is the eagerness of what is not intended.It was said that the first of this story is the reminder of the saying of the Almighty, and when you killed a soul, then you will be repeated in it [Al -Baqarah: 72] The verses, and if you say that God is the one who is God A cow arising from the killing of the mentioned soul, and if Moses said it was here because the speech of Moses, peace be upon them, has arisen from him from the one who is in the way Project, which is the transparency of the matter - when they thought they were mocking - and the insults are in the question, so I want to present the part of the story, the number The scouts and the faces of his words, and it is not hidden that what they directed to it is the part of the story of the story.And with the meeting of the arrangement, the blame may be known for its story and the alert to it, with the grace of its saying, I seek refuge in God that I will be from the ignorance and what is the one who is the one Who appears to me that they are two stories, the first, which is the storyteller here, is a matter of mosaic to them with a sacrifice of a cow, and this is the story that I referred to the trusteeship in the traveler, and it The second legitimacy (triangle) in Al-Asahi 21 is that if a dead man is found, it is not known to be killed, then the villages are closer to the location of the murderer (P-547), and it will come out.A calf from the cows that he did not plow on it and did not escape with the minor, and they will come to it to a permanent valley.The priesthood is from the children of Lawy, and it will be washed by that village, their hands on the hurry in the valley, and they say, “We do not regret our hands, these blood, and you did not see it.And the blood will be forgiven for them.Thus, the story was mentioned by the exaltation of the intended and the father of the widening of this sacrifice, is it the waste of that blood, or is it when it is excused, and it is not the same This is a hidden cow of all the killing of a soul that ignored its killer, and it is the one who refers to it here, and then what happened to kill the dead, who killed him, who killed him and killed him.The appearances of demanding with his blood, and that descent was descended on the day of the cow's sacrifice, so God commanded them to strike the murderer with some of that It is slaughtered when a murderer is ignorant of a soul.And that appears to the face of their stories, and the Qur’an has the same remembrance of the two storytelling, because the subject of remembrance and the lesson from them is what happened in their way Do not detail the facts, so the first story was a legitimacy before its remembrance of what it compared to the receipt of the matter with the many question that indicates the weakness Things that cannot be thought to be committed to the legitimacy of it, and the second story was from them with a verse of God and miraculously from the miracles To increase faith, and for that, I have been sealed with his saying and shows you his verses, so that you may be reasonable.His saying is that God commands you as a story for what is crossed by Moses from the fulfillment of this news that was fell in the Arabic, and it was confirmed.And their saying, we take our right to be a true understanding that they thought that the matter is a sacrifice of a cow to the desirability of the blood of a killing, and we will take us.Bayan is the origin of the act of taking it with his saying, I take the idols of deities in the Surah of Anam and the shaking of the sacrifice A mock, and it is a source in the sense of the verb like the master and creation.And the generosity (mocking) was read by two guilts after the zai, a prayer and a stand, and the hamzah was read by the costume of the Zai, with the gossip, and the stood up, It was drawn in the Mushaf, and it was read, and a thunder was read by the addition of the zai and the reduction of the gambling, and the waqf and the stand.(P-548) Moses said I seek refuge in God to be from the ignorant people who innovate and be removed from the mock because he does not follow the minds of the virtuous, for it is more than the one who is more With a hole and a conversion to the mood with it, it is not met in the general and discourse, that he does not fit the status of the Messenger, and that is what is from it The ignorant people are from the exile of the scandal with the exile of his obligation, and in the rituals of his saying, I seek refuge in God, that is, from it, because the goodness of God is the word of God.The woman does not seek refuge in God unless he wants to overcome a great matter that only God Almighty will overcome.And the form of being from the ignorance is the most abandonment of the ignorance of the ignorance of that if he said, I seek refuge in God to be ignorant, as it will come in the wall of Anam when he said, and what I am from the words of the And against the dream, and he returned to them in the words of the Arabs, for the first of the words of Amr ibn Kalthaum: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Al -Hamasi is not a matter of ignorance and the saying of the nap
