The Quranic researcher surrounded what they have, and I have all the same, the case, the case or the symptoms; Because it is an advent that is a predecessor for a sentence to know that they have abolished the messages of their Lord, that is: he surrounded all the messengers of the messenge That is, so he said it and surrounded what they had to do so that he was specialized in what he accepted with his knowledge by crying over them.I am after some blindness.He expressed the knowledge of the statistics on the interest of the boss, similar to the knowledge of things with the knowledge of the numbers; Because the numbers are stronger, and its saying (nomination) is a nomination for the settlement.And the number: the jaw is a name for a number, and in slurring is a source of enemy.The Arabs separated the source and the active; Because the verb is in the name of the source, it is a distance from slurring; Because the origin is in the slurring of the verb.* * * (P-252) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of the Mass.It is permissible for him to be intended for the story, and it is permissible for the prophet to be desired by the state that we would like to say in his saying, O Lord, O Mazmil.[1] Ibn Attiyah said: It is in the saying of the gathering an angel, except for the saying of the Almighty that your Lord knows that you are lower than the nights of the night [Al -Muzammil: 20] Al -Qaribi narrated like this about the trick.And he said in Al -Iqtana: The deepening of his saying is that your Lord knows that you are lower than two thirds We will go down the chest of the surah in a year, and that was the abuse of the night at the beginning of Islam before the abuse of the five prayers.(P-253) It means all of it with Mecca, that is: all the surahs are an angel, so you can say that the saying of the night [Al-Muzammil: 2] And the narratives appear on that his saying that your Lord knows that you are rising [Al -Muzzammil: 20] to the last of the Surah, we are separated from the descent of what he accepted in the end of it.Aisha: He came down after the chest of the Surah in a year.And the same was narrated by al -Tabiri from Ibn Abbas.In two years.It is clear that the most correct is that we go down (your Lord knows) to the last of the Surah, we have come down to the city of his saying, and others are fighting in the way of God: 20] With an absence on the face of miracle.Al -Tabiri narrated on the authority of Saeed bin Jabir, who said: When God revealed to The Prophet ﷺ O, the binding, the Prophet’s stay ﷺ in this case, the ages of two years, the night will take place as God command Ten years, your Lord knows that you are rising [Al -Muzammil: 20] to the prayer of prayer [Al -Muzammil: 20] uh, meaning: the other verses have come down in the city by building that the abode of the Prophet was Two years, and it is a hidden one.And the accounts of Aisha are obligatory, some of which require that the surah is all an angel and that its chest was descended before the last of it in a year before the premature of the prayer Mastering.This requires that the first of the surah was descended with Mecca, and some novels say in it: It was spreading to the Messenger of God ﷺ to the one who is the one who is blessed with the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one So they gathered, and he was angry, and he was afraid that he would write to them the night and go down, O Mazmam [Al -Muzammil: 1] Rest of the night except for a few [Al -Muzammil: 2] With the home of the flood and abundantly, the most famous of that is the most famous of them, then God will know that your Lord knows that you are the lowest of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one [Al -Muzzammil: 20], and he turned them to the Faradhah and put the navigate from them.This is what Al -Tabiri narrated by two sides to Abu Salma ibn Abd al -Rahman on the authority of Aisha, and it requires that the surah is all civil; Because the prophet ﷺ was not built with a mosque except in the city, and because its saying “he came out anger”, it requires that he came out of his house, which is the one who is in his mosque, I prove the night in its mosque.(P-254) Perhaps this obligatory is a disorder in the novel between the abuse of the night and the ritual of the ritual in it.Al -Qarbi attributed the interpretation of Al -Thalabi said: Al -Nakhwi said in his saying, O Head, O, the bambling [Al -Muzammil: 1] The Prophet ﷺ was dominated by a cat.His half on it while she is asleep and his half on the prophet ﷺ and he prayed uh, but the Prophet ﷺ built with a murder in the city, for whom we are blessed with the authority that we are not.A load, as we will show him when he said, "We will give you a weak saying [Al -Muzzammil: 5], and that his saying that your Lord knows that you are the one who is righteous [20] In the city after two years from the first of the Surah; Because there are people in it for the duty of the night, and that it is a copy of the duty of the night from the Prophet ﷺ and that what he narrated from Aisha is that the first thing is the one who did not come.Prayer is strange.Al -Qarbi narrated from Al -Muddi: that Ibn Abbas and Qatda said: Ayati, and they are patient with what they say [Al -Muzammal: 10] to his saying and their lust [11] In the city.And he disagreed with the exclusion of this surah in the installation of the lighter, and the most correct The authentic news was added to him: that the first of the walls of the relationship and the disagreement, as it descended after the surah of the relationship, then said: Surah (N and al -Qalam).The script, and it appears that it is more likely to be said, and then it was said that the surah of the mandate after the pen, then it will be third.This is the saying of Jabir bin Zaid in the number of the light of the light, and according to the saying that the one is the second.It is necessary that the pen will be third and the sequence, and it is necessary that the seed be the third and the pen is a severity, and the prevailing is that the one who has been in the past It is the appearance of the hadith of Araba ibn al -Zubayr on the authority of Aisha in the beginning of the revelation from the Sahih al -Bukhari, and it will come when it is the Almighty saying (O Mazmil: 1).It is more correct that we are descending (O jammah [Al -Muzammil: 1]) What is in the hadith of Jabir Bin Abd Allah, who is coming when he said: Oh, O Mazmal [Al -Muzammil: 1]).It was considered to be the people of the city of ten times, and in the past of the people of Basra nine ten, and in the exception of one of them one of them.* * * Its purposes are the notice of the softening of God, the Almighty, his Messenger ﷺ by calling him with his description of his adherence.(P-255) And I was included in the matter by the arrival of the Prophet ﷺ most of the night, and the praise is on a group of believers who set themselves up to the night.And on the confirmation of the Prophet ﷺ by carrying the informing of the revelation.And the command of the sustainability of prayer, the payment of zakat and the giving of charity.And his command of the incitement of the resurrection of what God has commanded from Tablig and that he relies on it.And command it to symptoms of the actors.And God will be guaranteed to Him with victory over them and that their reward is in the hand of God.And the return to them with the torment of the hereafter.And their preacher from what happened to the people of Pharaoh, when they lied to the Messenger of God to them.And the remembrance of the day of resurrection and the description of his family.And copying the righteousness of the night of the night by the fulfillment of some of it to be carried out for the mandatory excuses.And the promise of the great penalty on the verbs of goodness.And the initiative with repentance, and the literature of the Qur’an was integrated and enlightened.And that the day of the day does not enable the night.In this surah, the positions of the savings and the weighted books are perpetuated, so you should manage it.
