evaluation, and the exaggeration is in it on both of the two ads.And the truth is what his Sibui has gone to.There is no disagreement between the people of the language in the fact that the two descriptions are indicative of the exaggeration in the characteristic of the mercy, that is, it is possible and attached to it as a lot of the travelers in the From them, and they are extensively in
