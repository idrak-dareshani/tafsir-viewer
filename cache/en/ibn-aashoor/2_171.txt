The researcher is the one who has disbelieved as the same as the one who obstructs what is heard except a supplication and a deaf call that is blind In symptoms until he reached his saying, and if they were said to them, follow what God has revealed, they said, but follow what we have left for our fathers [Al -Baqarah: 170], and he mentioned that he is a matter His saying and from the people who take from God without a dazzle [Al -Baqarah: 165] the verse, so what is meant by those who disbelieve those who are the same is the example here is the eye Whoever takes from God is a dumping [Al -Baqarah: 165], and the intention of those who are unjust in his saying, and if you see those who have been wronged [Al -Baqarah: 165] and seek the people in the people of the people, who is the people of the people In the land, a good permissible [Al-Baqarah: 168], and the intention is to destroy the absent in his saying (P-111) and if it is said to them, all of that followed with a condemnation of the same in the case They have an example, and the benefit of the representatives was presented at the saying of the exalted, the same as the same as the one who lost a fire [Al -Baqarah: 17].Rather, he composed him with wow here, and he did not separate him as his saying was proverb, like the example They have to receive the call of Islam, and if he did not overcome it, it would not have been correct.And the example is here when I was added to those who disbelieved, it was a phenomenon in their similarities, when they were heard the call of the Prophet ﷺ to them to Islam in the case of the one who is in the case They do not understand except that the Prophet ﷺ calls them to follow it from otherwise he will see in the evidence of his sincerity and the validity of his religion, so all of the situation is the same Things: a reason, a supplication, a call, a understanding, a symptom, and a silence, and each of the things that are things that are the parts of the compound likeness, to be good, because it is a part of the part of the part With it, and this is one of the creators of the representation, and the verse has been briefly briefly, and the intended is the same as the state of the disbelievers, not the case, and it is followed by the case And if he called him, and the atonement is here two states: they are the case of symptoms from the call of Islam, and the second is the case of the innervation of the worship of the idols, and the two states may be included He said it, and if it was said to them, follow what God has revealed, they said, but we follow what our fathers have fulfilled [Al -Baqarah: 170] and the greatest of the idols of idols, so this is the same for the same.The precedent.If you say: The phenomenon is required to say: the example of those who disbelieved as the same as the sheep who obstructs; Because the disbelievers are the likes and who are imbued with the arrogance of the disbelievers, so why did he change from that?And is this robe indicates that the intended is the prophet ﷺ in his prayers for them who is obstructed?I said: No The two things are average; If his saying: And the example of those who are sworn in that it is likened to a bone form, as it was presented in his saying, the highest of them is like the example of the one who was the one who did not say: The parts of the two compounds are not visible to them, and which is mentioned in the side of the likely and the compound that is likened to it The indication of the compound similar to what is met by the masculine in the compound is like the like, as the same as the example of the one who lost a fire.God Almighty said the same as what they spend in this worldly life as a wind in which it is bitter [Al -Imran: 117] the verse.And who meets what is spent on the side of the likeness of it is the saying of the plows of people and said the example (P-112) Sanabel [Al-Baqarah: 261] Rather, who meets those who spend on the side of the likeness of it, is the hedge of the love, and it is not mentioned in the word originally, and he said.People do not believe in God and the last day, so the example of it is the same as the dirt on which it is dust The authentic hadith: “The example of Muslims, Jews, and Christians, as a man, who hired the procedures”, etc.His reward for Muslims and others who believe before us, and it is not mentioned in the side of the likeness in the first place, and it is a lot of sophistication, and it is very much.For those who are interpreters here are the merits of the meaning of the meaning, and the verse bears that what is meant is that it is similar to the state of the partners in their symptoms of Islam, with the case You like the state of the participants in their inhabitants in the case of the case for the sheep, and whatever it is, the sheep hears the voice of supplication and the call, and there is no understanding of what is not.They were not guided by the evidence that the Prophet came to ﷺ, so his saying is only a supplication and a call from the complement of the descriptions of some of the parts of the compound.This is good because it is a murderous to be a similar if it is intended to be similar to the partners with a little perception, and that it will be a bell in the suspicion, if it is the one that is the one who is like it.The idols when they invite the partners with sheep when their raings are fond of them, so they only hear a supplication and a call, and it is known that the idols do not hear, no prayer Like his saying, it is like a carpentry or more cruel [Al -Baqarah: 74] Then he said, and from the carpentry, the rivers are separated from it [Al -Baqarah: 74].And those who were evaluated that the representation should be on one of the two ways, and when the collection is possible between them [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
