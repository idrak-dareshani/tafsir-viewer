The Quranic researcher, if you are traveling, and did not find a writer of a consequence.This is given to his saying: If you come with a debt [Al -Baqarah: 282] the verse, then all of what the ruling is presented in the presence and the place, then if they are on the authority of the book For the good of those who write and testify, they have been agitated by another ruling, which is the rak'ah, and this is the last of the signed sections in the images of the transgressive, which is the case What is traveling in this state.The betting is a mortgage collection, and it is also gathered on a threat to the light of the Arabs and the distraction of the distraction.The twentieth gambling was read by the breaking of the Arabs and the opening of the distraction, and Ibn Katheer read it, and Abu Amr: the guy of the Arabs and the distraction, and the gathering of it, and the gathering Judgment.And the mortal is a name for the bitter thing as a name for the one who is the source of the source like creation, and the meaning of the rak'ah: to make something of the benefits of the debt His debt, and the origin of the mortgages in the words of the Arabs indicates the love.Zuhair said: ؎

children, and maybe they have stipulated that one of their chanters, he said that the elderly remembers that Their children: I did not give it from our children ∗∗∗ their struggle, so we spoil them as someone who has spoken (p-121) and Abdullah ibn Hammam al-Salali said: I survived and insulted their money and from the hadith as the core of the son of Al -Ashraf that he said to the servant of the Most Merciful ibn Awf: they bet on your children.And the meaning of (a vineyard): that is, a vineyard with which the writing is compensated by, and its description of the vicinity of either the regeneration of the revelation; Because betting is only a tribal, or for the exit from the mortgages to trust in the debt in the presence.It is taken from the ears in the mortgages that it is permissible.So if the Lord of the debt asks him, he will answer him, so the verse indicated that the mortgages are documented in the debt.And the verse is indicative of the fierceness of the mortgages in the travel with its scent, and the holy pioneer in the presence in the presence, because it is attached to it in the case of the travel, not to know.Rather, it is a relationship in the sense of imposition and estimation, if the witness is not found in travel, then there is no concept of the condition for his roses, and it is not for a state of no, not for a special situation The concepts of the qiyud, unless the boundaries of the bound, do not accuse them, and therefore they are not used to it if it comes out of the prevalence of the majority, and there is no concept of it in the authority of the testimony of the testimony, as well The verse is that the mortgages are known to them.And it has He took Mujahid, the laughter, and the Dahdi al -Zahiri, with the vice of the verse from the threat of mortgages in the event of travel, with the fact that the Sunnah has proven the rituals of the rak.The presence.The verse is evidence that the arrest is one of the mortgages of the mortal, and the scholars did not differ in that, but they disagreed with the rulings that are arising from the leaving of the arrest.The validity of the mortgagee of the appearance of the verse, and if he did not compare the contract of the mortgages, the neck of the contract was raised with it, and Muhammad ibn al -Hasan said: With the two tribes, and the late people repeated from Hanafi in accordance with this phrase, so he said: He has a condition in health as a saying (P-122) A condition in the necessity is close to the saying of Malik, and the whole agreed that the wickedness has to return after the hopper The necessity, because the mortgages are a contract that proves the formula like a sacrifice, and the arrest of its boundaries, so the Most -of the mortar is forced into the mourning of the time, if it is the time Before motivation, the mortgagee was the end of the sunset; If he does not have what he affects the rest of the place, and the verse is witnessing this because God made the arrest and a description of the mortgage, so he did not know what The grip, and the people of Yunus, should be satisfied with the horse of the Lord and the property in the domain of the property.And in the verse is an indication that is clear on the heroes of the integrity, because God Almighty has made the mortgages a compensation for the testimony in the documentation, so there is no face of the intended, and the intended, and the intended.On his behalf, he turned to what he is selling.* * * If some of you are safe, let him be guided by his trust, and God will fear God.A separation of all the provisions of the debt: that is, if each of the two seen, one of the other two years is safe The marvelous is the creditors, and some are the one who is the one who is careful.The honesty is a source of security: if he makes it safe, and security is the most reassurance of the soul and its peace from what it fears, and the safety is released on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one On the verb, and the addition of (his safety), the addition of the source is likened to its effective, and the remembrance of the safety will come in the sense of the righteousness of the mother when I say: [Al -A'raf: 68] In Surah Al -Arf.Here the name of safety has been released on the debt in the dhimma and on the mortgages to greatly attach the truth because the name of the trusts has the release of the souls, so then the warning of it; Because when he was called a safety, his performance was reflected in betrayal; Because it is against it, and in the hadeeth: “Do the safety to whom you are not safe and do not betray Whoever betrays you.It is commanded by the trusts to its people [women: 58] and the meaning: If you think that you are in a richness from the trust in your debt, that you are the trusts of you, so that you will be.From what he said with the Almighty saying: (So write it) that a verse is that some of you are safe for some, so let him perform the one who believes in his safety, and you will be considered to be a good.He asked to be delegated and fascinated by those who carried the matter in his saying, “So, write it” in the sense of scarring and fools, and they are the meaning, and the meaning The request is that it was clear that the writing and the martyrdom between the two weighing, the goodness of the goodness between them, if they seemed to be in them, and it is for them, and it is for them, and it is a matter He knows it from safety between them, so they left them.Writing and martyrdom on the debt was obligatory and then copying his duty, claiming that his people are his words of exalted Jarraj, Jabir Bin Zaid, and Al -Raba’i Bin Solomon, and we were attributed to Abu Saeed Al -Khudari.By copying, the generals of the states and the elders are allocated, and the name is like that, the name A judge, and among them is the tuber, so they shortened a verse, for if some of you are safe, some of them are the same.In a clear words in that, but it is the case of the words and its oppression.Some of you are the ability: if you do not find a mortgage and a sake of each other to (P -124), the last of it - then he has a face, and he does not understand that he did not.But this is a desire for people in the honesty and the honesty, and all the three groups are all of them make this verse be packed in the case The debt.By creativity, and for this joke, I am the inspiration of those who are accredited to the word “some” to include the guys from both sides: who is from the Lord of the Lord.The Lord of the debt comes to the debtor if he does not see a need for Certification, and he did not ask him to give mortgages in travel or in urbanization.The debt is the creditor if the creditor comes to him if they are given a more precious thickness of the values ​​of the debt in it, and the majority is that the betting will be the most valuable of the values ​​of the values For its sake, every aspect of a trust is commanded to perform his safety, so the debt of the debt is safe with the payment of the debt without a lengthy or the wounds, and the performance of the debt, and the performance of the ritual The value of the value on the debt is to return the mortgages and not be unjust to the two parents; Because the mortgages are more than it, and it is not shorted from the mortgages.The safety is used in two meanings: the meaning of the adjective in which the trustworthy is described, and the meaning of the secure thing.It is taken from this interpretation of the heroes of the mortal: that the thing becomes a king of the king of the Lord of the religion, if the debt is not pushed at the time of the sake of God Al -Rahman, “The locking of the mortgages was one of the people of the people of the ignorance.To say no dealing with the other: there is no need for us to testify and we believe that some of us will be safe, and that is so that the intention is not to be broken by the intent The suspicion of accusing one of the other two years.(P-125) He added to warn his saying: Let God fear His Lord and remember the name of Majesty in it with the place of the exploitation of his saying: And to his Lord: The guilt of the poisonous and the darkening of the release.And his saying: The one who believed in it, J, is the period in the last (who) and after that, two of them are the same as the prayer, and it is the thunderbolt of the abuse, and the second, and the second, and the second.So the public read it to break it with a hooping, after the fracture of the splendor; Because the thunder of the connection fell in the domain, so the ghost remained on its silence; As the one who calls for the second time is a period of time, it is the first toxicity.There is no reason for the present.And he read it as a spray from Nafaa, Abu Amr, and Abu Jaafar: It was considered that the original gossip had turned or after the thunderbolt of the righteous abuse; Because the one has annexed the thunder of the connection, embarrassing the movement of the expulsion, when the construction of the unknown, so when the thundering of the command was deleted in the way The second and after the break of the one who was “walked the wow, Ja.In this reader, two hearts.Abu Bakr read it from Asim: This disagreement is back to the performance of performance, so there is no violation in it to draw the journalist.* * * And do not conceal the testimony and whoever assigns it, for it is the sinner of his heart and God What do you do.A second way for the testimony that testimonies are collected in all the conditions; He commanded that the witness write with justice, and then forbids abstaining from the writing between the two weighing, and he followed that by forbidding it, so that it is the same, so it is forbidden, so that it is the same.Its generalization is in the home of discounting to the rulings of testimony in the debt.(P-126) And know that his saying is up to the Almighty: Do not conceal the testimony, and that the prohibition is required to benefit the repetition when the scholars of the origins of the origins, that is, the righteousness of the The actions of his deeds, and if not for the repetition of the righteousness, it would not have been achieved, and that the renovation that the forbidden is required, the righteousness of it is the one who is the one who is the one To do the one who is from him, then it was a right to those who carry a testimony in a right that he would not assemble him at the time of his advertisement: that he will be informed of him, or he will be informed of him Whenever the preacher appears to be shrouded with it, or before that if the witness fears, what is in his knowledge is faded with a unseen or a human being, or the arms of what is not The witness is that he is preserved for the truth that is in his knowledge, on the enemy of his energy and his duplication.And if you knew that God has proposed that his intention is to reside the testimony on its face by saying: and he resides for the testimony [Al -Baqarah: 282] and that he was incite to He was asked to say: The testimony does not refuse if they are called [Al -Baqarah: 282], so he knew from all of that to be complete with the appearance of testimony to show the truth, and he will support this The saying of the Prophet ﷺ “Do I not tell you the best of the testimony, who comes with his testimony before he asks her.This is the face of the interpretation of the verse that appears in which the effect and the view appears, but it was narrated in the correctness of Abu Hurairah: that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “The best of my mother is the good Then those who followed them - he said second, and the father of Harra doubted the third - and then they succeeded people who testify before they are martyred.It is a marketer, the argument of those who described them that they are witnessing before they are martyred, and that they were given to them for the sake of that adjective, and the scholars have fallen asleep in the authority of the authority, he said: On his appearance, whoever is witnessed before the testimony is required of him, and the gathering of his disagreement, and that this is not urgency, and they made what is in the hadith on whether he witnessed, if he witnessed Al -Saheeh, “The best of witnesses who come to his testimony before he asks them” and say: A Muslim narrated from Amran bin Husayn that the Messenger of God said: Those who release them - he said two or three times - and then they will be a people who testify and do not martyred "the hadith.(P-127) It is clear that what was narrated by Abu Hurai One, both of them heard it, and their phrases differed in his story, so that Amr ibn Husayn was shown, shown, and he said: To be martyred, “without martyrdom, that is, without martyrdom, a martyr, that is, to carry a martyr, that is, they testify what they do not know, With his saying: And carry what is in the hadith - that is, the hadith of Abu Hurairah - on whether he witnessed a liar.This is a way for the collection between the two narrators, and it returns to the bearing of the camel on the clear.Al -Nawawi said: Some scholars interpret it that the testimony of the testimony was asked before the testimony is asked in the testimony of the rights of people with the difference of what is in the right of God.Al -Nawawi said: This group is the view of our companions, and this is a way that returns to the actions of each of the two hadiths in a chapter, with the interpretation of each of the two hadiths, for the two of the hadiths, One of them is canceled.I said: The Shafi’iyyah built it with the return of the testimony that the witness performs before he asked her.Al -Ghazali mentioned it in the permissible, and who was transmitted by Ibn Marzouk in the explanation of a disagreement on the goodness of the permissible, “the custody of the testimony of the mission before the predecessor, and it is not accepted.And before the guidance and Juda As for the money, their words were disappeared.The one who went to Ayad and Ibn Marzouk is that the performance of the witness is his testimony before he asked her an acceptance of the hadith of Al -Muwati: He asks her, “Al -Baji quoted Malik: The meaning of the hadith is that it is a witness to a man who does not know about it, so he tells it and leads it to it, and it will be done for it.He mentioned it in the slow and did not remove it with what it requires that he does not work on him, and Al -Baji followed Ibn Marzouk in his explanation of the disagreement of the mind, and he does not know that he does not He violates him, and who was gone to the son of the Hajib, and a successor and explained their disagreement: that the performance of the testimony before the witness is required to perform it, and it is forbidden from the acceptance of the one who said: It begins with it without a request, as it is embraced by the right of the Adami, and he said a caliph - a person who is on the contrary of the acceptance of the testimony -: “Or he raised before the ritual (P-128), as well as Ibn Rashid Al-Qafsi in his book (Al-Fouaq in Judgments and Truths), and the Nawawi attributed it in his explanation on the right of a Muslim who is a Muslim, who is the one who is a Muslim, who is the one who is a Muslim, who is the one who is a Muslim, who is the one who is a Muslim, and he is the one who is a Muslim, and he is the one who is a Muslim, and he The conversation of the hadith of Abu Hurairah, and perhaps he took the proportions of that for the king of the words of Ibn Al -Hajib Al -Mudaqid.Ibn Marzouq claimed that Ibn Al -Hajib followed Ibn Shas, when he said: If he turns it with it without a request, he was not accepted.And that Ibn Shas took him from the words of Al -Ghazali, he said: And the provisions of the Mudhhab are required that if he raised them before the request, then he did not praise it, but it is not.His action is a delegate, so no less than that he does not respond, and he is induced by the words of Al -Baji in the explanation of a hadith: “The best of the testimony who comes to his testimony before he asks.” They have been walked in the matter On the accusation of cursing on his testimony and that it is a suspicion.And his saying: Whoever holds it, it is the sinner of his heart is a increase in warning, and the sin: sins and immorality.And the heart is a name for awareness and the psychological interactions and intentions, and the sin is supported to the heart, but the richness is that the heart - that is, the movements of the mind - For the martyrdom of the martyrdom is a heart of disobedience, and the same is the saying of the Almighty: they were free to the eyes of the people [Al -A'raf: 116], but they were sacrificed by the people.And the east saying: ؎ So, then do what you live if you dispersed and submit if the people appoint a separation because the difference arises from the vision of the horrors.And his saying: And God is what you do to be tied, as a result of the reward for the same as the manufacturer; Because the Qadir does not turn between him and between the disagreement except for ignorance, then if it is a science, he established the seat of the penalty.
