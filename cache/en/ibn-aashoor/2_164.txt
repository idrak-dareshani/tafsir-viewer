The Quranic researcher is that in the creation of the heavens, the earth, and the disturbance of the night, the day, and the ark that runs in the sea, with what the people benefit, and what God has descended from the sky of water, then the earth is with it.From every bear and the script of the winds and the clouds between the sky and the earth, the verses of the people who are reasonable.The satellite of this verse is a successor, the satellite of the argument from the preacher, so God Almighty has declared that God is a single God, and there is no God, and it is not the same It is received by the denial of a lot of people, as well as the establishment of the pilgrimage to those who are not convinced, and this clear indicative is clear, which does not seek the look of the view.So here is for the extermination of the news of the news of the attention to it, and it is necessary that they have descended a house of those who deny that there are verses in that of them.On what is indicated by these verses.And it is not here with a muezzin with an exhaustion for the sentence before it, because the condition of that is to be the one who is the sentence that is after the righteousness of the righteousness Before her, the satellite will be for the fulfillment of kindness, and then, and the fall of the (P-77).We have said in it when he said, "Take a lump, for Egypt, for you have what you asked [Al -Baqarah: 61].What is meant by his verse is the proof of the evidence of God Almighty and his two aspects, and for that, it was mentioned that the remembrance of al -Haddani was mentioned, because if it was proven by the one who was proven Wooding with the harm.The verse is valid for the response to the disbelievers of the villages of their ears, their partners, and the partners who are intended, and God has decided in this way of the verse The creatures are with its clarity, they are covered by the secrets of the people, so that every loyalty of the minds is in the capacity And their sciences.And the creation is here in the sense of the source and the choice of here because it is a gathering of everything in which there is a cross of the skies The formation of the heavens, the earth, and the universal system between them, as every one of them or in it is a verse and a lesson, as well The form of the sun system, which is the system that is set in the lands of the earth with the cries of the path that is expressed by the heavens.And the heavens are the collection of a sky and the sky, if it is released, so it is intended by the raised atmosphere, then it is clear that it appears as if it is a dome of the dome, and it is the dome of the greatness of the Al -Kawakib, and that is what is meant in the face of his saying, and we have decorated the worldly sky with the wise man [King: 5] We decorated the worldly sky with the adornment of the curtains: [6] And water from the sky [Al -Baqarah: 22].And if it is collected, then what is meant by great boundaries with a special system, such as the land, which is the great, well -known cars, which are known after the one who will be known, and the one who will know, The sheikh, the sun, the cheerful, the sacrifice, and the Annus, and the Nabitan.Perhaps it is the seven heavens and the great throne, and this secret is in the collection of the heavens here and the individuals of the earth because the land is one of the one and one of them is one of the verses, so it is the same Surround it.The meaning is that in the creation of the group of the heavens with the earth verses, then the creation was unique and the earth was given to the heavens, so that the added is the addition of them.And the verse in this creation of people who understand a great verse for those who know the secrets of this system and the barriers of (P-78) the attractive that God has called in God The cars on a face that is not condemned by a mixture or a burning, not the sun, and it is not possible for you to realize the moon, nor the night, the righteousness She grabs her in this way, Al -Fakher said: Omar ibn al -Hasam was reading the book of al -Mujsi on the age of al -Abhir So Al -Abhiri said, I explain his saying, “Do they not look at the sky, and they were on the authority of how it is its children [Q: 6].Whoever was more tense in the seas of the creatures was more knowledgeable in the glory of God, the Almighty, and his greatness.I said: And from the obedience of this creation that God has made it a promise that extends to each other with what every person needs, so it does not decrease from the extend We are short, and so we find the stretching items, so the sea extends the atmosphere with the humid A river and valley.It is a verse for those who were in the mind without his arranged all, so he realized from the group of this creation as a budget scene in the solar and its sins, and the appearance of the dawn.As for the advertisement, in its creatures, the exiles of it, such as the stars, the constants, the martyrs, the land, the seas, the flowers, and the animal, so that it is from that Community.And the saying of the night and the day is a reminder of a great verse that does not hide from one of the mind From the benefits of people and the injustice of the benefits to them to collect their silence and return their powers, which are done by work.In this, there is a verse for the concern of the minds, as they know the reasons for the disagreement of the night and the day on the ground, and that it is one of the effects of the lights of the earth around the sun in every day.The verse is in their choice, and that requires that each of them is a sign.And the difference is a disagreement of the successor, which is that something is compensated for something other that he succeeds in its place and the successor by breaking the successor, Zahir said: Negative.(P-79) The difference was added to each of the night and the day because each one of them is behind the other, so you will get from it, and it is a good one who is a friend of the other.One of them is to turn the benefit as harm, say, I saw that God made you the night to the day of the Day of Resurrection, whoever is the God of God, who will come to you, do not hear.May God bless you with the day of the Day of Resurrection.The conclusion has another meaning that is also intended, and it is their recession in length and shortness.The place of the land is the length of the country and its symptoms as it is determined in the science of the body, and this is also one of the places of the lesson because it is the effects of the obedient industrial in the form of the earth Near and distant.In the choice of expressing the creation, there is a secret of the sake of the sake of the phrase, so that the phrase is good for the two lessons.The night is a name for the presentation of the darkness and the blackness that prestige is a half of the land of the land that is unavoidable for the sun, so if the veil of the sun is not The half of the landsmarks are due to the curtain correspondence.The original that only the sun is still and the light is reduced from the time of the sunset of the sun from the consequences of the horizon, the time of the time The redness, then the righteous, until the darkening of the time of dinner, when the sun is closed, from the horizons that the absence started from, and the word is the one who is close to the sham.The other is more than its beams, from the time of the dawn to the travel to the parts to the sacrifice, where the light of the sun is directed towards the half of the sun.And that light is the name of the night, and it is the complete light that is overwhelmed by the surface of the land, and if it may enlighten the surface of the moon in the moon in the way Completely, and the light of some of the stars is a weak eclipse that is almost not considered.This is what is meant by the contradiction of the night and the day, that is, their punishment, and the successor of one of them, and from the rhetoric of the knowledge of the Qur’an, that this is called a disagreement of the name The jewel is because it is something other than (P-80).The disagreement of the ignorant of the ignorant nations is that the night is a good body, as the Egyptians portrayed it by some of the people, and as he said: The commander of the one said: He stretched his crucifixion ∗∗∗ and added a miracle and a fullness of all, and he said in the surah of sun and day if they are gone and the night if he cheats it [the sun: 3].And his saying and the ark is a kindness on creation and disagreement, so it is a work for any: and in the ark, and described it as the one who runs the connection to the path of kindness, that is, the kindness of the kind And the land in its place is a sign of where it is running in the sea, and in its place as a blessing from where it is running with what the people benefit, so it is running in the sea, then it is the same.The verse of the creation of the sea in which the ark is in which a great and great creation was as it was a well -off water for the most landsmith and the way it is in the creation and what is in the mother of the mother And the Kimyawi drugs to be unaware, but by the opposite, it will come out for the air with the parts of the life of the earth, and the second is the one who is the water of the water, and the second is the water It is that the walk is excluded from it, so the travel of the travel is a verse of God, the Humans for the Human to the Humanity of the Honor, for this miracle, the sacrifice of the one who is good As he walks on the ground, and the ark is made from the feet of the peculiarities of human beings, may God be upon him, may God bless him be upon him, peace be upon him.Duraiya, which is a wind that is blowing in the morning to a side and in the evening to a side in the soups that arises from the trauma of the sun of the sun in the seller of the day, which is in the righteousness, so that the air is not in the righteous.The sea side to succeed that is the wild air, which is ascending, and the wind spoke of prosperity from the sea side, and the opposite of that is followed by the time of the ritual To the sea, and this wind is intended by the fishermen and the merchants, and it is more systematic in the places of it in other places.And the ark was harnessed by a smooth wind as it is blowing to one side in the most famous of the year and to its opposite in the last months that happens from the direction of the righteousness The location between the path of the Sultan and the orbit of the seriousness from the ground of the land when the sun was transferred from the line of the level to the side of the path of the Sultan and the side of the path The wind is two times in the Sunnah, and it is many in the rituals of Yemen, Hadmat and the Handy Sea, and the commercial wind is called.(P-81) As for her, it is a blessing, because in the gesture, it is a benefit for merchants, the exercise, the conquest, and otherwise, and for that he said what the people benefit from the intention of the intention.And the ark is here a collection, not a case, because the lesson is in its many, and it is its uniqueness throughout the time, so it is broken in it That the origin of his individuality has two sins as a neck and a break on a king like an Arab, a legend, and a lion, and the individual is reduced by the one who is in the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes The fulfillment of the one who is the eye of the eye was intended to be reduced to what the satisfaction has shown, so it was equal in the unique and the collection, and the individual was said to open the fulfillment of the loyalty And the mother was said, a lion, a lion, a wood, a wood, then a dwelling, dwarfed, diluted, and the eloquence recovery in the individual and the collection is the opposite of the fulfillment and the silence of the lame said [Hood: 37] And the scarcity of the ark [poets: 119] and he said, and the ark that runs in the sea and said, and the king is running in the sea with his command [Hajj: 65] even if you are in the astronomy: His uniqueness, the exalted, and the scarcity, said [poets: 119], and it is permissible to give it to his interpretation in the sense of the travel.[Hood: 42] All of that after his saying and the ark is made [Hood: 38].As if this is the one who was intended by the son of the Hajib, when he kept the ark from what was feminine with a time or a thousand, so he said in his poem: ؎ And the ark is in the Qur’an, and it is in the Qur’an while it is in the Qur’an while it is With his feminine accumulation, and if it is a manner, it was said that it is permissible in his individuality, then he only the oppression of the blame with the opposite of the fulfillment, and the one who says it, and the saying of it, Al -Kawashi: It is also the light of the mother for the individual and the collection, and it is a meteor, as it was not stated on the people of the language, and there is no reason for it, as if he said it with a measure of the sake.In the dignity of God, the exalted of the ark in the sea in the sea is an indicative of the ritual ride of the sea from the same as a lane, such as its ride to the invasion, the pilgrimage, the merchant, and the merchant, and the merchant, and the merchant, And the people of Al -Sahah followed him the hadith of the mother of a forbidden daughter in the chapter of the desire to be absent in the second jihad of the one who is from the one who is from Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, he said: Cables entering the mother of a forbidden mother, and she was hurting him, and she was under the servants of the son of the silence, and he entered the Messenger of God, so he slept, and he slept.So I said what is laughing at you.Hadith.(P-82) And in the hadith of Abu Hurairah, “A man came to the Messenger of God ﷺ He said that we are riding the sea and carrying with us a few of the water.It was written to Amr ibn al -Aas that the Muslims do not carry the Muslims in the sea, which is based on the whims and the leaving of alienation, and I have calculated it.Muslims in their invasions, because the travel may delay and reach it if the winds that are running are not helpless The ship is crafted, and because the ride of the many number in the ships of that era is the thought of the fall of the places, and because the number of Muslims is a few days So his abundance does not devote himself to the danger, so that is in the view of the public reconciliation in specific conditions, so it is not invoked in special rulings for people.And when Omar died, the Muawiyah of Uthaman was permissible, so he was authorized to him in his ride, so he installed him to the conquest of Qabr The interpretation of the vision of the Prophet ﷺ in the hadith of the mother of a forbidden, and it was said that Omar ibn Abd al -Aziz, when I have the disagreement, forbade his ride and then the ritual of the people.The freedom of the travel of women in the sea of ​​pilgrimage and jihad, Ibn Abd al -Barr said: The hadith of the mother of a forbidden mother who responds to this narration, but it is his first companions.For the fear of their access to the men of men to the hardship of the bound by that, his companions summarized him with the sins of the people of Hijaz because of their smallness and narrow The way is from the city to a place of righteousness, easy, and the elderly travel, such as the shedding of the people of Basra, in which the custody can be in which it is possible Women have a mill.And what God has descended from the sky from the water that is given to the names before it, the name of a connected name is brought to, so that the compassion of a link is coming, so the sentence is left.The first prayer, which is the descending of God from the heaven, is reminded of the lesson, because in the prayer, it is not necessary for the state that is not in the face of the word of the rain and the abundance, and the abundance, and the abundance I find the reasons for the water of the water with the formation of things when this world created a judged system.The heaven is the atmosphere and the air surrounding the earth as it is presented as a nose, and it is the one who sees all the smiles.(P-83) And the lesson is that the water that water the land is to be seized from it, so that the water will be removed from it against it, which is the sky, a wondrous lesson.And in the verse is a scientific lesson for those who come from the people of the medical science, and that is that making water descending from the sky indicates that the scent of water becomes water in the water of the air.The classical class, and this class, expresses a tanner when the changer of the sun is reduced, and perhaps in some of the rituals, the high and the most important The Zahir is in the row of the atmosphere, so it will have a trace in the formation of coldness at the top of the atmosphere.With a narrated hadith, which is: “The rain descends from a sea under the throne” that is, that the water of the water is formed, and it will reach the wound to the wandering, until it is from the time of it.If the land is pursued, it will be formed Among its duplicates, the water, and he said, and it was revealed from the sky from the mountains in it from [Al -Nur: 43], and perhaps the mountains of the moon of the moon, and it has been established in the form that the day of the moon is a fifth.Let him be like that, and he will get a great change in the severity of the freedom to the intensity of the cold, so if it is the period of the intensity of the cold, it is the period The land is the element of cold.And his saying, “The earth is given to him, he is given to the prayer by the fulfillment of the sake of the life of the earth.Life was launched on the movement of the growing forces from the earth, which is the power of plants, because life is a right to appear the growing powers in the animals, so the land is seen.And if we made life a truth in the appearance of the forces of growth and made the plant described the life of life and with the death, then he said it, so the earth is a reward for the sake The land is the plant.And in the collection between the sky and the earth and between the lives and the death of two.And he said and broadcast in it from every bear, either on the authority of it, so it is a second link and the advertisement of what was composed before it on the prayer is a third prayer, or the one who is over.A second given to the prayer, and whatever it is a sign of independent, then if you made it a kindness on the prayer, then it is in his saying from every bear in the case, which is in the case.Permanent, and if you made it a kind of kindness on the prayer, which is “revived” from (P-84) in his saying from every white tuberculosis, which is a difference in it One of the types of animals in the sense is that every type of animal is a lot of many of its types, so the denial is in a bear for the dignity of any of the most of all kinds Without another.And the broadcast in the original, the publication of what was hidden, and the broadcast of the complaint and the broadcast of the secret; That is, it appears.The Arabism said: I have been subjected to you, and I feared you, and in the hadith of the mother of a cultivation, “The sixth said, and the palm is not brought to the palm to know the broadcast” He married him to spread it to him, so the search was represented by the inner of the palm to take the hideout, and then he used a metaphor in the spread of the thing, as it was in the time It was also used in the divorce of the spread, Al -Hammasi said: ؎ And I do not prepare me for the like, and in the land, there is a courageous, and the sterilizer, and the shedding of the animals is on the face He was the creation of the types of animals on the ground, and he expressed it by broadcasting to the imagination of that wondrous creation that is the most And on the face of kindness and broadcast on the sake of the animals, then it was spread in the patent, after it was a crouching core and the spread of its wretchedness in the birth, and all of it, and it is a matter With his saying: The sales of the stars was stolen and their injury ∗∗∗ and the accuracy of the rituals of their wakes and their trustees ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ It is permissible from the house of a fold and the savage of the meaning, because its saying is the Almighty and what God has revealed from the sky of water, or it is permissible from the first house, and he said: His saying: Do the righteousness of Al -Ayahqan, and the best and the most heavy in the sense of life, and his saying and broadcast in it from every bear, and it is permissible from his saying:.The house is with his being, a best way to restrict him to antelope and cattle.The bear did not bear on the face of the earth, and the word of every word has been ears that the meant is all kinds, so it was exempted to be intended from the tab His saying was completed, so the earth was gathered after its death and transmitted in it every bear.In the rest of the verse, a precedent and right from the scientific references that are due to the knowledge of the form, the science of the patriarch, and the science of the generous and the science of the jaws.(P-85) And his saying and the script of the winds is a composition on the entry of “in”, which is one of the verses and the greatness of the Creator and the greatness Were it not for the wise man who was the most drained of the secrets of the nations, when the wind did not come or did not rest The winding of the wind is the position of a blessing, which is that its grapes may need the people of the position to the depletion of the free or the vilification And the like, or for the virginity of the benefits like the bird.And the people of Mecca may need to disagree with its soil to come with a cold wind after a hot wind or a moisturizing wind after a soft wind, or to go to the face The people of travel from travel or from the hunter, for all this is the place And the position of a blessing, and that is because the wind is to be taught that God surrounded the land of the land with an air that created it with it, with it, he breathed into the time, and it is the one who is the same, and it is the same, and it is the one who is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same.It is connected to its flatness and occupies from the surface of its surface, a reaction that does not live the animal if it was escalated to the top, and God has created it as the one who is a source of the two gases, and the two of the two gazans And there is another part that is an exhibiting in which it is a side of the water that is escalated by it from the sacrifice of the seas and the wetness of the earth with the rays of the sun, and this steam is a gas, and this steam is no gas The air is subject to the free and the righteousness in the cause of a hot or cold, and its free comes from the sun of the sun and from the righteousness It comes From the slight of the sun and from the frigidity of the arrogance from the Zerir, which is intended with the atmosphere of the atmosphere as it was presented.And when you were free from its rituals, the parts of the things would be extended, so that the stretching is overwhelmed, as it is decided in the generous, and the righteousness is in the opposite.Like the Sahmers and air on a cold side, such as the dancer, a fiercest fall between the two air in the density, so the light was stuck, and it is the hot and the thickness of the thick to the lower A vacuum in which the thick is left as a request for the budget, then a movement that is called a wind is called, so if the movement is light for the closeness The movement is a tissue, and if the movement is intended and the lobby is fractured.(P-86) The wind is the sweetener of its molecule, the tissue, the sacrifice, and the risk of its types.And from the windows of the winds of the winds, to be the formation of the clouds and its transmission from the position to the position and the purification of the air, which is replaced by it from the parts, and the one who is replaced by the germs, The two things are the place of lessons and grace for the people of science.He may choose to express the expression of the expression here without the grace of the discipline or the difference because it is the memorial who is the one who is in the same way, what is in the case of the one who is in the case of the matter, Because the script is an effective from the way of the exaggeration, and you have learned that the origin of the wind is the way of some air to a place, and it is not the same as it is that it was the same.It is appreciated: the wilderness of God is the high wind, and made the scrutiny to the wind with that the wind was formed by that scrub, so it is from the release of the name on the one who has the same as the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has the same as the one who has the same The attribution of them curses them [Al -Baqarah: 159] and it is a beating of the first metaphor, and that you make the scrutiny in the sense of alienation, that is, the wind from one side to the side of the part Scientific miracle is the choice of the export without changing because it is lighter.And the winds were here because the departure requires the number because it is whenever it changes its talent, so it has become a wind that was not the same, and he read the rituals of the ritual.The wind is the wind of the will on the will of the gender, and the benefit of the general benefit from the name of the gender, whether it was a paradise or a group, and it was said that the wind is not.Its resignation is in the wind of good and that the wind with an individuality is frequently seized in the wind of evil, and they are used in that with what he narrated from the Prophet ﷺ " Make it a wind, not a wind, "and it is a separation of a calamity, otherwise it will be changed by the individuals in the position of the group, and the reflection in a many readers of the readers.And the hadith was not valid, and the saying of separation is the best of what is known to it that the beneficial wind for people comes to light and disrupts its rituals Do not get harmful to them, and with administering the gaps of the gaps for their grapes, they gathered, and the modern wind is not left for people, so there is a pleasure, so he will make this It is taken from the words of Qarbi.And the winds are a crow and the wind with a weighing action by breaking the fulfillment and its eyes, or it was flipped for the sake of breaking with the sake of their saying in the gathering, and the one who says: The waws are in it, in which it is in the paradoxes in the individual, because of the fraction, as they said a blood, a domain, a trick, a trick, and they are from the wai.(P-87) Its saying and the clouds are the most kind of winds and the winds of the winds, or the winds, and the estimation will be: and the scandal of the clouds of the laughter, that is, to be transferred to the Placement.It is a lesson and a minor.And it is used from a position to the position of its from the authority and its universe between the sky and the earth, because the rain descends from it on the ground from the ritual of the water, and the water is in the water If it was on the ground, the people would be cracked, then this is what it appears to every one, and in that also a lesson and a violation of the people of knowledge, then you will be forced It is formed from the righteousness of the seas and the wetness of the earth that the sun is shaken, and therefore the air is not removed from the water of the water as we presented it, except that the water of the water is gone If he broke up a righteous, heavily and thickened, then he became fog, denied, or clouds, but rather that the parts of the vapor are gathered, and they will decrease the power Its meeting is rainy, and to be the steam steam to the atmosphere, the most vapor of the sea; Because the sea is more surfaces of the land, the clouds were more than the form of the sailor, and they thought that all of the rain is the water of the sea The spices of the sea, so the water is gone from it, then it comes down to a rain.Abu Dhiab Al -Hudhali said: “The mother of Amr, every last one, will be the end of the night.We have a fence and Al -Badi Al -Asrallabi said: “I guide your holy skyr It is upon him because it is from his hundred, and if the winds would mimic of it from a position to a position, the rain would only be descended in the seas.And the position of the place in this in its formation until it carries the water to revive the earth, and in its mockery to take it, and in its place between the heavens and the earth, then it is the name The land is until the air is in the air, so the clouds are less than the clouds, and water will be descended if it does not remain in the air.And the words of the violics of a people They are reasonable, that is, the evidence, and the words may be presented to the verse and verses, (P-88), and the verses were collected, because in all the creation of the heavens and the earth and what was composed of verses.فَإنْ أُرِيدَ الِاسْتِدْلالُ بِها عَلى وُجُودِ اللَّهِ تَعالى فَقَطْ كانَتْ دَلائِلَ واضِحَةً وكانَ رَدًّا عَلى الدَّهْرِيِّينَ مِنَ العَرَبِ وكانَ ذِكْرُهم بَعْدَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وماتُوا وهم كُفّارٌ [البقرة: 161] The one who is intended for the partners is a repair of the people of the bee in the Arabs, and its saying will be after that and from the people who take from the one without God: [165] The participants, and this direction is referring to the scholar of the world on the law, which is a famous indication in the books of speech, and if I want the one who is the same The transgression of the ritual of its existence, which is the phenomenon of its saying to the people who are reasonable because the domesticated with its significant signs and its proverbs are on the authority of the goodness With the disagreement of the pilgrimage to it on the face of al -Haddaniya, and because it is mentioned after his saying and your God is one God, there is no god but He [Al -Baqarah: 163], and because there is no The eternal disruptions.And the sufficiency of this indication in the response to the participants from where they did not call for idols as much as creation as he pointed to him, as he said to him Do you not remember [Al -Nahl: 17], and if I want to refer to these effects of God, God is on the nations that prove to be the like in the same way The Morsi of the Persians and the Junction of the Lean.So, the significance of this verses on the antibiotics is that this is the innocent system in the unknown things, and that mobilization in its formation, its interaction, its release, and its release, and its rejoicing, An indication that it has a wise, described as the knowledge of knowledge, capacity, wisdom, and adjectives that are required by the guidance, and there is no crime that the God of God will be Because the partners are known that the consequences of creation and the world of the world of the act of God Almighty, as they did not invite their partnerships the creation and for that, he said: Do you not remember [Al -Nahl: 17], and remember in the surah of the mill, who is exalted with some of what is here that there is no god with God, so what is reminded of the repetition of the right Their partnership, and the way of scientific reference is the prohibited bet in the knowledge God spoils [Al -Anbiya: 22] in Surah Al -Anbiya.And the people: The group is one of the men and is called the man of the man, as Amr ibn Mu’adi said: And he mentioned the memory of “people who are reasonable” without being said to those who are reasonable or for the sane people because the conduct of the description is on There are no people, and it is noteworthy that this description is a prostration in them, and among the status of their people, then the tribes and the nations have a characteristic of them, and they are distinguished by what they have.But they are people who separate [repentance: 56] and this has been repeated in many places Exposing that those who did not benefit from the verses of that, their minds are not established, nor are they compatriots for them, and this has been repeated in Surah Yunus.
