The researcher, the divorced women, are three readers, and it is not permissible for them to give them what God has created in their wombs, if he believes in the best of God In their response, if they want to give a compassion on the sentence before it, for the adversity His saying did not provide the divorce two times [Al -Baqarah: 229] on his saying and divorced women who are lining, because this verse came in harmony, and he is a shadow on the authority Usually the Qur’an in the creativity of the rulings, and its meeting, with easy, easy -to -be of the soul, and does not come to the image of the learning and the lesson.And our words will come to divorce with the words of the height of the divorce two times [Al -Baqarah: 229].And the sentence and divorcees of the experience that is intended for the matter.Report and obtaining.It is the face, which was chosen by the Tafawazani in his saying, the highest of the right of the word of torment, so that you will save those in the fire [Al -Zumar: 19] that it will be in the way The construction, due to the relationship of the matter between the matter, for example, as it is here, and between the compliance, until the commander appreciates an actor and is informed of it.It is permissible to make it a metaphor, as it was chosen by the Zamakhiri in this verse, when he said: As if they are the same as the matter of the confusion, then it is the one who tells it, so it is to tell it.They said in the supplication: God has mercy on him, a trust.Al-Tafazani said: P-389) liken it to be the one who is required to fall into what is achieved in the past as in the saying of the people: may God have mercy on him, or in the case, or in the case, or in the case, or in This verse.I said: And it was presented in his saying, so there is no puff, no veil, nor a new pilgrimage [Al -Baqarah: 197], and that he released the richness of the same.And the definition of the divorcees of the purpose of the sitting.It is beneficial to the darkening, as it is not reconciled here.It is general in the divorcees of the readers of the readers of his saying, and they relax with themselves three readers, as this is not imagined in others.The verse is general in the divorcees of the readers, and this is not with a special edition in this, with a communication or a separation, and no one is intended for the sake, but it is in general, but it is in general, but it is in general, but it is in general, but it is in general, but it is in general, but it is in general, but it is in the general, but it is in general.The estimated is the significant significance.The verse is general in the divorcees of the readers.It is specialized in freedoms without slaves, so the slave was brought out, with what was proven in the Sunnah: “The number of the nation is two hugs.It is an entirety of the divorce of the divorcees of the readers, and there is no relationship with them other than the divorcees, such as the divorced divorces He is one of the readers of readers, and they are the women who did not reach the age of menstruation, and the women from the menstruation, and the mockery, and their ruling has been shown in the surah.However, it comes out of its divorced mummies before the construction of the readers of the readers, for they are specialized from this general, with his saying, O, O, those who believe, if you are safe.You divorced them before they touched them, so what you have to do with them is a number that you are accustomed to [Al -Ahzab: 49], so it is in a general one that is devoted to a summary.Money and Al -Shafi’iya said: It is a year for the four items, with separate specialties, and in which there is a view of the divorce before the construction.It is in the year in general I want the peculiarities with a cocoon, that is, with the cores of the connotation of the constant rulings of these items.Rather, they resorted to that because they see the disclosure separated by people, and the condition of the copy is the descending of the human being, and the abuse of the one is stated in the ritual The divorcees.The truth is that the pretext of the unprecedented disclosure is a dirty origin, originally, it is not new.Because the publication of the public is its roses out of it with some of the individuals with an authenticity.To show its heroes, nor the special copy of the year, for its predecessor, and the transcription is not preceded; And after, they did not fall into general, so specialization is not a copy.(P-390) and they are pressed with themselves, that is, they will meet and wait for the mourning of three readers, and increase their soul Urgent, throwing themselves to marry, so they are commanded to lie with themselves, that is, they will be silent and not sent to them.He said in the scouts: In the remembrance of the same, they will be tired of them on the table and the increase of resurrection; Because there is what he will stop from it, and they can carry them on the authority of them.Some of the grammarians claimed: that with themselves is a certainty to add the divorced divorce, and that the B is increased, and from you he said with the increase of the B in the sure to be sure.It was mentioned by the owner of the singer, and his response, on the authority of Al -Lakhd, that: the right to confirm the connected destiny, to be after the remembrance of the ritual, or by the one who said: Suffice the rhythm of the run; And from the meaning of the meaning, that confirmation is not necessary for me; As the mind of the smile does not go to the fact that the commander is not divorced who is the beginning, which is included in his news.Three readings were affected by the activity of the verb in it; Because the words are added to additional; That is, the period of three readers, when the added is the additive to which it is added to the Arabs.And the reciter is the collection of a reciter - with the opening of the endowment and its annexation, and it is a sharing of the menstruation and the purification.Abu Ubaida said: It is a place for the resignation from the purification To menstruation, or from menstruation to purification, then if it is released on purification or on the menstruation, it was a launch on one of its two parties.And the ritual followed.Perhaps they wanted that face to release him.And I think that the most famous of the readers, when the Arabs, is the purification, and that was mentioned in the hadith of Omar, that his son is the servant of God, when he divorced his life in the menstruation, that.His question is only for the sake of that they were only released in the event of purification, so that the purification in which the divorce was placed in the principle The one is the one who is the saying of all jurisprudence, but the son of Shihab, so he said: The purification in which the divorce is placed.And the scholars differed in the intention of the readers, in this verse, which is upon him the jurisprudence of the city, and the people of the effect of the effect, that the reciter is the purification.This is the saying of Aisha, Zayd ibn Thabat, Ibn Omar, and a group of companions, from the jurisprudence of the city, Malik, and Al -Shafi’i, in the clarification of his words.What is meant by the pure purification is between Damin.Ali, Umar, Ibn Masoud, Abu Hanifa, Al -Tuiri and Ibn Abi Lali, and Group: He is the menstruation.And on the authority of Al-Shafi’i, in one of his saying, that the purification is transmitted from it to the menstruation, (P-391), and it is a agreement for what the father of Ubaidah was pleased with, and it is not a man.The reciter: the purification, so there is no face of its enemy.And the reference of the look at me, in this, to the gathering between the intense of the hurry from the number.This is that the enemy is intended from the release of the divorced mercy, from the bearing of the divorced, and waiting for the husband, perhaps he may return.The righteousness of the womb is obtained with one or one purification, and what has been increased in the period in the period waiting for the return.The single menstruation has been made a brand on the righteousness of the mercy, in the nation’s desirability in the resignation of the king, and in the Sabaya, and in other words, it is different in some of it, so that it is between it.On one menstruation, it is not to achieve the number of pregnancy, but that in that period in the divorce, it is up to the divorce, and it is hard on the divorced, so it is the same The right of the divorced to wait for it after the first time and its end, and the purification after it.Those who made the readers a backwardness took into account the relief from the woman, with the arrival of the gum to the husband, and they were used with the impact.And those who made the readers ’urgency, they increased the divorced woman.Because the divorce is only in the purification of the whole, as it was mentioned in the hadith of Omar ibn al -Khattab in al -Saheih, and they agreed that the purification that took place in the divorce is in the ritual Reading.And read the form of the collection of many, it is used in the three, and it is a few expanding, on their habits in the crowd that it is tied, so it was dotted in The lighter verse is with the security of the dress, with the grace of the enemy.And with the end of the three readings, the period of the enemy will expire, and the absolute divorce is shown from its parties, and that is when the third purification is passed and the one who enters the urbanization in Jamour: If you see the first point of the third time, it is removed from the enemy, then you will be achieved that it is blood.And from the strangers of the recipient of the recitation of the reciter.The recitation of the name of the nominal name in its saying is the highest readers of the readers.Feminine, three readers said, Ibn al -Arabi said in the rulings, on our scholars, the money means the money and it was not followed by it, and it is not a renovation.The perspective is to me, in remembrance and ethnicity, either the name is if it is the memory and the obedience is realistic, otherwise it is the case of the name of the one who is the one who is the flag of the one, The name is based on a capacity, such as the name of the well.(P-392) And his saying is the Almighty, and it is not permissible for them to give you what God has created in their wombs.Farewell.It is a news about the legislation, for it is a flag for them with that, and God did not create in their wombs, it is blood and it is the same as the news of the news of it, not the same as the same, as the one who is the same With all the two sins, that is, I did not.And God has not created in their wombs, so it is permissible to carry it on the covenant: that is, what was created from the menstruation of the corner of the context.It is permissible to carry it in the sense of the knowledge of the slander, so the menstruation and the bearing, which is the phenomenon, is from the year that is mentioned in a special reason; Because the general memorization mentioned in the Qur’an is the following of the remembrance of some of his individuals, they have followed him in the year that is mentioned in a special reason, but whoever is short of the uncle in the curse In particular, what was mentioned before it, so the incidence of the possibilities of the measure of the measurement, because the judgment is involved in the concept of what God created in their wombs.And this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who created the interpreters, and the Zahri, and al -Nakha’i said: God did not create in their wombs: the menstruation, and the son of Abbas and Omar said: It appeared, and Qutdah said: It was the usual of the ignorance of the ignorance to give the bearing, so that the newborn is attached to the new jaw The children and in that were descended, and this requires that the enemy was not in their place, and with the entrepreneurship of the enemy, the enemy is not fired; Because the bearing is only with the decay of the menstruation, and when the period of the readers went on, it turns out that the bearing is from the new husband.And say it if it is He believes in God and the last day is a condition in which I want to be guided without piety, so it is used in a sense other than the meaning The representative, as the news is used to be broken, and the supply, because there is no meaning to feed the denial of the bearer in their formation, if it is a believer, and if there is a believer, and if it is a believer, and if it is in you The curtain does not exceed the ruling and Islamic forbidden, but the meaning is that if they are fulfilled, they do not believe in God and the last day; It is not from the believer.It came in this condition, because, because it is the origin of the tools of the condition, there is no intention to achieve the stipulation of the condition, then it will come, then if it is, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then the condition is, There is no intention to investigate it, nor to its numbers, come if.It is not here, something of the meaning of the suspicion in the condition of the condition, and do not download their faith, the investigator, the hideout of the doubt, because it is not evaluated, the unprepared.(P-393) What is meant by faith in God and the last day is the full faith, which is faith in what the religion of Islam came with, so there is no faith in the people of the book, with God, and the day of the day, As there is no meaning to the link of the denial of the lamb in Islam with the determination of the faith of the book of the book.And there is no evidence in the verse on the truth of the women, in the case of lamb and menstruation, as it runs on a many years of jurisprudence, so it is necessary to be taken into account that it is a saying that is the saying He was given in their honesty, and the destiny was required to what is achieved, and to the words of kindergarten and knowledgeable.Therefore, Malik said: If the same reader claimed, the elimination of its enemy, in the period of a month of divorce, was not believed, and it was not believed in the least of five, and the fourth of them, and the fourth of them, Abd al -Malik said: Fifths on one day, and Ibn Al -Arabi said: Do not believe in less than three months, because he is the majority in the period in which three are three, and three of the readers of the age of three Younis, as Ibn Naji conveyed it, and the work of Fez, as the record was transmitted.In the verse, it is indicative that the divorced woman is not believed in its saying: it has passed its number.And his saying and their dependence.Al -Baladah is a whole, and the name is the name of the woman's husband.And the origin of the heart in their words, the master.It is an old, high word, so the Knatis called “the Veneqiqi” with their servants.Because he is the king of the aftermath of his husband, and because the husband was considering your money for women, and a master for her, so he was true to this name, then the regime of the name of Peace be upon him, so what was after him from the bouquet, took the meaning of the king in the wives, weakening, so the Arabs were released to memorize the husband on each of the man, and the man is from the man, and the man is from the man, and the man is from the man, A grace of marriage, and it is a fair launch; because The husband is the one who praises the individual, so they became in the name, and the Qur’an has crossed this name, in the most difficult position On the basis of the sheikh [Hood: 72], and other places in which he referred to the memory of what the husband is of leaders, we say it, and if a woman is afraid of the woman, or a woman who is afraid of the woman: And the verse is like that, because when he made the right of the return to the man, he was forced into the woman, reminding the woman that he is a valid, and it was said: Because it is a symbolism to the power of the male, and for that the trees that are not watered, and his collection came on the weight of a verb, and the origin of the action of the Doing, but there is an increase in the distraction for the understanding of the meaning of the group in it, and the counterpart of their saying: a state, a male, a heels, and a gang, a gang, a gum, The mountain, and the increase in the distraction in its example.Because it does not give permission in this sense, it is not the affirmation of the meaning of the group with the meaning of the group.And their pronounced, domesticated to the divorcees before him, and they are the divorced women, as they were presented, so God has blessed them, the highest divorce They divorced them, and the name of the slander is released on the divorced people, so its apparent necessity is that they are married to the divorcees, except that the release of the divorce of them is a creation of the fabrication God made the duration of the enemy expanding the divorced people, so that they would have spoken to them as a regret and a desire for the return of their waves; For his saying, “Do not know that God may happen after that” [Divorce: 1], that is, the matter of the bullied, and that is his youth with what the project has been rewarded, and the legitimacy is in the way, so what is the validity of the law.This is the case, a condition and a simplicity between the condition of the curtains and the condition of the faulty, and on the adoption of this medium case, the name of the curse is here, and it is the metaphor of the Qur’an, Receive what it was, the same as the launch of the orphans in its saying, and the coming of the millions [Women: 2].The gathering was carried by the metaphor; They have expressed the divorce, as a reactionary woman, as a woman, from the divorce, according to the divorce, but when the divorced woman was not the right to the right, as long as the right is the right, as long as the right, as long And if it is satisfied with her consent, the two conditions must be taken, and this is the saying of Malik and Al -Shafi’i.Malik said: It is not permissible for a divorced to enjoy the divorce of the return, nor that he will enter it with a bid, then if it is not the rest of it It is for him to the sebus, and it is obligatory to be disobeyed from the corrupt water, and if it was a severity, he would not have married another woman, as long as that number.Rather, it was obligatory because it is a loved one to wait for its reference, and it is formed on their saying that Uthaman was judged by the inheritance if he died, divorced It is in the enemy; He was judged in the woman of Abd al -Rahman ibn Afaf, with the end of the authority, narrated it in Al -Muwati, so the forms are paid that the elimination of the enemy is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a condition of What is forbidden from the inheritance, as the enemy does not pass, the divorce is repeated between the work and the abolition, so that became a doubt about the prohibition of inheritance, and the doubt in the obstacles is the eruption of its.Abu Hanifa was pregnant, and Al -Layth ibn Sa`d, al -Baladah on the truth, said the young woman is dubbed between the divorced and divorced divorced; Because God called them a luminous and the entry of the divorced woman, and if it was slowed down, then he would be referred to when Abi Hanifa.And Al-Awsa’i, Al-Awiri, Ibn Abi Lali, and attributed to (P-395), Said Bin Al-Masib, Al-Hassan, Al-Zahri, Ibn Sirin, Gay, and some companions.And I think that these are the ones who said the meeting between the divorced divorced and its absolute divorce.(And the most right) It was said: It is in the sense of the name of the actor, the composition of the compassion, which brought it to benefit the power of their right, and that is what is used in it, as it is the form of the form of it, And the remembrance of God is greater [the spider: 45], especially if it is not mentioned after its preference for it with a letter from, and it was said: It is a preference on his door, and the preference is for him.The scouts, and Al -Tafazani decided by what it is obtained and his evidentness: that the impact between the two sinks is the right of those who are different from the disagreement of the suspension: they are the right of the one who is the right He wanted it, and the right of the woman to abstain from the boundaries if it is her father, so the meaning became: and they were the right to return the divorced woman, from the right of the divorcees with the right of the divorce On the way of brevity.And he said in that signal by saying that to the table, in the sense of its duration, that is, for the sake of the right to return in the period of the three readers, that is, no.As it is the concept of the old.This is a report of the meaning of the verse, on the authority of the ruling of the bound in divorce, as long as the number is, and when this is not a pretext, it is not the same as the goodness of the one, For two things: the ruling of the bullied, and the divorced people are brought to the references of the divorcees, and so that the separators.One of them must be, or for both of them, a desire for return, for God knows the men that they are over that they will desire in the goodbye of the women, and that they will be desired, The divorce was obligatory because the man is the suspicion of insight and the involvement, and the woman is the people of anger and the fathers.And the response is presented to him when he said, so that they will return you from your religion [Al -Baqarah: 217] and what is meant by here is the return to the pans, and it is the restoration, and it is the restoration, and it is the restoration, It is more likely that divorce has been considered a piece of the sheep of the marriage, so it is a true divorce on the saying of your money, and the father of Hanifa and who is the one who woke Explanation in response: that the infallibility is in the period of the enemy is a man who is in the way of the disappearance when the enemy is fulfilled, so the reference was called in response It is a metaphorical response.And his saying if they wanted to be a condition, a condition that the urging is intended on the will of the gathering, and it is not to be able.* * * (P-396) and they have the same as those who are known to the well-being and the men have a dedication, and God is a dear wise, and it is not permissible for him to be a guerrilla, and he is a guilt, The divorcees, on the coordination of the bridle before it; Because the divorced women did not remain between them and between the men with a relationship, until they have rights, and they have rights, so you will be aware of the one who is the one They needed his saying in their return with a cocoon of his compatibility with his saying and the men of them with a degree.What is meant by the men in his saying and for the men is the righteous, as if it was said: and their men have a degree.And the man, if added to the woman, was said: A man of Foldah, he was in the sense of the husband, as it is said to the wife: the woman of Flas, so he said: It is permissible for the guarantor to return to the women in his saying to those who hope from their women [Al -Baqarah: 226] on the occasion that the abuse of the women is a digestion of the sake of the sake of the people, if it is not for them, if they are not.This is the whole judgment on that special reason for the occasion; The words are rejoicing from the remembrance of the farewell in the infallibility, when they mentioned their divorce with his saying, and if they are determined to divorce [Al -Baqarah: 227], to the remembrance of the divorce, and the divorce of the divorce The ruling on the divorce of his saying and their dependence on their own in their coldness in that, those of the divorced women became the Zojat, so the guilt returned to them, with the goodness of the The description that begins with it in the judgment, so it was in the verse a beaten from the reaction of the reward for the chest, so it returned to the rulings of the zooms, with the wonders of the wonders: They are on them, and he appeared in what God has made for the husband from the right to behave in the infallibility, so it is appropriate to remember that the women have the right to the same for the men.In the verse, you will be able, and it is appreciated: they have the same as the men who are for the men, so he was deleted from the first to the last of the last, and by reverse.The acquisition was the remembrance of the women of the right to the men, and to simulate it with the men of the women; Because the rights of men on women are famous, a Muslim from the feet of human beings.And he dies to the fate of the woman at her husband, until Islam came and established it.And the greatest of what I found is what this verse had collected.(P-397) The custodian is to be able to fulfill the news; Because it is one of the news that is not signed by, So he listened to listening to the chain of transmission to him, by disagreeing what if he was late, he said: And the same as those who have them for the well -known.In this, a declaration of the rights of women, a creativity of it and a praise of its remembrance, and the same as that of its matter to be received by the expression, so this was the place of the place.That is that the condition of the woman towards the man in the ignorance was a wife or others, it is a condition that was a mixed between the appearance of dignity, and the competence of the desire, And the lack of fairness, when anger, the first is a matter of what the Arab was made from the birth of the Lord to the woman, and the love of love, so the ritual was the ritual.It is competing, a desire to obtain it with the faces of the well -known pamphlets with them, and the wife was a domain from the husband, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: Murr ibn Muhkan Al -Saadi: O Lord of the house, my life, other than a shame, I will be guided to you, the mercy of the people and the kinship, so the Lord of the house, and he addressed it.So he followed the matter with his saying (other than a junior), and the second is the man, with that, the wife sees the one who is made for its servants, so if it is angry, it is angry, and it is angry, or it is angry, or it is angry, and it is angry.The fear of the treatment, and if their opinion violates it, it will be forced to follow it, rightly or without it, and the Arabs were in these two perspectives in these two perseverances in the same way Civilization and Bedouin, and their individuals were missing in the horse and glimmering, and the state of their women was missed in Islam, the fathers, the honor, and its exaggeration, al -Bukhari narrated from Omar The twentieth of the Quraysh, we will be caught by the women, so when we came to the supporters, if a people whose captivating their misfortunes will be lost, then we will be taken away from the literature of the supporters of the support So she returned to me, and I deny that you traveled to me, and she said: And you did not deny that I will return you, and God is that the wives of the Prophet will return to it, and if one of them is to be immigrated to the day So, I said: I disappointed with those who did that from them, then I gathered my clothes on me, and I went down, and I entered on the thunderbolt, so I said to it: that is, I am angry.Today until night?She said: Yes, I said: You have been disappointed and lost the hadith.And in a narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas on his authority: We were in the ignorance, we are not the same as anything Something of our affairs.It is appointed to be this speech for what is in the other narration, which is his saying: We were (P-398), the ten Quraysh, who is the one who is a woman, to the last.It indicated that the people of Mecca were more severe than the people of the city in the treatment of women.And I think that the people of the city were among the greatest Yemeni, and the Yemeni is old in the country of the Arabs in civilization, and there was an increase in them.And in the hadith, “A family came to you The Yemeni are the finest of the hearts and the two hearts, faith is safe and the rule is a right -wing.The ignorance, if a man dies, his first one has the right to his wife, if he wants to marry her if she comes to him, and if they wanted to marry her, they will not, and if they want, then they would not be.Among them, he is the right of that, so the verse of you, O you who believed, is not permissible for you to inherit the women of his hatred [Women: 19].His companions, and my brother among the immigrants.To describe his money and said to him: I see any of my husbands.The sentence of what he reconciled is all the conditions of human beings, and the righteous rights of the husbands are linked to a face, and there was no income with him to giving up the things that are not the same.The arbitration said, “If you fear the hardships of them, then send a judgment of his family and a ruling from its people if he wants a prayer that will agree between them [the women: 35] A pledge of the same.The counterpart and the similarity, such as the young and the like, may be presented in the saying of the exalted, like the example His characteristics, and he may be like him.His two, and it has appeared here that he does not straighten the meaning of the similar in the paths of the conditions and the rights: ransoms, types, or special, because the enemy is required, and the one who is required And the requirement of the project, the violation between many of the men and women in the system of age and the censorship.It is noteworthy to the meaning of the similar in the types of rights on the scope of which it is shown in the consequences of the project, so it is not deluded that if (P-399) it is obligatory for the woman to take place His food is that it is like that, as it is not deluded that it is obligatory to spend on his wife that it is obligatory for the woman to spend on the authority of the woman, as it is for the sake And his food is prepared upon him, which is to prohibit the house and to bring it to the murder and the gravity, and as he embraces his son, he must suffice him Al -Ratzaq in order not to be accused of his son, and to pledge it with his knowledge and discipline, and you do not marry him with a husband in the time of his soul And between an other wife, so that it does not feel a guest, so it will be in a house of those who are not married to it, and on this measure, then if the whole is the same The woman is to improve the pensions of her husband, with the evidence of what was arranged on the ruling of the emergence.And they adore them with the well -known [Women: 19] and it was preserved for itself from others who are not a husband, and it is like that, so that they are not in the same way Their sights and keep their consolidates, so it is the best for them [Al -Nur: 30] Then he said: And say to the believers, they will be overwhelmed by their eyesight and memorize their rituals [31] For their promotions, they are preserved [the believers: 5] except for their waves [the believers: 6] unless it has another wife for him, then this is a ruling, and he enters Dragha and the similarity in the mission of the two wishes, and the similarity in the pastor, in the hadith: “The man is a shepherd on his family and the woman is a shepherd in the house of her husband,” Excellency, if they wanted to be separated from them and disagreed with them [Al -Baqarah: 233], and command between you with knowledge [Divorce: 6].And the consequences of his similar charm, with the eyes or by the end, takes from the consequences of the provisions of the project, and refer it to the negative of the damage, and to the memorization of the sake Its saying is the Almighty saying to the well -known, that is, they have a right that is composed of the well -known, other than the denial, from the requirement of the phase, the etiquette, the interest, and the righteousness.All of them are the field of the eyes of the mujtahidin.And I did not see the books of the vicinity of the doctrine as a repentance of the doors that collect the rights of the two.And in the Sunnah of Abu Dawid, and the Sunnah of the son of
