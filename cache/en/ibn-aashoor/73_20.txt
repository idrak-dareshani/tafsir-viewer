The Quranic researcher is that your Lord knows that you are lower than the nights of the night and his description, his third, and a group of those with you, and God is able to do the night, and the day is not.Read the lease of the Qur’an from here, starting from this surah in the city as its remembrance is presented at the beginning of the surah.And the rest of this verse calls on the fact that the Prophet ﷺ was rising from the night before the revelation of the verse and that a group of his companions was doing a work of the matter The night, the night, is a little [Al -Muzammil: 2], so that this verse was descended to the relief of all of them, for all of them.Who is the first of the surah.(P-279) The predecessor was missed at the time of its descent, its place, and in the proportions of it, which is required from the requirement of the verse before it.And the well -known is the one who is the one who was the one who was the chest of the Surah.It is not deceived by what Al -Tabiri narrated from Abu Salma ibn Abd al -Rahman on the authority of Aisha, which deludes that the Surda was revealed in the city.And the same is what was narrated from Al -Nakhi in the domination of a devastation of Aisha.It is not necessary that the saying affects that the resurrection that was made in the chest of the Surah was a ritual and obligatory to the Prophet ﷺ in particular, and that the rise of those who rose from the Muslims with him with him And the Prophet ﷺ was approved by him, but Aisha saw that the abuse of the five prayers was copied and the night was required, and she wants that the night of the night was the one Tawlil, as it is not necessary to be different in that the first of what God has to do with the nation is the five prayers that were imposed on the night of the naked and that it was not the same The nation, and if it was a masculinity of his masculinity with the five prayers in the hadith of the naked, and that the fifth of the five is on the one who is like the one.This is the saying of Ibn Abbas; Because he said: The rise of the night did not copy it except a verse that your Lord knows that you are lower than the two thirds The imposition of the resurrection on the prophet ﷺ only that it is the copying of the half of the night or without it with a few, so we copied it, so read what is easy from the Qur’an.This was explained by the hadith of Ibn Abbas, a night in the house of his aunt, the mother of the believers, who said: “The Messenger of God slept ﷺ and the family He accepted him with a few or after him with a few who wake up the Messenger of God, then he described his light and that he prayed three ten rak'ahs, then he slept until he came to him.And the son of Abbas, then a boy, so that there will be seven or eight years of migration.It was not transmitted that the Muslims were doing with him until he was brought up.Ramadan, and his companions were forgiven, so they would be forgotten to the mosque to pray with the prayer of their Prophet ﷺ until he was confused about them in one of the loyalty, and he said to them.That is in the city and Aisha, as it was presented at the beginning of the surah.(P-280) It is clear in the fact that the resurrection that they did with the Messenger ﷺ was not an imposition of them and that they did not sleep on him and that there is nothing The Muslims, otherwise it was not for fear that a satellite is exposed to them; Because if it was estimated that some of the nights were the exhibits, they were with the prophet ﷺ in order to perform that of the supplies, and this was the same as the hadith He said to Hafsa, and I have told him a vision that Abdullah bin Omar saw that Abdullah is a righteous man, even if he would rise up at night.And open the words that your Lord knows that you feel that he feels for him to fulfill the right of resurrection that he commanded him and that he was to him, and he was not for him.The fate in which the half is in which it is a little or is a few or the excess of it, but he took the Qasqa, and that is what is close to the three of the nights, as is the same as the one who said: ﷺ In his words, he is up to the Almighty, when Moses made the deadline [Al -Qasas: 29] that he spent the maximum lapse, which is the twenty years.And it came in the hadith that the Prophet ﷺ "he was arising from the night until its feet were honored." And the assertion of the news (that) is to be fulfilled by it, and it is a severity that he is satisfied with his Lord with that and a slowdown in the light that will be mentioned in the saying Divestation of mercy, dignity, and emptying some time from the day for work and jihad.And there is still a lot after the abandonment of the prophet ﷺ by managing the Muslims ’reconciliation and the mother -in -law of the city and the purpose of the gossip, and the grace of that The capacity has no place in his place in Mecca, and the wisdom of God appeared in relieving his Messenger ﷺ from the obligatory night of the night.And in the hadith of Ali ibn Abi Talib that he was asked about the Prophet ﷺ if he was harbored to his house, and he said: “If he had to his house, his entry was three parts of his entry, part of the part of his entry.For his family, a part of itself, then his part is between him and between people, so he returns that in the private of the general public and does not smoke from them, and for them from the pilgrimage, and for them from the pilgrimage, and for them from the need, The neighborhoods, so they are occupied by them and occupy them as they reconcile them and the nation from his question about them and their telling of them who want them." (P-281) and the altruism of the harms in its saying (knowing) to the significance of that science and its renewal, and that marks that it is in the place of contentment from it.And against him, God has known those who are standing from you [Al -Ahzab: 18]; Because it is in the exposure When a time is not hidden from it.And (lower) originally: closer, from the world, release to the least; Because the distance between the thing and the lowest of it is a little, and the distance is naughty for more.It is a tendency to do so, for a verb (you stand), meaning: it is established in a time that is estimated at least than two thirds Excellency or increase it [Al -Muzzammil: 4].And the jams (two thirds) read the complication of the mother at the original.Hesham read it on the authority of Ibn Amir, with the homing of the lame on to reduce; Because he showed him some of the heaviness with the cause of triangle.Nafaa, Ibn Amir, Abu Amr, and Abu Jaafar, and Jacob (and his description and his third), were read by their reduce Third.Ibn Katheer, Asam, Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i read, and a successor (and his half and his third) on the authority that they are based on the verb of the one who is ( The half of the night will take place, and the third of the night will take place, where the half is not short of the third.This is a different conditions in the Prophet ﷺ at night, a follower of the contradiction of the conditions of the loyalty and the days in the length of each other and the palace of one, and all of them are inside.May God grant him the words of the night, except for a few [Al -Muzammil: 2] to his saying or increase it [Al -Muzammil: 4].And with the appearance of the occasion of the punishment of this sentence in the supposed sentence, and it is a sentence, and God appreciates the night and the day, that is: God has known it.The intended does not differ from the contradiction of the readings.It is wondering, saying that the monument is more likely.And (a sect) is a compassion at the name (if) by raising, which is a permitted face if it is after the mention of the news (if); Because he is able to raise his raising at that time, as he said, as God Almighty said that God is innocent of the two participants and His Messenger [Repentance: 3].It is one of the kindness if it is the equivalent of the name and the kind (P-282) with the different news, then between the righteousness of the Prophet ﷺ and the rise of the sect with which the ritual, and the ritual, and the ritual, and the ritual, and the ritual, and the ritual in the ritual The light of God is one of the participants and the brightness of His Messenger.The Messenger ﷺ calls them and reads the Qur’an and treats them, and God is angry with them.This is the face of the enemy from saying: God knows that you are standing.To his saying (that you are standing) then his saying (and a group) etc.And described (a sect) that they are among those with you, if it is intended by the sufficient awareness, that is, the accompaniment is in the work of what is for what the words of the words of the words, The night, and it was not in his interpretation of people with their people, in the hadith of Aisha in the authenticity of Al -Bukhari, “The Messenger of God ﷺ prayed in the same way With his prayers, people, then prayed from the capabilities, so the people were many, then they gathered from the night The third or the lobby, and the Messenger of God did not come out to them ﷺ So when he became, he said: I saw the one who made you and did not prevent me from the abandonment of you And that is in Ramadan.Al -Farisi and Abu Al -Darada, and Zenab Banat Jahsh, Abdullah Bin Omar, and Al -Hawalat Banat Tawit al -Asalah Al -Bukhari.He knows that you are intending to be satisfied with them, so they did.Return the verb (knowledge) in a sentence of knowledge that he will be satisfied with you, etc.Among my sentences, your Lord knows that you are rising and the sentence of it that you will not count it and you have learned the occasion of its synthesis of nose.It is a second news from (that) after the news in his saying, you know that you are lower than two thirds of the night, etc.Your Lord knows that you are rising from the thymieh to know what he is devoted to that sentences, so after they thank them for their work.(You will be counted) Something many made for each one to be a habit, and it is a bothering of the ritual.Al -Hasan and Safyan were interpreted, and it is his saying in the hadith, “Restore and you will not be counted.” Al -Thaqilah, and its name is the guarantee of a deleted one, and the sentence was told, and the chapter was fell between (that) and its informing it of the navigator’s rituals to make the news of the goodness, and there is no good.The follower in the eloquent recovery.You and the verb (repentance) is a slogan for the bond of taking before the shortcomings of the default; The failure in it with the act of (repentance), the raising Declaration after his obtaining.And the face is that the speech is in his saying (you counted it) and after it goes to the Muslims who were the night: After his saying and a group of those with you, or on the way of the public that is intended for the privacy in a village that the Prophet ﷺ does not think that the statistics are excused, He will be satisfied with you, etc.And the meaning of the Qur’an is easy for the Qur’an, so they separate what is easy for you, and when the prayer was not devoid The Qur’an, that is: (p-284), pray as the Almighty saying (and the Qur’an of the dawn), meaning: the prayer of the dawn, and in the kiniyah on the authority of the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the way of the rituals in the ritual in the ritual in the Qur’an The recitation of the Qur’an in it with a way of briefing.And what is meant by the Qur’an, which was revealed before this civil verse, which is many of the Qur’an, all of which is all of the city, and it is not the same as the saying And the Qur’an recited a tradition [Al -Muzzammil: 4] as you taught you.And his saying is what is easy from the Qur’an, that is: what is easy for you from the night prayer, there is no significance in this verse on the validity of what is divided into the readers in the prayer, if it is not in the prayer.The virtue, and if our peace is, then it is not possible for a summary and has explained the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “There is no prayer for those who did not read the opening of the book.” It is narrated from him that he has read in the prayer less than a surah, and it is the duty when the jurisprudence was brought up, so he will repeat it to read the chapel some surah in the flood.It is permissible to do the Qur’an in the night and in the rise of Ramadan, and when the freedom, in the correctness, “The Prophet ﷺ used to read, so I took it.” And Abu Hanifa and Ahmad said in a narration about him: The readers of a verse of the Qur’an are divided, even if it was short, and the Hanafi is represented by the saying of the two: [64] The Fatwa of the Book is appointed, and its owner is in the face of the two things.And those who have to be unjust from the ingredient, imam, and imam who are shown in the books of jurisprudence.And the verb (repentance) if he wants the acceptance of the repentance of the repentance, the nomadic of a ritual (Ali) to join it with the meaning of it, and if it is in the sense of the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one It is appropriate.This verse has copied the period of the night of the night with his descriptions, or more, or the least of its third, and I am accompanied by the limit of the one who is the same As for the ruling of that resurrection, it is what his explanation came.* * * (P-285) Know that you will be satisfied and others who will strike in the land, seeking the grace of God and others fighting in the path of God, so read what is good And pay zakat and loan God with a good loan, this sentence is a substitute Distinguish from a sentence that you will not be counted, and this is another diminishing for the sake of other conditions that required the diminishing.This is an other wisdom for the transcription of the end of the time in the attempt, and it is the observance of the conditions that emerged from the Muslims from the background of what you call for the state of the Islamic.Three of these are reminded of the origins of excuses: the first warning: the excuses of the sacrifice of health and the comprehensiveness of it was said that it will be satisfactory from you.The second inch: the work that calls for the dowry of live in trading, industry, plow, and otherwise, and it was referred to it, and others will be harmed.And the grace of God is the sustenance.The third of the ritual: Publish the call of Islam from the disposal of the Woods and the mission of the travel.This is all of the nation’s affairs on the nods, so he enters into it with the prophet ﷺ as in the fighting in the path of God, and the sick, in the hadith, “I disagree with the Messenger of God.Lolitan." And if this verse is what was descended by the Mecca, then it is in the view that the Muslims are ahead of the Muslims, who are ahead of the Muslim, and they are ahead of their enemies, and he will be fought in the same It is an excuse for them what they started from the companies and the invasions.Some of the companions were first from this verse, as the virtue of the merchants and the travel to the merchants, where God is between the two and the places, and the rituals are the money, (P-286) These two captives are to copy the defense of resurrection, not to intend them to them; Because other than excuses are what is more like the disease, and the Quran and its sects are not confined.It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Masoud that he said: Whatever is a man who has lost anything to a city of Muslims, the Muslims were attributed, so he sold him with the price of his day, and he was the day And he read and others who are setting in the land, seeking the grace of God and others fighting in the path of God.And on the authority of Ibn Omar, “God did not create a death after the death in the path of God, I love me that I will die among my people, my mercy, and the grace of God.” If this verse is from what was descended in the Mecca, then it is clear that the Muslims are ahead of the Muslims, who are of their enemy.To them.And the meaning of them will be set in the land.And the truth of the war: a bodies of another body, and the path was called in the earth, a crushing in the land to include a verb (they will be) To the land with the two men, but it is obsessed with the meaning of the warning, and I want the walk, so this is an enemy with a letter (in); Because the earth is a kind of way, as he said, so they will walk in the earth [Al Imran: 137] And you may have the words of the Almighty, and if you are beaten in the earth, there is no wing for you to shorten the prayer [Women: 101] in the Wall of the Night.And the abuse of the grace of God: the request of the sustenance, the exalted, there is no wing to you to seek a virtue of your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 198], meaning: the merchant in the praise of the Hajj, so that the pilgrimage is in the pilgrimage.The earth is seeking the grace of God, intending to strike in the land in which the travel is for the merchant; Because the walk in the travels is in the night a lot and is in the day, so the traveling needs for the day in the day.And he was seized by him, like what he was raised on the one who was before him, and he said: Read what is easy from him, that is: from the Qur’an.The fate of doing the facilitation of all Muslims, even if the excuses were disappeared.This verse requires the raising of the prayer of the night from the Muslims if it was obligatory for them before one of the two impersonations, or if it was not for them, and it was not for me The time is it, and it was clear (P-287) to them that what the adultery is from the descent of the Prophet ﷺ in that is not necessary for them.And the soul of his must be upon them that the nation abounds in it, with the people of excuses, with which the night is made, and he did not make it and God has to do.And had it not been for the general thought of the ruling, the ruling of the resurrection would be for the sake of the people of the excuse in the period of excuse, so then, it will be found that this is the case.And the ruling is here, meaning, that is: the numbness of the answers, so it is the counterpart of the palace of prayer in traveling on the saying of Aisha, the mother of the believers: The prayer is that there is a rally of three The prayers in the presence, and the prayer of travel was kept, and the cause of the meeting of the two rak'ahs is the suspicion of the hardship in the travel.It is necessary to make a license in the night that it was not a pillar of Islam, so the religious reconciliation was not strong in it.As for the ruling of the resurrection, it is what is indicated by the night, the night is a few [Al -Muzzammil: 2] and what was indicated by the evidence of the urbanization of it from the Sunnah.And all of that has passed.This verse is righteous because it is the origin of the angels with the thought and a valid for it to be inherently measured by the general license in which the one who takes care of the one in which it is taken into account Like the privilege of selling peace without the individual and partial conditions.And his saying and evaluated the prayer is a reminder that the obligatory prayers are the ones that are keen on its residency and the number of deviations in it, as he said that the prayer was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the prayer [Women: 103].And in this punishment for the kindness of the matter by establishing the prayer, there is a gesture that in the fifth prayers, the lifting of followers from the believers is that the night is the night, and there is no one who has a long time.The effects were added to this in the books of the Sunnah.And they are compassionate and the zakat is permitted; Because it is mostly The remembrance of the prayer did not give up from the horn of zakat with it until the father of Bakr was assigned - may God be pleased with him - from that that what is forbidden to pay it is to fight it, so he said: To fight those who separated between prayer and zakat.And the lending of God is the charity other than the duty, the likeness of giving the charity to the poor with a loan that God has grieved; Because God promised charity with the rewarding reward, he liked the state of giving charity, responding to the desire of God in it, in the case of those who are subject to the one who is subject I loan it, and that is in the reward that it gives to the day of the penalty.(P-288) And described the loan with good deeds that benefit the charity that is intended by the face of God Almighty and the peace of the time and harm, and goodness is vary.And the good in every type is what is in which the enthusiastic adjectives in that type are in its door, and the Mahmud is known from the charity from the way of the ritual in what is in the way of the ritual in the Qur’an and the righteousness of the Qur’an in The words of the Prophet ﷺ from that.It was presented in the cow of the cow, saying: Whoever lends to God a good loan, and he will be multiplied by him a lot.Well, he will be doubled for you [Al -Taghabun: 17].* * * And what you offer to yourself is the best you find for God is good and great reward for a sacrifice for what was before the matter in his saying, and they will read what they are.Zakat and loaned to God a good loan, because his saying (from the best) is good for all the deeds of good.And in the words, the briefing of a deletion.Fatening of the deleted: and do the good and what you are presented to breathe from it, you find it with God, so I seek the deletion of the remembrance of the reward.And (what) is a condition.And the meaning of the prohibition of good: its action in life, the likeness of the deed of goodness in the period of life for the hope of the benefit of its rewards in the last life of the one who is the one who is the one And his consequences and some of his family to the place that the end of the end to him to find what he benefits from the time.And (from the best) of the Petroleum (what).And the other: it is what the religion described with goodness and prepared for his action with reward.And the meaning of (find it) find his reward and reward, and he who intended him to do it, as if he found the soul of his present The compensation of the thing and its parts in the name of the compensation for it and the metaphor of it, and the saying of the Prophet ﷺ in the one who makes the money and does not perform its right to it.He takes his defeat, saying: I am your money, I am your treasure." And the dispensation of the absent in (you find it) is the first effective of (found) and its second effective (good).(P-289) The separate guarantee that among them is the guarantee of a verb, and it is permissible to fall between a know Its fall Between two knowledge; Because I do so, like this, that it is not permissible to enter the letter of knowledge on it.And (good): the name is a preference, that is, it is better than what you offer, as it is not intended that you find it from the gender of the good, but what is meant is the waste of the reward, for the sake If you lend to God a good loan, which will be doubled by you [Al -Taghabun: 17], and that is not of many verses.The conscience of the chapter here reported here the confirmation of his investigation.He composed and exalted a reward for (good) or is a withdrawal upon which he affirms the conscience of the chapter.And he (wage) was based on the fact that it is a lineage of (great); Because it is in the sense of the verb.The estimation: the greatest reward, as it says: I found it as a palm, and the meaning: that its reward is better and greater than what you presented.* * * And seek forgiveness from God that God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.It is permissible for the waw to be to be kind, so it will be given to a sentence and what you are presented to you The judgment of the appendix is ​​a guidance for your condemnation, so that it may be exposed to the excitement in some of what God has commanded by his present Toph of it.It is permissible for the waw to be for the nose, and the sentence will be a bayyan exhaustion arising from the relaxation in leaving some of the righteousness from the guidance of God for the sake He who is exposed to his blessing by seeking forgiveness from the Muslim, his Lord, if he pays attention from the parts of the night, and it is included in his saying of the Almighty (P-290), and with the sins of the sins: [18] The Prophet ﷺ said, “Our Lord will descend every night to the sky of the world when the third of the last night remains, and he says: Whoever calls me, then respond to him, whoever asks me, whoever asks me, whoever asks me, whoever asks me, whoever asks me I ask forgiveness for me, and I forgive him, and he said, “Whoever talents the night, he said: There is no god but God, and he will not be his partner, and he has the king, and he has the same for him Glory be to God, and no god but God, and God is greater, no one, and no power except with God, and then God said, forgive me or let me respond to him." And the sentence is that God is forgiving, merciful, anxious to the matter of asking for forgiveness, i.E.:; Because God is a lot of forgiveness.What is intended in this treatment is desirable and urged to seek forgiveness that it is a manifestation of the answer.And in the two clear descriptions of the exaggeration in the adjective, there is no gesture to promise the answer.* * * (P-291) in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Qirwan in the fifth century.And I want the prophetic influence ﷺ to be described in the case that we would like, as some of the walls were called with the names of the prophets who mentioned it.Either it is called the memorial in which it was located, and its counterpart is what was presented in The name (Surah Al -Muzamal), and the same is what was presented in the wall of the argument from the enforcement of the sign or its bridal.It is an angel who narrated the agreement on that Ibn Attiyah and Al -Qarbi and did not mention it in mastery in the light that is a civilian.Al -Alwsi mentioned that the owner of the liberation - Muhammad ibn al -Nuqib al -Muqdisi, the dead of 698, has an interpretation - he mentioned the saying of a fighter or the saying You only prepared a fascinating [Al -Muddathir: 31] etc., we descended in the city, uh.And we did not stand on his bond in that, nor do we think that for others and will come.(P-292) It was said that it is the second of the light is a descent and that it did not come before it except Sura The revelation is that the Prophet ﷺ came to him the truth while he was in the cave of Hara, so the king came to him, and he said: Read in the name of your Lord who created [Al -Alaq: 1] to what he did not know [Al -Alaq: 5] So you did not remember the descent of a neighborhood after the verses, read in the name of your Lord [Al -Alaq: 1].Likewise, the hadith of Jabir bin Abdullah from the narration of Abu Salma ibn Abd al -Rahman from the many ways, and with the conservation of some of it.And he obtained what is gathered from his way: Jabir ibn Abdullah said, while he talks about the rituals of the revelation, he said in his hadith: The Prophet said: So I looked in front of me and my successor, and for my right, and for my north, and I did not see anything, so I raised my head, so if the king who came to me with the sacrifices of my hearts, I am from the ritual I was terrified, and I came to the cheeks, and I said: They turned me, and they were depleted, "He increased the son of Ibn Shihab from his narrators.Al -Nawwi said: Pour the water to hold the fruits.So, God, O Muddar, [Al -Muddathir: 1] to the ritual, and abandoned [Al -Muddathir: 5], then protect the revelation and follow.It was located in the authenticity of a Muslim on the authority of Jabir: that it is the first Qur’an, the Surah of the Increased, and he is the one who says in his hadith that the Messenger of God talks about the rituals of the ritual Between two things, it requires a neighborhood that came down before Surah Al -Muddhar, which was shown in the hadith of Aisha.It was presented in the chest of Surah Al -Muzamal, the saying of Jabir bin Zaid: that the Surda of the Perfection came down after the surah of the relationship, and that the Surah of the Mazdam is a third of the one.Rada.Jaber bin Zaid said: It came down after the scattered Surah Al -Fatihah.There is no doubt that the script of the script was descended before the jerk, and that the entrepreneur’s stubbornness had been increased after the descent of the script, so the exposure was in the way of the exposure Waste.It was located in the hadith of Jabir bin Abdullah in Sahih al -Bukhari and the whole of the symbols from the way of Ibn Shihab that the descent of this surah was before the prayer.And the prayer was imposed after the time of the revelation, whether it was five or less, and whether it was obligatory as it is the appearance of their saying: it was done, or if it was done, it was not.And the vastness of the Al-Waha (P-293) is different in its period, a lot of disagreement, and it was said that she was two years Forty day.It appears that the inverted came down in the first year of the mission, and that the prayer was imposed by that, as he feels the formation of the son of Isaac in Sir.The people of the city in their enemy promise the last one who has established it, and the people of the Levant, which is five and five, and the people of Basra and the Kufa and the people of the city are the first They returned for five and five.* * * Its purposes came in it from the purposes of the generosity of the prophet ﷺ and the matter of reporting the message of the message.And al -Dhahiya al -Dahiya.And the matter of sensual and meaningful purification.And reject idols.And a lot of charity.And the matter is patient.And the warning of the partners in the Baath.And the guidance of those who are confronting the cursing in the Qur’an, and claimed that it is the saying of the humanity, and the disbelief of the appellant is the grace of God upon him, so he submitted to the sake of the sake of it.And described the horrors of hell.And the response to the participants who hidden it and claimed the few times of its memorization.And the people of the book limit themselves to ignorance of their memorization.And they seek to get rid of the torment.And represent their misguidance in the world.And the intercourse of their condition in the case of the believers, the people of prayer, zakat, and confirmation on the day of the penalty.
