The researcher kills them, where you stopped them and brought them out from where they are brought out and the temptation is more severe than the killing.That their command to fight those who fight them, the baptism of the sites and the Baqa is an increase in the conditions of killing and the permissibility of the blindness The general people of the people who are able to be able to be Muslims who are permissible for that I kill you.And the sentence was compared to before it, and if it is a complement to it, it is an arrogance that what was included in a special killing is not the opposite of the gossip, so the exaltation, Therefore, he said here: “Kill them”, and he did not say: “And they fought them” (P-202) like the verse before it To fight, and that he is the one who has come out with a fight, then he is a killer, and if he was not killed.And (you stopped them) in the sense of their meeting to meet a war, and do it as a joy, and explain it in the scouts that it is in the case of abundance and dominance.And his saying: And I will leave them from where they are brought out, that is: it is permissible for you to come out of the Mecca that they are removed from you, and in this, you will be guided by the people of the So this meeting is for this bush in the souls of the believers, so that they can help him until they realize it and may realize it after the two years, and it is for me, and it is for the sake As he said, the Almighty said: God has believed his Messenger, the right to the truth, to enter the mosque, the forbidden [Al -Fath: 27].And his saying: The temptation is more severe than the killing, and the “Al” has for the Persians that refer to the domination in the speeches, and it is a pilgrimage to the one who is in the hands of the peace Fighting with Mecca, if they have to do it.And the temptation is the meeting of fear and the sister of the regime of living, and it was presented with the words of the Almighty: until they say that we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve it: [102] The believers in Mecca from the harm with the insistence, the harm and the ridicule until the last of it was the one who is from the statements and the money, so the partners are incompatible, then they are the one who is in the past Relax as it went on as the righteousness was forbidden from their taking it; Rather, the temptation was more severe than the killing to repeat its relics with the disagreement of the murder, and it is also intended from the signed temptation by building that it is based They will be tied up with them if they are in the Mecca, and for this, the Muslims are involved in the reconciliation of the Hadaybiyyah that they enter the year in charge The Muslims in their partners and the consequences of the partners in their hearts until they are on the flame Hanging embarrassment.Let it be intended from the temptation, especially the lattice from the diet; Because the dissolution must be a blessings of the spoiling words.* * * (P-203) Do not fight them when the mosque is the forbidden until they fight you in it, for if they fight you, then kill them, as well Performing on a sentence and killing them, where you stopped them, which you benefited from the followers of the fighting with the murder, where they were, whether they were the one who had been blessed, they were the one who was a ritual.A state of transition, or a lord, or the part of that; Because the conditions of the warring are not tied, and they are not at the time to look at his intentions and tampering in his purposes; As he might turn to the assassination of his enemy in the event that he repeats and thinks about him, so the place that was at the mosque is the forbidden of the mosques of the one who said: You stopped them, that is: if you stop them at the mosque, the forbidden is not interested in fighting with you, so do not kill them, and the intention of this God made it for him with his saying: the shrine of Abraham and whoever entered it was safe [Al -Imran: 97], so the verse was required to prevent Muslims from fighting the two participants, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who enjoined the two.They are prevented from killing one of the participants without fighting at the mosque in the forbidden mosque with the core of the discourse or the content of the discourse.The end of the end was made by saying it: until they fight you in it, then if I kill you, kill them, that is: if I kill you at the mosque, then kill them with the mosque; Because they were divided into the forbidden mosque, and if they were left, their treatment would be like that, that was an offspring to the defeat of the Muslims.If the Muslims are killed by the mosque, the Muslims returned to the Muslims, their fights, to what was before this forbidden, so it is obligatory for the Muslim to be upon them The mosque is the forbidden and killed the one who stopped from them like that.And in his words, the Almighty: (Kill them), alert him to the authorization of their killing at that time, and if he did not confuse them with a fight; Because they do not believe that they take the forbidden mosque and a way to defeat the Muslims.For the sake of that, the transit came with his saying: (Kill them) because the murder includes a debt of fighting and the killing is a fight.So the Almighty said: If you kill you, that is: when the mosque is the forbidden, so let them kill them; That is, kill those who have been stood up from them when the warship, and the mosque does not repel you from the exclusion of their effects, so that they do not take the mosque in the forbidden, if the forbidden is a refuge.Be defeated.There were many of the interpreters of these verses from his saying: And fight in the path of God [Al -Baqarah: 190] to his saying here: Likewise, the parts of the disbelievers are so that the disbelievers of the disbelievers To the pretext of copying each other with some (P-204), he claimed that some of them were submitted, some of which were copied.With the origin that the ritual verses in the Surah The one has descended like that and with what the verses are in the forefathers of the compulsion from the pretext of the pretext of the pretext of being, some of which were resigned from his predecessor, and for the sake of what he did not The copying, and among the interpreters who are confined to the interpretation of the abundant paradoxes and the rhetorical compositions, and exposed the suffering of the suffering of the semesters.And the ears of God for the Muslims with the fighting and killing of the fighting with the mosque, the forbidden, and he did not care about what he made for this mosque; Because his prohibition is forbidden to God Almighty, when the disbelief of the disbelievers had a fight for people to prevent him and the tribulation of his debt, so they have become a debt.Therefore, it is our way to fight them, there is a support for the prohibition of mosque.And the generosity read: Do not fight them when the mosque is the forbidden until they fight you in it three by a thousand after the endowment, and he read Hamza and Al -Kasayi: (And do not kill them, then kill them, so that they will kill them, so that they will kill them, so that they will kill them.They killed you) with a thousand after the endowment, so the blind said to Hamza: Did you see your readers, this is how the man would be killer after it became a mortal?And Hamza said: If the Arabs are killed by a man who said: We were killed, he wants to speak on the addition of added from the verb like his saying: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The stream, so they were adhered to the pain and the meaning: and do not kill one of them until they kill each other, so if you kill some of you, then kill those who are able to do so They killed the joint group, and it was in the sense of killing some of them with some Muslims; Because the Arabs are supported by the action of some of the tribe, the mortality, or the difference, because it indicates all of it as a guarantee as it is here, or a phenomenon name, we have: This reader requires that the one who is killed by killing, so the killing is included in your argument with a war and the killing is a bid.The verse was indicated by the advice of the perpetrator of killing the warrior if it was fought in the sanctuary, or it is followed by it; Because the seizure is a fighter; The consensus is that if it was taken into account by an enemy, and he said: I do not fight you and prevent you from the pilgrimage, and there is no joy from the Mecca, so it is obligatory to fight it, even if it did not start the fighting; Al -Qarbi transmitted it from Ibn Khwayz, who is from the ownership of Iraq.Ibn Khwayz Mandad said: As for his saying: Do not fight them when the mosque is the forbidden until they fight you in it, so it is permissible to be a texture with the saying of it: Fita [Al -Baqarah: 193].(P-205) And they differed in its indication of the permissibility of killing the infidel, if it resorted to the forbidden without being a fight, and so if the side is resorting to the deprivation, and the one who is al-Mualla and al-Qaddah, then the one who said, With the palace of that, and it is transmitted to that, by saying that it is the Almighty: If the most famous of the most famous is the deprivation [Tawbah: 5] the verse, then the verse of the verse has been copied and he said: We go away from the time to work with this The verse, and the year delayed from the work, transcribes the private agreement, and the hadith that he narrated in the one who is from Anas ibn Malik, “The Messenger of God ﷺ entered the year of the year The head of the forgiveness, and when he distributed it, Abu Baraza came and said: Ibn Khuttal is attached to the veils of the kaaba, so the Messenger of God said: He kill him.Bin Khukhtal Al -Tayami was from the Islam and then disbelieved after his Islam, and he made his heart the curse of the Messenger of God ﷺ and Islam, so he threw the Prophet ﷺ That is the best of the kaaba, so the Prophet ﷺ was commanded by killing him at that time, so he was killed by Ibn Khattal killing a limit, not killing a war; Because the prophet ﷺ was put the forgiveness from his head and the hour in which God has permitted it has passed in Mecca.And with the measure, which is that the forbidden mosque is determined in the project, so when God authorized the killing of those who fought in the mosque, the forbidden is that the reason is that the cause is that the cause is that the cause is that With his prohibition for the height, so that the perpetrator is in it, and like his saying, Al -Shafi’i said, but Al -Shafi’i said: If the deceased sought refuge to He is hungry to him until he comes out, so if he does not come out, he may kill him, and Abu Hanifa said: The infidel is not killed if he sought refuge in the depriv He has a miserable one, and he is the saying of a jaws and a Mujahid.The lesson on the day of the group, so we are like that, as a man entered a talented man, and peace be upon him, peace and export in the Majlis, so the judge said: He said: A man from the request of knowledge in the way of the dominance of the Shatar, and my intention is this sanctuary deprivation.I asked them, and the Qur'an signed on the question of the infidel, if he sought refuge in the forbidden, is he killed or not, and he answered that he is not killed, so he was asked about the evidence, so he said: You fight them when the mosque is the forbidden until they fight you in it, because if you read: (and do not kill them), then the verse is a text, and if it is read: (and do not fight them), then you will be alerted it; Because if he forbids the fighting, which is the cause of killing, it was a clear indication of the forbidden (P-206) from the killing, so he assumed the adulterers of Al-Zanan They went to them on the habit, so he said: This verse is forgotten by the words of the Almighty: So kill the participants where you found them [Repentance: 5], so he said: The verse in which a general in which I have been subjected to the core, which I crowned with special, and no one is permissible for anyone to say: The year is copying the private, so I died from the judge.The answer is that the year that is delayed from the work of the people is a transcriber, and the hadith of Ibn Khatal indicated that the verse that is in the innocence of the people of the cow’s verse, and the saying Money: The killing of Ibn Khattal was in the day that God has permitted for him in it, and he will pay him that the hour has ended with the conquest, and the conquest is in the conquest, and the conquest of the conquest, God ﷺ We have been removed from the forgiveness, and that is the end of the war of the war.Ibn al -Arabi said in the rulings: The infidel, if he does not fight and does not crazy a crime and resorted to the forbidden, then he does not kill, he wants that he does not kill the killing who is required You stopped them, which is what he said.And his saying: Likewise, the parties of the disbelievers and the indication of the killing taken from his saying: (So kill them), meaning: the killing is also a reward for what you say: We have made you a nation and a simplicity [Al -Baqarah: 143] and the joke of the reference is to show it; That is, the partners of the partners do not diminish the killing, nor a reconciliation in the ears on them, and this is a guidance for them, so he said: (Likewise), and the news of the reign of the And they fought in the path of God [Al -Baqarah: 190] because the fighting is not a penalty; As I do not stand up to it, but the fighting is a debate on one day.And his saying: If they are over, then God is forgiving, merciful, that is: if they end up from your fighting, do not kill them; Because God is Forgiving, Most Merciful, so we will be the forgiveness of the believers of the believers, so he said: “God is forgiven, merciful, the answer to the condition, which is the condition of the condition.As every Samaq knows that God has described the forgiveness and the mercy is not arranged on the end, so he knows that he alerts him to the duty of forgiveness, if the forgiveness is for the forgiveness of the forgiveness.And support for the deleted, and this is the summary of the deletion.And the end: its origin is a folded “forbidding”, it is said: its end, then it is forbidden, then it is expanded in it, so it was released on the palm of the work (P-207) or from the determination; Because the forbidden is a request for leaving a verb, whether the request was after the wearing of the one who is required by the verb or before it was dressed in it.Approved ∗∗∗ and for their rugs in every yellow, that is, on the authority of Al -Qaaq in that.
