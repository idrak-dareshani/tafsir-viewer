Because it is the name of a seat of hell or the name of hell, and a guerrilla (satellite) has been ran over the one who said in his saying, and it will not remain to his saying.It was said that it was an Arab that was transferred in the mastery of the Jawalaqi, and he did not remember the Arabic word, nor from which language is.What do you know about what is a state of a state of (Saqar), meaning: the stroke of which is not mentioned by it, and this is a way to its condition.And (what is decided) in a beginner place, and its origin is a stroke, that is: what it is, it was presented (what); Because it is a name, and he has the chest.The first (what) is exclusive.The meaning: Any thing that realizes you, that is: it teaches you.(P-312) and (what) are the second in the place of raising a news from (Saqqar).And the sentence of (unimaginable) with a detection of the state that a sentence has reported and what I realize is what is decided.The sentence is a second news from (Saqr).And the effect of (keeps) is deleted to the intention of the general, meaning: do not keep them from anyone or do not keep anything from their parts.And a sentence (and does not warn) a kindness on (do not remain), so it is in the sense of the situation.And the meaning does not virginity, that is: you do not leave someone who is thrown into it, that is: do not leave it as a prayer of its torment.This is a way to return His life after his destiny, as he said, as the Almighty said, whenever their gels ripen, we have changed them, so they would not be tired of torment [Women: 56].A pding: a third news about (Saqr).And (a glow) is effective, from the wave, and it changes the self from the pain and its grace, and the poet said, and it is one of the shames of the scouts and I did not stand on his saying: ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ My uncle is to me and human beings: it is a group of human beings, and it is the skin of the human being, that is: the colors of the slaves are changed and make it black, and it will be the name of the gathering of no one.And he said to him about nine ten news, which is raised from (Sakar) from his saying and what I realize what is ancestor.And the meaning of (on it) on its proceedings, so (on) to the salvation of the metaphor with the suspicion and the state of the loyalty, as it is said: so that it is on the authority of the condition, That is, and the meaning: that the storage of a nineteen king.Jumu said: The number of nine ten: The cucumber of the angels who are assigned to the heels.It was said: tenth of ten years of angels, and nineteen rows were said.And in the interpretation of the pride: the arms of the suffering mentioned in the appreciation of this number of faces: one of them is the saying of the people of wisdom: because the corruption of the soul is the powers of the life, the life of the life, The time is the fifth of the phenomenon and the subconscious, the lust and the anger, so the group is twelve.As for the medical forces, they are attractive, diamond, homosexuality, motivation, charlat, and developing, (P-313) and the birth, so this is seven, so the tenth of ten.When the origin of the pests was this nine tenth, the number of customers was like that, uh.And that I see that the angels are tenthly distributed on the parts of Saqr or Hell for every blessing A people from the people of infidelity, including the lower nickname that God has mentioned, the hypocrites in the lower way of the fire [Women: 145] in the surah of the women, then the disbelief is from the disbelief And the existence of God, including the one of them, and among the evil is the multiplicity of God, and among them is the worshipers of the maker Manuis, Zouziya, Al -Zanqa, and the worship of human beings, such as Malouk, and pornography, even if the one is the same God.In the remembrance of this number, it is limited to the people of the two writers, they send them on the truth of the Qur’an, as this was what he was affected Those who gave the book [Al -Muddathir: 31].The public read about nine ten years of opening the eye from (ten).Abu Jaafar (nineteen) read the eyes of the eye from (ten) to reduce the rituals of the movements, as it is the same.And there is no deeds to the denial of Abu Hatim, this is a frequency.
