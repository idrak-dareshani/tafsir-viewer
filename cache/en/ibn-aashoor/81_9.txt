Because the exile and its existence with the way of the argument that is confused with denials is the sin that is immortalized for its father and its feet, not to prove its prohibition and its sake Take a detail in it.The second: The rule of referring the verb of the cubic to God Almighty on the rule of improvement and ugliness at the disgrace, and referring them to the injustice to God, if God bless you Its deed, and it is a different origin in which the Ash'ari and the disgraced.So that God will disagree with his servants, unjust to the darkness, to them that this evidence is based on the basis of the first indication, and it is known that it is a good.The third: What he attributed to Ibn Abbas, and he refers to what Ibn Abi Hatim has been brought out in his bond to Akrama that he said: Ibn Abbas said: The sins of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in Juna The fire was lied to the words of God Almighty: And if the bouquet was asked what sins were killed and it was answered from the narrated saying about the son of the son Health, and this is a question from the principles of religion, in which only the seedlings are not satisfied.He knew that the authentic hadiths are in the ruling of the entrusted partners who are opposed, so Al -Bukhari narrated, and a Muslim on the authority of Abu Hurairah, and Ibn Abbas.The two partners, the two partners, said: God knows what they were working." And this answer takes the standing of the answer, that is: God knows that they are, as the saying of Moses - peace be upon him - his knowledge of my Lord in a book [Taha: 52] With the first centuries [Taha: 51].It is entitled to the meaning: God knows that each one of them, if he grew up, what is a factor of disbelief or faith, that is: he treats him with what he knows of his condition.(P -148) And the Bukhari, and a Muslim, was brought out - with some disagreement in the word - on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: Or they support it or make it "hadith.He increased in the narration of a Muslim, then he says - that is, Abu Hurairah -: Read the innate of God that the people fell on it, and it will not come to the creation of God, that is the religion of God.It requires that they generate the break of Islam until he enters him from his father or His closeness or his villages is what he changes from that, and this is the most insignificant in this question.Al -Mazari said in the teacher: The scholars were obliged to do so.And the hadiths, and its darkness redeemed, and the disagreement of these darkness, because of the compulsion of the scholars in that and the cutting here is here.And Abu Hurairah said: And read the innate of God that the people fell on it [Al -Rum: 30], etc.Bin Jandab is clear in this Mawloud died on the fast.And the statements of the scholars differed in the children of the participants, so Ibn al -Mubarak, Hammad ibn Salamah, and Hammad ibn Zaid, and Ishaq ibn Rahewi, and al -Shara’i: And the correct one who is the investigators and the gathering is that they are in paradise, and it is the appearance of the saying of Abu Hurairah.Al -Azraqa went to the facts that the entrepreneurs of their fathers were followed by their fathers, and Abu Ubaid said: I asked Muhammad ibn al -Hosan about the hadith of “Every Mawlid” The first of Islam before the exhibitors were revealed and before the jihad is imposed.Abu Ubaid said: As if he means that he was born on the fast, he did not inherit it because he is a Muslim while they were disbelievers, so when the dawn was imposed on that He knew that he is born on their religion.There are many sayings that are not due to a certain or a valid effect of a healthy impact.Al -Mazari mentioned that the kindness of the prophets in paradise with unanimity, and that the scholars were gathered on that the kindness of the rest of the believers in the paradise, and some of the scholars, said: The collection of those who are accustomed to the scholars of the Muslims that those who died from the children of Muslims are among the people of paradise.(P-149) The public read the killing of the first dignity.And the publication of the newspapers is his right: the folds of the newspaper, or the launch of its dryness to read its writers and present in its saying: that it is given to the newspapers: [52] Surah Al -Muddhar, and when he said: a book delivered by a publication [Al -Israa: 13] in Surah Al -Asra.What is meant: the corpus of the works, and it is either a fact that is contrary to the pastures, or a metaphor is released on the east of the eclipse of the people of the people.Once.Nafaa, Ashim, Ibn Amir, and Abu Jaafar read, and Jacob, were published by the reduction of the sheen.And the public read it by tightening the sheen for the multiplication of the frequent newspapers.And the stipulation: removing the terrorism from The dead animal, which is the best of the sake; Because the slaughter is only said in removing the terror of the cows and sheep without removing the insulting of the camels, it is a scandal and is not said to be slaughtered, and the lavish is that the intention is to be removed from the day of the day of the day.During the day of the day of resurrection, after his saying: If the souls are married, and if the bases were asked and said: If the newspapers are published.It is clear that the sky remains a defamation of an infringement, the angels come out between it and between the land of the muddles until the account is completed, so if the account is made, then the account is made.The sky is shivering and the scattered from it is the world of immortality, and it is a script of the removal of the removal.It is permissible for this to be from the events that have been made for the hour and its remembrance was delayed for the occasion of the publication of the newspapers; Because the newspapers are published by the angels, and they are the people of the sky, so this scatter is from the ritual of the chaste in its saying, the Almighty: If the sky is breathed [the split: 1] Hope: If the sky breaks out [breakfast: 1] to his saying: I knew the same thing that was presented and was late [Al -Iftar: 5], so the scorpion will be for some parts of the heaven Another, then it will be of the words of the Almighty: Do not open the doors of the sky and do not enter the paradise until the camel enters the poison of the tailor [Al -A'raf: 40] The day of the heavens, as the record of the record for the book, as we started the first creation that we return [Al-Anbiya: 104] because its appearance is a connection (P-15) It is obtained before the seventh of the resurrection and the events that fall after the mission five.And the hell is its origin: the fire is the same as the fuel from the hip and the like, some of them, and it became a flag of prevailing over the Hell of the House of the torment in the last in the place of the torment in the last.And its pricing or its prices: its mereness, that is: it was prepared for the torment of those who have the right to suffer.Nafaa read, and Ibn Dakhwan on the authority of Ibn Amir, and a disclosure of Asim, Abu Jaafar, and Ruis from Yaqoub (Sa`r) with the hardship of the eyes.And the rest of the people read it with lightness.It was made with the garden of the house of the naked, and the name of paradise is knowledge of the prevailing over the house With the closeness of their mosques, where they are not tired of them in the prayer to it, and that is a dignity for them.And I know that the bond to it in the thorny sentence is the same as the word of the word (if) from his saying: If the sun is, it is left to here, and the ritual of it is from the It can be said: If the sun is evolved and if the stars are confused, and so as he said: If the sky is inhaled, then it was like the delicacy [Rahman: 37] The perpetrator of those news that is made of signs to the day of the resurrection In order to completely fulfill his thief to fulfill it and achieve his fall.The male of that sentence is a loyalty to the exact answer after it by saying: I learned the same as it was brought.And the same is the same as the consequences of the consequences of the word.On the authority of Umar ibn al -Khattab, that he read the first of this surah, and when he reached the same thing, I did not attend, he said: For this, the story was done, that is, it is the answer You know what you are attending and know it.And his saying: A soul is a denial in the condition of the condition, which is intended by the general, meaning: every soul has learned that it was brought, and the general benefit from the denial in the rituals of the ritual The indication of the integrity of the integrity to one of the bonds, and the presidency here is a lot of (breath) in the answer One, and (P-151) said: The day you find every soul that you have done from the good and the good and what it has done of bad [Al-Imran: 30].And Al -Haddar: Make the thing present.And the meaning of the same knowledge of what was brought to the peaks of what was not the knowledge of it with the facts of the work that the knowledge of it was with a distraction: And some of it is a science that has been attached to his consequences, and some of it is forgiven.So the knowledge that was the one who had people in the life of the world was revealed by the world of knowledge, and the science has proven to them on that day, the knowledge of their eyes, for the good of the good of the good He has a knowledge of what he despises from his business and remember what he had known before, and the forgotten and forgiven remembrance of him is a kind of knowledge.And what I brought is what I have set aside from the work, and when the works were shown from the rewards and punishment of the day, then it was expressed by the appearance of its effects with the absence The migrant has the same as a boss.And it is called that numbers as the saying of the Prophet ﷺ for the one who asked him when the hour?What did you prepare for it?The brought to the souls is supported by the fact that it is the active of the hopes that appear its reward on the day.A metaphorical metaphor, a mental metaphor, and their right to say: The day you find every soul that you have done from the best of civilization and what you did from The definition of the soul was made for the parts of its works, when it was obtained by the group of the conditions that were mentioned in the thorny sentence; Because some of the conditions that are included in the conditions are compared to the fact that the science of souls with its constraints, which is the six, is the one who is removed from the last, and some of the hearts, and some of the hearts, The first six, so the nearby is the house of the comparative, so all of them were made of conditions for if.
