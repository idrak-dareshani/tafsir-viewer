The Quranic researcher (P-219) that book is the principle of words that have no connection to the Arabs with the war of pain, as you knew from what was presented to all the numbers as it is the most.The owner of the scouts has passed on to be the case of the prohibitions of the argument of the argument to the defamation of the creek of the partners, the one who comes to the one who is the same as the one who is the one who is the same.Referring to the pain of its adversity is an intended letter to the miracle, that is, that meaning that occurs from the argument, that is, that virtue of its adversity from the wage of your ware I am interested in his status, so it will be a sentence that is independent, which is marketed to abandon and the name of the sign is starting and the book.On the appearance, the signal is to the Qur’an known to them at that time.The name of the sign is starting and the book is a substitute and its informing after it.Because everything that has been descended from the Qur’an, it is the one who expresses it that it is the Qur’an, and it will join it with what is attached By deeds, the words of the book will be on this face, as it is a news of the name of the sign, and it is permissible for the reference to be to all of the Qur’an, as it has come from it and what will come from it and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it, and what will come from it.He is present in the insults, and he likened the present in the eye, so the definition in it for the custody of the possibility and the signal to it for the urbanization is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who says: Instead, or by that, and the news is in it.It is permissible to come in the same way as this in the name of the mandatory sign for the closeness and the place for the distance.Then it is correct to refer to it to the absent, so that the two are valid for the removal of the distance, because the one who is absent from him is absent, and he says that he is mentioned in the cord of the present, so he said: So I said to that man and said to this man, and so it is permissible for you in the words that are listened to a relative to refer to him with the memory of the absence and the distance as well Great, because the memorizer remained his hearing, and he became like the clouds, but the most in this sign is for the sake of the presence, so he said: This is a great oath, that is, the most of the most, that is, the most like, that is Referring to the distant and its remembrance is reduced by the present memory, and that reflects that in the sign of the saying.And the son of Malik in Al-Tasheel, between the two of the two, and the distant in the reference to the advanced words, when he said: They may be punished, that is, the name of the village and the distant of what is from what is from it.(P-220) The words, and the same as his explanation of his saying, after the story of Jesus, so we recite him from the verses and the wise male [Al -Imran: 58] Then he said that this is the right of this He pointed out once and once and once, one of which is one, and the words of a son Malik wakes up with the recovery, as he hardly conforms to what he returned from the recipients.And if it was the ruling of the signal to a cloud, it is not the same as the indication of the words in the permissibility of the two directions for the many of them, too From his Shiites, and this is his enemy [Al -Qasas: 15] If the vagina is whether the recipient is a field for the advancement of the abuse and the observance of the requirements of the conditions, and we have come They choose in the signs of the two references, which is more suitable for that place, so we indicated that they know their addresses with purposes that are not accepted, if they are not accepted, if they are not before.Whether in the origin of the language, so that the survival is for one of the two recovers, not in the sense of the likeness of the increase in the alarm in the name of the remote sign as it is here, and as it is here I say to him and the glimpse of his tenderness is a reflection of a fear that I am that and may come to the relative to show the lack of heritage as a saying of Qais ibn This death comes not to wrap a need ∗∗∗ to myself, unless I spent its spending, so it is not a crime that the sign was in the verse by seeking the name of the sign for the distance of this The Qur’an to make it after the homes.It was common in the words that are the pure matter with the pervasive thing (P-221) in the glory of the attribute, because the negative thing is my dear to the family of the people of the The rituals are a goodness for the lessons and the abundance of support and the vulnerability, so the book is here when it was mentioned in the position of the definition of the exhibitions of what is wrong with it It was like a dear thing that attains the lineage to their entry into them with the exhibitions or because it is to believe its suffering and the benefit of his guidance with a long time Like their saying, they are the first legends of the first people [Al -Anam: 25] and this is not mentioned on this, and this is a book that we have sent down [Al -Anam: 92], so he did not have a book of the book To be absent from the domination of it and preach to its sins and its provisions.Perhaps the owner of the scout was built on the same as what was built on the one who was satisfied with it, so he was no longer.That is what he said in the requirements of the definition of the supporter to him with the sign: Or to intend with his distance to his greatness, as you say in the place of the majestic and that It was said by Azz and Ola the pain [Al -Baqarah: 1] that book is back to its distance.And his saying: “The book” is permissible to be in the name of the reference to the purpose of the intention of the one who is referring to it for the number of his views, so the definition is in it for the time of the covenant, It is in it, and it is permissible for the book to be a news about the name of the sign and it will be Determination, the definition of gender, so the sentence is beneficial to the shortcomings of the book on the Qur’an due to the definition of the two parts.Al -Kamal in the sweetest of the books based on the fact that others from the books if they were attributed to it, they were like the hackers from them and described the book because of the sequences of all of them, as well as the words of the book, The grammarians are expressed in the preparation of the suffering of the mother of the knowledge in the sense of significance on the fullness, so he does not want that it is how the book is limited to the fact that it is the pain or in the surah or the one that is not.The confinement, but it is the standing of the definition, not other than, so the vagina is the definition and the indication is a backwardness, and there is nothing of that in any way, even if it is preceded by some of the things.And the book is effective in the sense of the written either the source of the justification for the exaggeration in the book, for the source comes in the sense of the act of creation, or the same Dress in the sense of a stalled and baptism in the sense of baptism in it.And his detection from the meaning of the meaning of the collection and the authority that the book is collected and its forefathers, because the prophet ﷺ is a matter of writing everything that comes down from the one who is the one who is a liking and made it The Qur’an is a book indicating his book for his memorization.And the writing of the Qur'an is the case of sufficiency on the Muslims.* * * (P-222) There is no doubt in which there is a guidance for the righteous, a state of the book or a first or a second news about what has passed.And the Lord is the doubt, the origin of the anxiety and the obligation of the soul, the Lord of time, and the Lord of the Sunnah, as well as the repentance of that.It is obligatory for the soul of the soul and its worry, the Lord is overwhelmed by the Lord, and he became a naughty fact.His Arabs are also said, as it is the gossip, it was not covered by an excessive aggressor, as it is like a right and a right His proximity is to doubt that Abu Zayd said, and on the separation between them, Bashar said: ؎ Your brother, who if his Lord said, he said, but you have given him, because he did not give it to the It provides you with "any of the verb that brings you closer to doubt in the prohibition to another verb that does not enter you with a doubt that it is permissible.The recovers of the readers did not differ in a conquest, not a rapper, in the man The indication was by saying that to the vanity of the community in the will of the will to be brought to the opponents, and it was saying: Rabb is a negation of a special Lord, and it is the Lord who is presented in the being of this book, composed of their letters as their words, so how they are for example, The denial of the snake in it was a truth and not by claiming, so you will be a sentence, not an irrigation, a house that is affirming the affirmation of the benefit of the book, and this is the saying That the pilgrim, which is his saying in which he is attached to a rib, is on the authority that it is a disagreement for a lord, so the stand on his saying is in it, and he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And the day of the group is wondering that there is no doubt in which it is [Al -Shura: 7] and his Lord said that you are the gathering of people for a day that there is no doubt in it [Al -Imran: 9] and it is permissible for him to be the saying of it He told his saying after it is a guidance for the righteous and the meaning (in) is the definition of the metaphoric, the norms of the custody of the custody of the custody, so that it will be made.For those who exposed to the Qur’an, and they said, "Do not hear for this Qur’an [Chapter: 26] to remove the birds of their alienation, as if it was said that this is the book of this book.Listen to him and that we disbelieve (P-223) guidance, that is, in which there is something of this guidance at the end of the saying of the Prophet ﷺ to my father’s virginity (“You are an ignorance of you) A deleted for his appearance, that is, there is no doubt, and the news is deleted, a lot of uses in his lords, they said, they said, there is no harm and the saying of the Arab ؎ Whoever repels its fire ∗∗∗ I am the son of Qais, and there is no comfort, that is, there is no success in that, and it is a metaphor of metaphor, so the stand on his saying is that there is no doubt and in the scout that His saying is a Lord, and if the sign is by saying that to the book by adopting his being like the present, the witnessed, and the book was said by the name of the reference to the name There is a difference in a richness attached to a rib and not a deleted way on the many ways in the same way The book on this direction denied the doubt that it is a descending of God, because the intended is the discourse of those who are in the righteousness You were in a rapper from what we descended on our servant, and they came with a wall of the like [Al -Baqarah: 23] and their clothes and a famous occurrence, but we descended from their clothes, because they are in the place If they were contemplated, their clothes would still be, then the clothes were removed with the states of its heroes, the home of the number.The conquest of the key said: They flip up the judge with the denial if it is with him as soon as you contemplate him, he will be deterred and they will say to the denial of Islam: Islam is a right and a right The Qur’an has no doubt in it, and how many of the hardships are in which it is in it (on this), so the compound is indicative of the affirmed negation of the Lord who is used By the Lord, the case of the one who is in the face of his Lord, in the case of those who are not in the first place on the style of the representation.And among the interpreters who made his saying to the Almighty, there is no doubt in it in the sense that it is not There is something that requires clothing in his health, that is, there is no obligation in it, and there is no disagreement, so the Lord is here is a metaphor in its causes, and the boundaries are a disagreement, so there is no His saying, "Do they not manage the Qur’an, and if it was from God, they would not find a lot of disagreement [Women: 82], meaning that the Qur’an does not include the words When the truth is the Lord of the two worlds, from the words that are contradicted, one or the words that are contrary to the truth and the guidance, or (P-224), commands that the evil and corruption of the brother The virtuous, and that is the abandonment of it from it, it requires that what the Qur’an is upon him if the manifestation is managed in it and its grandfather is the benefactor of the one who is from the one who is with God Let us make them intended from the origin that we originated in the ninth submission.This negation does not have a claim and does not download, as this face sings from the download of the supplies of the home of the host The books are forced their sayings and violated because of the prohibition and that is because the confirmation of the people of the exile of the Lord of the Qur’an is the one who says: With the Lord, when you include it, that is, a meter, who is based on clothes, as it is close to what they said, in which there are beautiful sayings like this, this is a magic, these are the myths of the first That it is intended to be broken, not after saying that the book, as you say to those who spoke after the people, you spoke in a jam, and you are silent: Other than him.And in this face, it is also possible to unite the meaning when standing, but whoever stands on “in it” and whoever stands on “Rabb”, because if he expressed the shadow, then he is the one who has been seen.I was able to dispense with this custody of his sentence, and the scouts mentioned that the disobedience while he said: It will be a name about a name, not as the custody was presented in his saying: “There is no infection in it” because if the custody was presented here, it is intended that it is another book in it.It means that the adherence is in the same way as it benefits the seed, so it is beneficial that the denying the Lord is short of it, and that it is otherwise from the book, and it is the one who is in it.What is here.And the confinement is not in his saying: “There is no doubt in it,” because the context is a discourse for the unjust Arabs with the Qur’an, and they are not among the people of the book.Rather, I want that they have no excuse in their denial that it is from God, as they were called to his opponents, so they miraculously.Yes, it is beneficial to be broken by the people of the book who visited the participants and encouraged them to deny it by the Qur’an that the Qur’an may be among the good There is nothing in it He is a rare of God, in which they are in which they find what is required of the clothes in it, and that is the way to admire them with their admiration for their writing.The suspicion of the truth is the pioneer of its appearance.And the dawn of the underwriting between the hands of the sun is a tree with its travel.And his words were built on the fact that the prevailing sentence is in the case of confirmation, even if he entered a denial, and it is in that way, he benefited the negligence of the negation, and the denial, and the denial, and the negligence, (P-225) The conquest is the consequence in the assessment of the chain of transmission, in which there was between what came with the evidence and what came in the negation.And when I am in it, I will remember him when he said, the Almighty, there is no guidance on you and the judgment of the movement of the destiny or its knocking in the knowledge of it.And his saying is a guidance for the righteous, the name of the source of the guidance, he has no counterpart in the language of the Arabs, except for secrets, and the crying, and the language of the source of the elimination of a lord.And his action is a guidance that exceeds the second verb to him and may exceed himself on the way of the widening of the widen Race [Al -Fatihah: 6].And the guidance of investigation is the significance that is from the matter to the prostitute, and this is the phenomenon in its meaning, because the origin is the number of synagogues, so it is not a guidance of the exalted The guidance is complete, and this is an agreement to the meaning that is transmitted to the guidance in the legal knowledge.It is the most promising of Al -Ash'ari’s promises because the success that is the receipt at Al -Ash'ari from the creation of God Almighty in the heart of the hypocrisy, so it is appropriate for the sake He who guides the legitimate guidance.The Qur’an is guided and described it as the source of the lagum, that is, it is this.The law is the guidance to what is in the urgent righteousness that does not expire.And the influence of this guidance is the duties, so those who are righteous are guided by its guidance and the stubbornness are not guided because they do not manage, and this is a meaning that is not different in it, The origin of the arrival of the deduction, and it is an issue that has no need for it in understanding the verse.And the detail of the types of guidance is presented at the saying of the Almighty, the path of the path [Al -Fatihah: 6] and a place of guidance, if it is the chest of a sentence to be a news that is a good news The book will be the meaning of the book that it is the guidance and in it from the exaggeration in the presentation of the guidance with what the news requires the source of the sign to the point of the reference to the way to the exaltation of the absence of the absence of the absence of the He was the eye of the guidance, alerting him on the risk of guiding him from what he accepted from the books, and if he stands on his saying, there is no irrigation, and the custody was the chest Beginning with his predecessor, before it, and it is a news that it is a guidance, so the custody indicates that the guidance is from it, so it is equal to that in you The significance is able to be able to present, which is the album that he has appointed guidance.(P-226) The righteous who describes the sequences is the request of the fulfillment, and the goodness of the maintenance and the preservation of the deceitful, so the fearful is the warning that is required for the survivor, What is meant here is the righteous of God, that is, those who are afraid of his anger and restored to ask for his illnesses and admire his request, then if the Qur’an is read to them, they will not be.Call to him, and they are used.And the legal piety is the compliance of the orders and the seizure of the prohibitions of the cabinets and the numbers of the embarrassment on the listening, and it is clear and inwardly, that is, the meeting of what God has made, the one who is the one who is the one who has made it.And his punishment, as all of them are all virtuous, and they do it with punishment without the pain.What is meant by guidance and from those who are righteous in the verse is the linguistic meaning, so what is meant is that the Qur’an is from the matter of communication to the good demands and that those who are used to the one who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one That is, they are those who were repeated from the perseverance and their souls for themselves from the urbanization of the imitation of those who are misleading, and they feared the punishment, and they were the same from the danger of God.What is meant by the believers who believe in God and praise be to God His saying is the highest of those who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3] to his saying before you [Al -Baqarah: 4] and in the Bayan as the one of the Qur’an is a guidance and how is the righteousness The Qur’an is guided in the time of the situation, because the description of the source is compensated by the description in the name of the subject and the time of the situation is the original in the name of the subject and the intention of the state.And the righteous are the righteous, also because the name of the actor is right in the immediate, as we said, that is, all those who went to himself and preparing it for the acceptance of the kinship are the same.This is like his saying, and those who guided them increased their guidance, and they gave them their goodness [Muhammad: 17] The second is that it is guided in the past, that is, it is given to him, that is, from what the book is from the book of The righteous of those who were pious are their slogan, that is, the guidance appeared in them, so they will fear and on it, so it will be a praise for the book with the witness of his guidance, and the blessing of those who are.Take it up.And the release of those who are righteous on the one who is piety in what is going on, and if it is not the majority in the description in the name of the subject, a launch that is bound on the Qur’an.The third is that he is guided in the future for those who will fear in the future and insist on it here, the two centuries of description in the source of the source, because the source is not.Specific.He obtained the description of the book with the source from the abundance of the suffering, if it is not, even if it was described (P-227) in the name of the subject.So it was said to the righteous, for this is a praise for the Qur’an and intending it with it and reducing it [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
