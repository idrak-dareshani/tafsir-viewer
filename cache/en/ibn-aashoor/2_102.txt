The researcher, followed by what the demons recite on the King of Solomon, and the disbelief of Solomon, but the devils disbelieves, they teach the people of magic.And his answer in his saying, and when a messenger came to them from God [Al -Baqarah: 101] the verse with a remarkable remembrance of them is a wonder, and she took them with the falsehood after the remembrance of them.For the right to the right, then this is the suitability of the kindness of this news on the one who was before it.If what is meant by the book of God is in his saying “God’s book behind their appearance [Al -Baqarah: 101]“ The Qur’an, then the meaning is that when the Messenger of God came to them as a sincere, they are not.They are held by the convergence, so they do not follow what is free of its

disbelief, and they attributed all of Silman, so the Jews said: Selman disbelieved.What is meant is from the verse with the reason for its descent, if it comes down from the reason that Solomon, peace be upon him, was when the kingdom of the family was divided after him, after his hearts, after a little The kingdom of Yahwah and her king Their whims came to their adults and in their presenter Let

did not come to their effort from the overthrow of his literary power, and that is the authority of the authority of the authority of the authority, and that They put the lies of Solomon, who will broadcast them in the general public to spend it and be bitter: one of them is the proportions of Solomon to the magic and the infidels to cut the hearing of the son of his son.The Abbasid state,

say.What is meant by the king is the time of the king or the king is due to a coccy Like their words, this is in the life of the Messenger of God or in the disagreement of Omar ibn al -Khattab and the saying of Hamid ibn Thawar: ؎ It is only in the wraps and the relationship He wants the mourners of Ibn Hammam.Likewise, the additive is deleted if the tester or the reasons are wanted by it, as you say that so and so on the disagreement of Omar or this is a book in the king of the Abbasids, and that is the one that is the one who is In an adjective or a story that is correct to release it and

after the death of his father, Dawal, And the greatness The possession of the children of Israel in his duration and he who commanded the mosque of the house of the sanctuary and was a wise and poet, and made his king His ships are rooted in a distant pace, such as a vocabulary.And his saying: (And Solomon's disbelief) is a sympathetic sentence that raised its symptoms, as I feel it, saying that the people of the people recite on the king of Solomon, from the meaning that they are the meaning of them.The disbelief, it is a disposal between the sentence of “and followed“ and between his saying ”and what was revealed to the two king “And they knew whoever he was shared by“ etc., if it is ”and what has been revealed,“ is given to magic This judgment is then from the sentence of Jews, because his fate (follow and disbelieve), and Solomon disbelieved, but he was offering the disbelieving of Salman His integrity and his deafness, and because the disbelief of his disbelief was a misguidance for those who followed what the demons have written, so he did not doubt that the ruling of the ruling and the ruling of the ritual It was a news about Jews as well.And the Jews were imitating the disbelief of Solomon in their books.And the years of his hearts to their gods, like the God of the Sidonians (and Mulbouk), the God of the Umoon (the two) and the son of his God, the God of God

extended from the characteristics of the medical things and the composition, and the Arabs were not for the Arab Their ribs were incompatible, and the Arabs were claiming that the knowledge of people with magic and the Sabeans, and they are the people of Babel, and the argument of the verse indicates that the month of this When the Arabs.And the Muslims have believed that the Jews are in the way

their appearances until they are fascinated or deceived and a backward, such as habits, except that it was popular with their general and after the sake From it, it became a phrase from the voting, the misfortune, and the absurdity of falsehood in the image of the right, or the ugly in the form of good or the harmful in the image of the beneficial.Special in the hands of the priesthood, and they are the people of the people of science from the people who are all in their self The ethics is to the generalization of the public to them and subjugate them with what they appear from the ability to treat diseases and acquires on the bronchite of the seat of the seed And with the places.Dental, Persian, and Romans.Al -Nafisi in itself, from the weakness in the same enchanting, and from the chain of transmission, the enchanting witnessed it, and it is lost.With the words of the Almighty, the magician of Farisan, the inspection of the people, and their ears.[Al -A'raf: 116].He returns to a pharaoh characteristics, such as the pelvis of the dowry, and from that obstacles influencing the minds, as a good or a corruption, and the abundance of the consecration of the consequences, and the abstracts, and the abstracts, and the abstracts, and the abstracts, and the abstracts, and the sins, Its influence was removed, and this signal is the Almighty saying in the magician of Pharaoh, but they made a warm good [Taha: 69].The speed and the wavy until the gynous imagination is destroyed.And the signal has a saying that he imagines from their magic that it is sought [Taha: 66].This is the basis of magic with the briefing, and the pride has been divided into interpretation into eight sections that do not count these three origins and some of them are interfered.And the scholars of the Ephrang are another chapter, in which there is no seriousness.These are the three origins, all of which are fascinated by the enchanted, and it is connected to it, and it has an effect on it in the capacity of the subject of its soul, and it is not the same, and it is not the same, and it is not the same, and it is not the same, and it is not.And its group is the one who referred to the verse, and it is the one who is unaware of its proof of the sentence without detailing, and the one that has been not one of the delusions and the opponent is something that does not affect it In the same way, whoever wants to magic and be absent from him, so he claims that he is affected Something sophisticated sophistications that include the impure with the crying or with the names of the demons, the gin, and the gods of the feet, as well as the writing of the name of the enchanting in Ashkal.Or the place of his pictures, or some of his clothes and upscars, and he waved it as a word to it, with the claim that it affects that in the right of the magic, or the signs of the He made him the same as his country, which they call the observation and the reminder of Abu Bakr ibn al -Arabi in the Qabas that Quraysh, when the prophet indicated that the Prophet said: Muhammad is moving away from people, or collecting appointed parts and destroying some of them with some intention that that drawing or gathering is to influence a person or a person or a person or a person Love, hatred (P-634), illness or peace, and not if it is compared to the name of the enchanting and its pictures or the severity of his birth, then the one who is all of it Its impact is a sign of the mind, nor from the nature, nor what it proves from the legs, and the evidence of the proof of the truths has been confined to this evidence, and from the wonders of the sacrifice in the misfortune He tried to prove it with what is not convincing.A group has been committed to the effects of the effect of this type of magic from what was narrated in the correct ones about “Aisha’s saying that Labid ibn al -Asim al -Nahar ﷺ That the owners of this magic, and in the women about Zayd ibn Arqq, the same is a shortened, and the installation is notified in its terms, then it is in his words, and then it is not in his words The Prophet was enforced ﷺ, and the Jews were magic in the city, and that God has brought his messenger to what he did for a good to be a miracle for the sacrifice of the Prophet.Let the Jews know that it is a foreboding that they do not suffer from, and the magic of magic has not been affected by Moses, as well The Prophet ﷺ is a bodies that God has recovered from him, so he went beyond that he was compared to what he did for Bid Bin Al -Asem from the imperfection of his magic And the vision of the Prophet ﷺ was a news from God for him with what was made by the good, and the expression of a picture of that vision was beautiful, because the opinion is a symbol and did not want to be mentioned It should not be in the first place to separate the story.Then, the effect of its causes or the three of the three of the three of them in the same magicians and some of them in the same enchanting, so it is necessary in the witch to be the stirring Cut into the use of magic, magic, and strong wills, as a few, for a few of the ancients of the testes, the name of the structure, the one who is the light And the trick, and for that the majority of magicians were a man, but the bugs made the sins of women, and so was the majority in the Persians and the Arabs, he said, and from the evil of Al -Nafat.He came with the female group, and the ignorance was saying: The Gilan is a wondrous one of the jinn is the storms, so this is the ability to form a different forms, and it was the same The goodness of their students for this science by being brought to the disagreement, and their command, by the adoption of hardships, is an estrangement to the condolences of their condolences.As for what is necessary in the enchanting, the pride of the mind, the weakness of the determination, the circumambulation of the structure, and the ignorance of the mind (P-635), and for that, the most people were affected by the people The public and whoever admires everything.Therefore, one of the origins of magic was the meeting of false sayings on the enchanted person to adopt the inck of his mind in believing in distortions and trustworthy things, and he said: They are after the death after the death, who are the ones who disbelieve, if this is nothing but a clear magic [Hood: 7], so make that the strange saying of magic.Then the magic is buried, from which the integrity, which is the same.The type of abuse from it is the strengthening of the witch in the success of his work to strengthen his determination, and his influence is accustomed to souls, and this is like this They are the servants of the curtains and their needs to use their souls and the chain of transmission with those of the aspects of the use of heaven and the strong powers so that the person is able to do so.His work, and he is presented to him with determination, and therefore a wondrous and impressive effect, and for that they are called these sayings and success He is determined if he is engraved, then if he completes the knowledge, he may be overlooked by a serious little that that condolences, and he may not be overlooked, and in both the states, he does not know.He has the end of the alert to the corruption of that, so that they will not enter the suspicion of it in his ability Their predecessors, and from this type, is in the original, a merchant for the sake of obedience to the learner for his teacher, he remained lying in them from them.Likewise, the adoption of the hidden and the insulting of the righteous and the things that are holy, to be deluded that they are informed of the paths of the demons and their cheeks, and that in the location is a disagreement for the sake The learner, because the greatest thing on the soul is a rejection of the dearest of things, which is religion, and because the magician is not from the millions, so they reach their people.He heard that many of those who eat magic in the Muslims claim that they do not have success, except after being stained with their hands.And the type of existence from it is hidden from the real reasons for their collaborators until the people do not come to their being, so they are used to reach their eyes Their heavens with the names that they are not heated, and they put them as a meant on the paper or in the grandmother, they claim that it has the characteristics of the influence, and it is a matter Significant lattice, especially the moon, and from this their appearances to people with the appearance of asceticism and gossip.And a variety that is used to the influence of magic, which is spying and reading on the hidden things and the secrets of people with the mediation (P-636) Each of them is dispensed by the secret of the other, so the witch takes those secrets and a means that the nomadic is thrown into in the hearts of its companions by manifesting it.He commands those who have elaborated them and use them with what he does, and they will be obeyed, so he commands the woman to be angry with her husband, and he asked for his dignity, His husband and such, and in this section, the ability of the witch magic appears, and with it the most freshness and dangers of the people and its domination of the people are on the authority of the people And the users by receiving the money by theft, which the person who does not accuse the stolen, and from it that he does that from his own and his sons, and his husbands, the wickedness And they make them rid of them to salvation, and the action of magicians is ended in this to the limit of the defamation of the souls who feel that it was overflowing with the sake The compliance of their orders is tempted by those who are safe from it, then the guarantees of people are broken by hidden traditions and asking that it is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is delusional that he is illuminated by it.Let him know his acceptance.And a type that makes a declaration of the sake of the trails of the deeds of the people in the virginity of its magic, and that is by putting the things in the feeding of the fear of the time to see it to see it.Put them, and by the highness of fantasies or phases in which the view is deluded by the view that it is a gin, demons or signs, and it is nothing but a decay or the agents of its agents.What the magician has told about it, or does it require the revelation of its truth or the exclusion of its effect.The magic was a pocket of the same joke, the corruption People, for the sake of that, did not have the right to warn people from it and prepare it to be preoccupied with the obedience of God Almighty; Because it is built on the effect of the influence of the gods and the heaven who are forgotten to the gods in the leaders of the old, and Moses warned his people from the magic and the magic of the magic Correct 18 that what he addressed is Moses, peace be upon him, “When did you enter the earth that gives you the Lord your God, do not learn to do the like In you who permits his son or his daughter in the fire, nor who knows a naughty, a nose, nor a optimistic, nor a wizard, nor the one who promotes a telegram, nor who asks for a jinn or a good.Al -Tawara made the wilderness of the magic, in the travel of the two, the two chapters 20-27 “and if it is in a man or a woman of Jean or a follower, then he is killed.” (P-637) And they mentioned about Malik that he said: The names that magic writes in the compassion are the names of idols.Islam has warned against the work of magic and its defamation in the positions, and that is not the requirement of proof And the elderly of the religion and the frightening of the ethical.And the scholars of Islam have fallen aside in proving the reality of magic and its denial, and it is disagreeing in the circumstances, as I see it.Ayad narrated that the knowledge of the knowledge of the Sunnah of the Sunnah, they went to prove his truth.I said: And in their words, and the description of the magic, which has proven its truth, then it has proven it over the sentence.And the general public went to the fact that the magic is not a right to it, but it is its identity and imagination and that it is a beating of lightness and the poetry, and he agreed to that of the Sunnah of the Sunnah The story of Ayad was stated in Al -Ikkal, I said: And whoever called Abu Isaac Al -Atrabadi from the Shafi’i.And the question, with its rituals, is one of the issues of the jurisprudence, it enters into the punishment of the people, the killers, and the consequences of the money, and do not enter into the origins of the debt.It is, even if it is denied by the city, it is not necessary for his denial to be a union.This verse is unhappy.As for the hadith, I taught it nose.The jurisprudence stressed the aging in its use.Malik said: The magician is killed and is not received if he is a Muslim, and if he is a dhimma, he is not killed, but is disciplined unless he enters his magic, adding to a Muslim, then he is killed; Because it is a contradiction to the covenant, because it is the term of the covenant that they do not expose the Muslims to harm, Al -Baji said in the seller: He saw that your money is the magic of the magic, And when his friend was hidden with his verb, he is like a hein for the sake of the purification of Islam and the infidelity of the disbelief, and that is the son of Abd al -Hakam and Ibn al -Mawaz Like a tingling if the magic is not It is followed, and if it appears, it is an interpretation, and it is an interpretation of the saying of your money, there is no disagreement for him.He said: He will reveal that who knows his truth and proves that at the imam.In the sufficient of Ibn Abd al -Barr, if the magic is done for the sake of killing and killed him, he was killed, and if he was not unbelievers, and he entered your money in the Magic Al -Arabi in Al -Qabas: The face of that is that the enchanting does not know the work of magic until it falls into it, I said: I do not doubt that the magic, which was made, was made by the murder of the murder The wickedness of it, or with it, the wake of the souls, and that, that the magician was preparing for those who brought it to the magic by that so that the night dies, tomorrow, or it will be in the way The receipt of (P-638) is a hidden poison from the drugs to the enchanting, which is received in the food by the medium of people from the people of the enchanting, so the enchanted person becomes a dead or a person, so it is dead or the mind.Malik is intended that his penalty killing, that is, if he is killed, and that he said: Do not accept his repentance, and the beginning of this state is not valid in his jurisprudence, this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is correct.The magic is not a caller of a specific evidence in the magic of the magic, but it is from the door of achieving the restrictions with the effect of the barriers of pride and harm, and for the sake This question is a wondrous latter, which is made by their proverbs, that magic is more required for the sake of the sake of the lover of the loved ones, and they are in love Lenza, or for the righteousness of love or husband.Malik was asked to those who hold the men from the women, and about the neighbor who feeds a man something, and his mind goes, and he said: They do not kill, so what is the one The neighbor has come a great matter, which was said to be killed?He said: No, Ibn Rashd said in Al -Bayyan: He saw that her action is not from magic, uh.Abu Hanifa said: A man is killed and not received.Its endeavor in the land of corruption.And on the authority of Sheikh Abi Mansour that the saying that magic is an infidel on the launch, but it is obligatory to search for his truth Otherwise, no, and there is no disbelief in which the soul of the soul is in the ruling of the ritual of the way, and it is equal to the male and the females, and it is accepted, and it will be accepted, and it is not acceptable, Mix, and the magicians of Pharaoen accepted their repentance.This is a cultivation by law before us.Al -Shafi’i said that the magician asks about his magic, for if he appears from him what is disbelief, then he is like a ward Those legends or smoke The medicine and the knowledge that it does a forbidden, and its ruling is the ruling of the crocodiles, so if it is recognized by the magic of a person and that its magic is killed by the majority of killing, if he kills me.With his reason, and if he said that magic may kill and may not kill, then it is like a pillar, and if his magic is for other than killing, then he dies from him, so he kills a mistake, so he made a mistake.In his money.And it is obligatory to save from their disagreement and from the separation of their words in which there is insight in it to perform the work of what is called magic and its owner with the crimes And the amount of what it influenced from (P-639) is the one who is not worse, and the name of the magician may be called the day on the players with the raid It is a result of this.* * * And what was revealed to the owners with the door of Harbot and Marut and what we know from one of the people until we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve that it is not a matter The king of Soliman, that is, and what the demons recite on what was revealed to the owners, and what is meant by what was descended from the magic, but it is a magic of the magic And the knowledge of the subjugation to the other is known to the religion with the religion and the harm to the people, as it indicated a nose, so it will be a kind of kindness on the " He was overwhelmed by “what was revealed” to him; Because it is more severe than it is more than what the devils who were taught by people with the magic that is placed from them, so the kindness is to seek the absence The origin of the magic is a slanderer from what appeared in Babel in the time of these two teachers, and the most intense of something on itself by adopting the absence of the concept, and the ritual of the concept, Like the saying of the poet (which is one of the gravity of the grammar): ؎ To the king, the Crime and Ibn al -Hayd, and it is the vertebra in al -Muzdahim, and it is said that I want the magic of the magic of the one who is the most hidden from the one Solomon's covenant because the end of what was described by this, who appeared in Babel in the time of these two teachers, that he separates the woman, and he is a woman.And the frequent readers of the “royal” by opening the owners of the owners and read it by Ibn Abbas, al -Dahhak and al -Hasan and Ibn Abazi with the fracture of the lam.And all his faces requires the evidence that we will go to the owners of the owners, and that is the one who means the context of the verse, if you separate how the knowledge Magic.The face is that his saying “and what was revealed” is kind to “the king of Solomon”, so it is a work to recite the one who is in the sense that you lie, so that the intention is what is meant.The devils lying to him for what was revealed to the owners with the door, that is, they are attributed to some magic to what was revealed in the door.The pride said, which is the choice of my father (P-640), a Muslim 55, and that the father of a Muslim denied that the magic is descending from the owners, as the command of God is not permissible, and how is it The angels take care of his knowledge with the disbelief or immorality, and it was said that there is no negligence of the kindness on (what is disbelieved in Soliman), that is, and the disbelief of Sulaiman is the same as the magic.They put it, and the magic is not revealed to the owners with a door.The owners of the owners of the purpose of the spectrum, or it is the definition of the covenant that the place will be two dignitaries, but those who know the story of the appearance of the magic, and the one who said: Threes, and that the intended of the two devils is the two of the magicians, who are Harut and Marut on the fact that it is the release of the collection on the one as the saying of it.He made a mistake, as his saying becomes “on the owners” as a filling.And on the appearance of this verse, there is a form of four faces: one of them: the color of the magic is descending.Two owners of the angels on the frequent readings, the third: How can the place between their saying (we are a temptation) and their saying (not) The intention of the temptation with the warning of the fall in it.The four: How to confine their condition in Al -Tawasaf that they are tempting, so what is the rule in their confirmation of that?Because if they are owners, the forms are back, and if they are owned by the broken lame, then they have learned that the infidelity is with the evidence of them, and it is not aware of it, They said (but we are a temptation), so why do they exist in this case?And the payment of this forms in its conclusion is that the landing is the receipt, which is if it exceeded a sign of a receipt from a high The barrier and in the sense of deposit in the mind, or in the creation that the place would have been raised in this magic and removed from it the methods of it that did not precede them from the knowledge of it The one who is developed in his knowledge of the faces of the questions, their illness, their visits, and its branches, and the most promising that it is not intended to drop the landing of the magic, for the magic, for the magic, for the magic, for the magic, for the magic, for the magic, for the magic, for the magic is from the magic Before, but the matter is to be removed from the king, or the removal of the life or the barrier of the kingdom With his knowledge, he will pay the first and second vagins.Then the wisdom of the intention of his knowledge is that the magic in Babbal was taking the magic and a means of a way to mug the public for them in their eternity and their minds, and their minds, and their minds, From it to the founding of the worship of idols and the crocodiles, and they claimed that they - that is, magic - are abandoned by them and they are dedicated to the will of the gods, and a great corruption occurred, and a great corruption.God is accustomed to his ruling to save the creation from that, and he sent (P-641), or I revealed, or if you are Harbot and Marut, to reveal the rituals of this art to the people of the people.All of them are in that, so they know that the magician is not on that and returns people to the suitability of the situation, so the third face pushed.As for the four -way face, he will know his payment at the interpretation of his saying and what we know of one of the verse.And in the readers of Ibn Abbas and Al -Hassan (the owners) by breaking the mother, which is the authenticity of the meaning of the meaning.And on the readings of the lame, the appearance in its interpretation is that it is a slogan, and that they were a righteous man who was the rule of the city of Babbal, and they had been informed of the sacrifice of the magic.The magician is in the door or they put its origin, and there was no disbelief in it, so the people entered the infidelity after that.It was said that they are the place of God, the exalted to form for people that the magic teach them to reveal the secrets of the magic They mocked the public to them, so God wanted to lie to them from the denomination of the prophecy, so he was revealed to Holly.I may answer that the magic learned in the time of Harbot and Marot is an evangelist on the side of the sake of God for his creation, for the good does not learn it and the wander The general saying of him “teach people” they said: As God, the people of Talo, are etc.And with a valuable country of the cities of the world and the origin of the name in the Global language, the chapter of Ilu, meaning the chapter of God, and its burial with the crossing is the door It is sealed by the heads, and its position is closer to the location of the country of solution now on the dimension of miles from the pivots of the heads and the tip.It was one of the greatest cities of the world, the first of which is the first of the children after the flood, while it is said, then it is followed by it.The third of the children of Noah, but the greatness of Babbal was in the age of 3755 three thousand and five and five and five before the Christ, so it was one of the chains The kingdoms of the Classeans, which are the greatest and most famous of them, and the blaming of the two countries, the two countries, and the Assyrians, were not paid to the end of this The wonders of the sons and the houses, and the subordinate of the dilemma and the wonders of magic, and they have attributed to them the valleys of the fearful wine and the magic.The days of boyhood are what it makes ∗∗∗ and do the verb of the righteous Babylonian and the dispersal of Babel at the old nations of the nations of the magic, as we came in the way of the sacrifice of the magic The connector, his saying, was revealed to the owners with a sign of a story that they know.And Harbot and Marott are a replacement of the owners, who are the two countries.The Arab weighs, and the most prestigious that Harbot is Arab (Haruka), which is the name of the moon with the Classes and that Marut is Arab The car is one of the sacred idols that are without the gods, especially the moon, for it is the most influential of the crimes when they are in this world, which is the symbol of the female, and the female is the one who is the female.The seven holes were with them, and perhaps the symbolism of the male was as it was, as it was the case with the Knanis.It is known that the chain of transmission of this dignity is caused by their beliefs that they were among the righteous who were sanctified and that they were after their death in their death.The curtains, so they (Haruka and Maraudakh) were from the feet of their scholars and their righteousness and those who are in the country and they are the one who put the magic and perhaps this is the face of the With the owners of the conquest of the mother, and the people of the stories here are a kraic story from the places of Jew Attiyah and Al -Baidawi, and the investigators, like the good and the pride, and the son of Kathir, and al -Qarbi and Ibn Aarfa to its lie, and that it is from the merits of the core of it, Those who are in the hadith, they attributed their narrations about the Prophet ﷺ or from some companions with the chain ofrs A chain of transmission to the Prophet ﷺ and perhaps it is a mosque on the imam, Ahmad, or that he has deceived it in it, the state of its states, with the fact that it is in Moses ibn Jabir, and it is a darkening of it The wise that the narration is correct, except that the narrator is returned to the news of the Jews, so it is invalid (P-643) in itself and its narrators are sincere in what they narrated, and this is the excuse It was attributed to the Prophet ﷺ Ibn Arafa said in his interpretation, and the fragrance was mistakenly, the son of Attiyah in this place for the sake of the remembrance of the story, On the authority of Al -Qarrafi, the Malik, may God have mercy on him, denied that in the right of Harut and Marut.And his saying and what we know of one of the state of Harut and Marott, and what is navigated, and expressing the harms of the story of the situation indicating that their saying is for the sake of the magic A comparative saying, according to the learning, is not delayed.And it was known from this that they were teachers and folded that to seek help from it with the guarantee of his sentences, so it is a summary of the deletion, or it is from the tan of the rhetoric.And his saying, “We are the temptation of the temptation.” There is no system, and it may be devoted and permitted according to what is added to it or according to the shrine, it is said that the temptation of money and the temptation of religion are said.And when this is The situation is different from the stability of the people in it, according to the disagreement of their minds, their patience, and their ability to do the good of the people of it, and it was from the bonds of it.That is one of the suffering that it is a lot of temptation, and therefore some of the scholars of the language will forgive.Gibbed or silver, if they dissolve them with the fire, to distinguish the righteous from the good, and this release is if it is not born, then the meaning of the perception is not in the opinion of it.Rather, the perspective is the dissolution of the obligatory and the one who has called the Qur’an, Harut and Marut, a temptation, and he said that those who have believed the believers and the believers: The Satan [Al -A'raf: 27] and the news about themselves is that they are a news of a news about the source of the lagum, and the exaggeration has confirmed that the addition of the additional, and the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the addition That there is nothing in their knowledge, and that it is a pure temptation, and it is worse from God for His worshipers in the destruction of their touch, but it is for them, He learned from them, he did it.Do not disbelieve as the magic is disbelieved when they attributed the effects of the gods and you have learned its secret.In this, what weakens is that the intended one of their teaching people is the magic to show off the lying of magicians who have attributed themselves to the loudness or the prophecy.And that appears in the interpretation of this sentence that their saying “we are a temptation” is a claim that is a claim to the lame, so they made a lot To teach him with a house that is besieged in the temptation, and the face (P-644) is their start for those who teach him with this sentence that this is the same It appears as if it is a temptation and a horny, so he is about to disbelieve his learner at a surprise that is the one who is the same as if it is his soul, it has been seen.The pharaoh of customs is a knowledge of those who show it, and their saying is “do not disbelieve”, that is, do not hurry with the intention of that in us, for you, if you are in the time The reason for the threat of spontaneity or the characteristics of things is, so the temptation gets to those who learn the magic when he sees his darkness and miracle of the sake The principle of advertising, then if it is achieved in his knowledge, the temptation is paid, then the meaning of their saying is “Do not disbelieve” with a hole, so do not be a domesticated, so do not be a domesticate, so do not The lighter advanced.* * * Then they learn from them what they separate from them among the woman and his husband and what they are in the harm of one of them except with the permission of God and they learn what is harmful to them and does not benefit them His saying and what we know from one of the necessity that the learning is obtained, and they learn, and the guarantee is in and they learn A return to one of the location in the way of the negation is an entry into (from) the exhaustion in its saying, “And what we know of one” is in the sense of every one, so it is a whole.His saying is what they separate between the woman and his wife is a sign of parts of the magic parties, which is the most effective effect, as it is separated from the difference between it The asset of a deed and a mercy, he said, and from his verses that he created for you from yourself, to live up to her, and make it between you a deed and mercy [21] Great, which is the support of friendship, brotherhood, and their disagreement: the mercy and one of it is an asset, including the father and the children, so what you thought is the preference of the matter of the matter, and it was the same as the one who gathered the command of the matter.By making God, he is in the mostqiqaat of vengeance, and he was referring to this meaning, our generous Sheikh, the peace of the father of an irritable man in his saying, and he made it between you and the mercy of this It will be either with the use of spoils for the mind of one of the youngsters until he hates his husband, or with the meeting of the tricks, the voters, and the dignity.He said it and what they are in the harm of one of God, except with the permission of God, a senior sentence.And Zaydir is a hand to one of his saying, “And what we know of one” is because of his fall in the context of the negation, so every one of the learners is known to him This is a warning that the magic does not affect him in itself, but it is different (P-645), the effect of his life with the disagreement of the suspicion, and that is the vigor, and that is the one.A lot that the verse is completely completed with the discretion from his saying: except with the permission of God, that is, God makes the causes of the capable of the effect of the magic in some of the rituals of this For the state of the Muslims who are directed to them, the words are because they created the greatness of God Almighty and His ability, and the denomination is the denomination The heroes are that the magic is a subjective condition and the barriers of other than the one who is destroyed, so it is in its saying with the permission of God to the courage.The origin of the ears in the language is the perpetrator of the verb, and the permission of the ear in the verb or in the entry of the house and the Qur’an has used it in the sense of the time The supernatural for the return, we have the saying of it and the exemption of the abundance and the pears with my permission [Al -Ma’idah: 110] or with the reasons for the reasons that are deposited in the things and the powers, such as the words With the permission of God [Al -Imran: 166], then he said it and what they are in his harms from one of the permission of God, that is, except for what God has prepared in the virginity The influence is created in his owner, so he is with the permission of God and his will, such as the one who was desired, and he returns to the endowment of what is used in it.The tribe and his counterpart are the word of the matter in his saying, the Almighty has punished between his hands and from his successor, they keep him from the command of God [Al -Raad: 11] Its people have been added to people, and this recovery has been installed in the legs of the legs until it became a normal realistic in the sense of will and will, so we will be able to do so Those who speak between its signs, which are satisfaction, love, matter, will and will.It is not the meaning that magic has been harmful and may not harm but the meaning that it is not harmful from it except what the delivery of things is harmful to its pride and its saying, and it is not possible for them to do.People harm another harm, other than the separation between the woman and his husband, and a guarantee is harmful to them.Except for harm, that is, in the world, the witch does not seek a magic to become smart after it was a slave or to make a richness after the poverty, and this is the increase Those who are interested in it, which is the intention of the verse and with this interpretation, the compassion of its saying will not benefit them, and they do not benefit them.They are in the last, and his saying will be said, Against it, as if it was said: They learn what is only harmful as the saying of the heavens and Abd al-Malik ibn Abd al-Rahim al-Harithi: P-646) Displacements are our souls, and they are not the same, and they are notified and adjusted from the palace formula for the advanced joke, and it is an alert that it is harmful.And the return of the verb they learn with the letter of compassion for the sake of the chapter that was separated by the opposite sentence.* * * And they have learned from those who have been discussed in the hereafter, and the misery of what they have made for them Follow all of that, and they have learned, etc.And the blame for you, they may know that the division of the division is the pain that is from her to enter the answer of the oath to link it to the division, then the division, then the division is omitted Expressing the answer to the answer to the consequences; Because there is no answer with an answer.It is permissible for you to be the mother of the appetite, and it is a mother that benefits the affirmation of the division and its entry into the chest It is good for the division and there is no division in it, for it is the word of the oath, and a poetry in the speeches is that the speaker is not kept on the one who was more than the more, as it was more.Remembering that one of it is in the affirmation of the nental sentence, the most reluctance of the collection between it and between the mother of the appetite; Because they are a sure tool.Al -Ridi said that the parts of the division of the division in the view of the public are all the blame.And the keffians do not prove the mother of the appetite and carry it in the sense of the deleted oath, and the dispute in this is close.And the imam in his saying, “Whoever shares it,” is permissible, as it is a division, as well as affirming the knowledge Come on.And the belief is the acquisition of something with a misfortune other than it, so the meaning is that they acquired it with the misfortune of their faith, expressing it when it comes to its saying.Creative luck is especially.In the hadith (“but this is not a creativity” (Al -Baath bin Hareth said: ؎ I was smiled, and if I approached a day with a creative, my religion, and I did not see the ritual With the affirmation of the negation of the expulsion, there is an indication that you use this magic.All (P-647) has been a luck of goodness, because the evil is good, because the evil is good, and it is the condition of the vicinity, and we have given it the virtues, or without it.They did not see them with themselves, "and they have learned about the creation of the news and" they were evil "in the sense: they sold in the sense of their words, and he said:" The soul of the soul is the reason for it in the loss and the rituals.The knowledge that is proven to them in his saying “and they have taught them” except that those who taught him is that the repetition of magic And in it, they are ignorant of them, as they knew that his owner has no creation for him, and they did not guided until the denial of the creation is necessary for the loss, as the truth is only for the sake of the righteousness, and this is the truth.They know, “his saying is his saying, and the misery of what they have made them breathed, so he referred to it that it is a sign of its effect A single knowledge is based on the fact that the knowledge is that there is no creation for the owner of the magic.The one who carries the verse.In their knowledge as someone who does not know about their work with them, the knowledge of the knowledge of them is for them, so that they will be in order With the exile, it is the knowledge of what they use from the sentence of magic from it, as if they taught the magic of the magic, and they did not know.From him, as they said: The jurisprudence knows the pride of the measurement, the judge, the Mufti, who knows that it is young, and that the jurisprudence is like the two hands, the judge, the judge, and the Mufti is like the doctor, and this is the one.The third: that what is meant, “if they knew” what he followed from the torment in the hereafter, that is, they thought that the vastness of the dispute does not have torture, and this is a relative.The lord: that what is meant by the exile science is thinking and from the stabilizer the strange knowledge, and this is a very far side, as it is not possible for them to be the knowledge of the knowledge that the knowledge is not.A strange science, so if the science was said to be a conflict science.And in the collection between you, they knew, even if they knew a strange nature.(P-648) And there is another answer based on the disagreement of the hostility of the guarantee of “knew” and my destiny “If they knew,” then the guarantee of “they have learned” They knew magic and Adamra, “If they knew,” they went back to the human being who learned the magic and walked with them himself.The knowledge was proven to them, other than the exile.
