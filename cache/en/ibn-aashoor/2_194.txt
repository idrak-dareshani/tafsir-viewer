The Quranic researcher (P-2110) The month of the month of the month of the forbidden and the sanctuary is divided.It was taught, and it was separated from its ways; Because it is a bayyan navigational; For when he explained the intention of the place, and the mosque was brought out in a special case, the poisoned was where he wages as long as it is the boundary, which is the righteousness, which is the righteousness, which is the ritual The barrier of fighting is signed.If this is a legitimacy, descending on a heavy, then it is a continuation and a separation of what the need calls to his two in this important place, and if it is descending on the authority of the one who said: In the year of the case, when they intended the Mecca in Dhu al -Qaddah, a year seven years old, they were not afraid of the partners that the partners do not fulfill the entry of the Mecca, or that they will be made.By fighting before the entry of Mecca while they are in a forbidden month, then if they are deprived of themselves, they violated the prohibition of the month, so this is the verse, or what is from the verse, or what is the one who is the good, or what is the good, They said to the Prophet ﷺ when the Umrah of the cause is built: You ended up, Muhammad He said: Yes, and they wanted to fight it, and this verse was revealed; That is, if you are in the forbidden month, then fight them; That is, God permitted them to fight the defense, so the release of the month here is a guarantee of added - and the sacrifice of appreciation from the place and from its description of the forbidden, and the estimation of the sacrament, The month was noted on this direction other than what is intended to be prepared, but to repeat it by adopting the disagreement of the heroes of its prohibition; That is, their sanctity is destroyed, it is justified for you to be forbidden.It was said: The meaning of his saying: The month of the forbidden month is that a Quraysh has repelled them from the house in the year of the Hadaybiyyah for the year, and God is pleased with the year of the year.And he said to them: This is the month in which you entered into a way for what you have repeated in it, and this was transferred from Ibn Abbas and Qutdah and the laughter of you, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the son of Abbas “A day on a day and a war is a debate.” And what is the saying of the month of the month of the month of murmurs; Like their saying: Saada with a radio, and there is no month, but what is meant is the forbidden of them and from you, and they are they.(P-211) And the definition in the month is here in the two people, it is permissible for the purpose of the spectrum, which is the appearance; Because it benefits a general judgment, and it includes every special month of the most famous of the most deprived of the costume of the one who is intended for the month of Umrah of the judgment, and it is permissible to be The intended is the month of Umrah, and the most deprived is four: Three followers are the one who is the quarrel and the pilgrimage and the forbidden, and its prohibition is for the sake And performance, and one month of unique is a rough, and in the ignorance a month of ignorance Umrah has been forbidden all of them, and for that it is said to him: a wretched righteous, and I have indicated to it in his saying: And the meaning of its color is a penalty; That is, similar in reward and equality, whoever violates it with a manna in which the reward of his crime is punished, and that God made the forbidden for the sake of the sake of the sake One is to take an offspring to the treachery of security or the harm to it, so the other is defense of itself; Because the sanctity of people is presented to the prohibition of the Azaminah, and that is the prohibition of the place as it is presented in the saying of the Almighty: and do not fight them with the mosques of the mosques.[Al -Baqarah: 191], and the news about the sanctities of the word (Qasas) is a news of the source of the exaggeration.And his saying: Whoever is accustomed to you, and they are used to him, separating him from his saying: The deprivation is divided and resort to him, and this is the face of the saying of the scouts: The promotion is a problem with problems on the part of what has been presented in his saying: There is no aggression except on the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 193] and his saying: in the same way Al -Muqdar and in the cases, as its formation in the month of the forbidden country.And his saying: And fear God with a meeting with a meeting place in the interest; That is, the limit will not be counted; Because the righteous thing is that it is an angry, it is the suspicion of excess.And his saying: Know that God is with the righteous, the words of the word “know” is marked by what he said, what he says, for if he said in the rhetoric: He will be received for the addressee, and the simplicity of the words (P-2212) will come in it when he said: “And know that God turns between the woman and his heart [Al-Anfal: 24] A metaphor in the promise of victory and the fullness, and it is permissible for the meaning to be: and fear God in His forbidden things other than the conditions His care.
