The Quranic researcher, you only create God, that God was a wise knowledge of what was seated by their choice, the path of the pleasure of God with their will, he followed him with the ritual of the ritual To be satisfied with his satisfaction with the confusion of the paths of goodness for them, because if they were from him in the place of contentment and care, they will be kind to them, and they will be pleased with them.The lusts are left, the loudspeakers said, “We will facilitate it for the family [Al -Nayl: 7]) If they do not seek to the pleasure of their Lord, and all of them are to the conditions With them with his mourning tasks, as they are wifted with the reasons for misguidance with the stability of their mountains from the rituals of desires and impulsivity with the disadvantages of the misfortunes (So ​​we will make it easier for the Asri [Al -Layl: 10]), that is, we leave it and its affairs, so it is easy for him, that is, it is attached to it without a cost.A sentence (and you only follow God) is permissible to be kind to a sentence (whoever wants to take to his Lord a path [man: 29]) or a state of (whoever is omitted) And bell.The effect of the effect of the generalization is deleted to benefit the general, and the ability: and what you are creating something or (P-413) will and the general people who are obligated to the generalities of the state A time or in any case.The reason for the crops of their will will be done with the will of God, that God is a wise knowledge, that is, knowledge of the good things to find the will of the good, the good is the good It is informed of the knowledge of its rituals in the minds of the people, because it is up to you with high disciplines that do not reach the people who reach the way to the view of it The deduction of its effects and the zakat of themselves to deny symptoms from being managed in it.And (what) is navigator, and the discretion is one of the general things of the things, their conditions, and their aspirations, and since the tool of the discretion is a source of the source of the source, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, The thing of God in the sense of his will, and it is righteous for the advertisement of the source of the export and for the abandonment of the situation, and for the adoption of time, because the source is good for the will of the three of the three.An added value was the meaning: except the state of the will of God, or unless his will is, and if an added is not appreciated, the meaning is: there is no will for you in the truth, except for the sake of the right.And the ritual arrogance (that) the source of the miracle of the Qur’an.It is permissible for you to be action and (God bless) two homes, the obligatory Conscious and be the discretion, that is, and what will you will have in a state of conditions, except in the event of the will of God.In all this, a sign of the accuracy of the will of the servant is the direction of the will of God, which is the meaning The one who gathered Al -Ash'ari crossed it by the gain, so he said in it, “More than the earnings of Al -Ash'ari”.In the verse, people alerted him to this hidden meaning to throw it in themselves, and they find its effects indicating it, and it is a wound, and for this, and this is the same Witched by the tuning of his saying (God was a wise knowledge), so it is a dissent or an illusion of a sentence (he enters whoever is in the mercy of God) And the rule is the knowledge of it, so whoever wants to enter it in his mercy and whoever wants it to be from it.(P-414) This is a sofa, and it is not like it in the words of the Almighty in Surah Abbas (not that this is a reminder, so whoever wants to mention it) because the remembrance of the remembrance of the remembrance of the remembrance of the remembrance) And I can do with it the transit of the path connected to God Almighty, so this was the same as the care and the burden of what is clear of the way to the way.And the verb (was) indicates that he described it with the knowledge of knowledge and wisdom and a self -description because they were cherished for him.It has been obtained from the chest of this verse and its end.For the collection between the opponents of the Quranic verses, which is in itself with the rituals of the waters of the servants, the waters of worship and their punishment and their punishment, and their punishment for the sake For themselves, and the other one is the things of God in the acts of His worshipers.As for the will of worshipers, if it gets a preacher with the failure of the souls of the act of desire and the end, and the will of God is the rituals of God The divine will that if you get the will of the servant, we know that God wills for His servant, and those effects are the group of things that are So you will get the waters of the servant.Those effects are what is in the system of the world and humanity of the effects of God Almighty and its creation from the effect of time and place, the formation of creation and the installation of the body and the mind, The community, the environment, the preacher, and the recitation of all of that, are overwhelmed by all of that, from all injuries or error, so if the reasons for the acceptance of the guidance are required of the gossip of the gossip of the gossip of the gossip of the gossip of the gossip of Some of it with one or the most likely it is better for her to know the will of God, because these are the effects of his will from the group of the world, and that the world is the world So, he did his knowledge by provoking it with the effects of his system in creation, which is the meaning of his will, and if it is opposite and contradicts it with some of it, and it is not a good way Its evil is more likely to be on the best of the individual from the people, and the prayer of goodness is disrupted to himself, so he did not see it, and he knew that God did not God is aware of what was driven by that individual, so that The meaning is that God did not have good for him, or with another expression that he wanted him to create evil, and there is no summary of the servant of this patch, unless he is a person, and if he is the one who is He formed a naughty if those of those who are entered in (P-415) is a barefoot of the servants and the conditions that changed their conditions and their effects were turned to the head of the After that it was a corruption of corruption, then it was a new condition, contrary to what he was barefred by it, such as what happened to Umar ibn al -Khattab And he was tempted by him in it when he was slaughtered with the dyeing of delusion and stubbornness.Likewise, this is an honor from God for the servant and a care for Him, By people from evil to good, as the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Oh God, the best of Islam in one of the two ages.” The call of the prophet ﷺ the mentioned and entered into Islam, after the saying of the Prophet ﷺ to him.ﷺ It was a trace of the call of Ibrahim - peace be upon him - with his saying (our Lord and the sack of them as a messenger of them [Al -Baqarah: 129]) The verse said the Prophet ﷺ “I pray.” This is what I have been able to do with these two things, according to the deduction, and perhaps in that what is explained by the saying of Sheikh Abi Al -Hassan Al -Ash'ari in the meaning of the sake of the sake And machines.With this, the hero of the Gabriya is the one that the verse has proven the will of the people and made the will of God a condition in it, because the condemnation is in the power of the condition His will is not.As for the disgrace of the dismay, it is a distance from the words of Al -Ash'ari except in the phrase with creation or by the loss, and the phrase of Ash'ari, the righteous, the righteousness of the Otherwise, in the realization of the meaning of the will of God, and the difference between it and between the matter or the difference of difference and detailing it in the science of speech.Nafaa, Asaim, Hamza, Al -Kisaei, and Jacob, and what you follow) read the winter of the speech on the fools from the abolition The absent domesticated to (whoever wants).
