The Quranic researcher (P-388) (P-389) (P-390) (P-391) (P-392) (P-393) (P-394) (P-395).Creation of the first human beings to the story of the creation of the heavens and the earth, in which they are transferred in the reference to the fact that God is one and on the heroes of their evil, and the one who is glorified by the remembrance The creation of the type that is the authority of the earth and the one who is shrouded in its conditions, to collect among the multiple evidence and between the different forming of the worlds and the origin of the one who knows the peace The people of the book from the knowledge that they were boasting about the Arabs, which is in the travel of the formation of the teeth.And he knows that the sequence of the indicative of the creation of Adam on Al -Haddani is that the creation of the origin of the species is a matter of freshness, because every human being if it is a person to the time He knew that it is a prestigious existence with the existence of the origin of it for him, with what is witnessed by the creation of the children from the fathers, so it is said that this nods are originally in the first place.The crossing is created in all the earth, in which it was intended to be from it, and it is the saying of you that it is necessary that the creation of what is in the land is for their sake The origin of the people who created the earth for the sake of them to surround what is in the evidence of the ability with the greatness The impact and the from the condemnation of God in the earth, so the creation of our origin was the creator of the back of our life, which is the origin of the creation of what is in the land for us, so the time was in the right to the right.Separate with the goodness of disagreement to his remembrance, his wondrous told him, so the revenue of Wow is the compassion here for the sake of the emergence of this story in the same time.(P-396) and (as) is one of the dignitaries of time, which indicates a time of a past, in which another proportional proportional is a past, so it is (when) Original - and it is the indication of the fears, and that is the one that is with all the circumstance On the rest of the Azaminah, then I have been added to the sentence, and it is more in the words to be it.It is in it, and it may come out (as) from the monument on the jurisprudence to the acting as the names of the time that is shrouded in what he went to the owner of the owner A disagreement for the appearance of the words of the gathering, it is a vague, vague, disgraceful, and the name of a time will be added to it, so the day is a time, so it is a good time, so it is a time Its reminder is a way to delete the added sentence to it, and that (as) is a mandate for the addition, then if it is deleted, it is the knowledge of the Samaid, then it is that it is that it is that it is.They delete A sentence with the name of a time (when), they feared that the smile would not be guided by something that is deleted until his evidence is required, and they will be made.Let them pay the smile, and the deleted indication of the deleted.It is in this verse that it is permissible to be a cure, as well as its generous Arabization and made it attached to his saying, they said, and it is necessary until it is the story of the story The angels, and that is far because the intended of the lesson is the speech of God to them, and it is the principle of the lesson The types of people who are the stomachs of the lesson from his saying, how do you atone for atone For Adam, they prostrated [Al -Baqarah: 34], as the fulfillment of the punishment is forbidden, and it is forbidden to make the custody related to its entry, and because the appearance is that it said (they said) And the conversation on the way of its proverbs as we will achieve it.For whom the arrival of the purpose is in which the compassion is on the whole of the sentence of what you have in all of the earthly When we presented it that the remembrance of the creation of what is in the land and its time for our sake, the smile is prepared to watch the remembrance of our affairs after the remembrance of our mind, and it is not the same.It is (as) this is more for sure.Abu Ubaydah said it to the son of Al-Muthanna, and he sought the saying of Al-Aswad bin Ya`far: So, and that is not his pain for his remembrance and the forefathers of the authority of God.So, “So“ to be in the house, the fold of the fold, and in a narration.”So,“ there is no crawling, and the dimension is in the vicinity For and if they were treated, the proxy is treated, or the compassion of the story would be on the story and support it that it begins with it the lean of the miracle, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the sake of the sake of God She sees that she was also mentioned in his words, and when we said to the angels, they found the Adam [Al -Baqarah: 34] and you were not mentioned in between them, and it is (when) With the appreciation of the remembrance, and its counterpart is many in the Qur’an, and the intended from the relationship of remembrance and story with time, but it is what happened in that time.The name of time is specialized without the name of the place, because people are aware of the chain of transmission of the Hituctic and the stories to the etiquette of their fall.And the words of God Almighty to the angels are released on what they understand from his will, and he is the one who expresses him with the breathtaking words, so he is able to say that he hears the words of him A truth and its chain of transmission to God because he created that saying, and a boundary, and a usual means of ways, and it is necessary that it is another sign of will, so the release of the saying is that it is a metaphor for it For the minds, and the metaphor It is stronger than the metaphor, which is in the context of the saying of the Prophet ﷺ.And the Almighty said (He said to her and to the earth, a good or a hatred.The father of the Najam said, when I said the prolongation of the right to the right, and there is no exaltation in searching for one of the two imams.The angels are the king of a king, and the origin of the form of the collection “your angels” and the time to confirm the collective because of what is from the eternity in the sense of the group, and the back of the The language of the Arabs is one of the victorious words of them, when they were believed that the property is the daughters of God, and the Arabs were also hurt by the Arab The collection of mortality as millions and shams, and what is indicated by it is the saying of some of the poets of Abd al -Qais or otherwise.؎ I used to be human, but for you ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ And they disagreed in his detection, and Abu Ubaidah said, he is an act of you in the sense of (P-398).To him, and the origin of me is, if not a verb.Rather, the name of the king was derived from the sending, because the angels are the messengers of God, either by a man In it the spirit.The message, and the angel and angels are said to open the lam and its annexation, so they stir in it a place where a place is a fill, so it is a similar row.Ibn Kaysan said: It is a derived from the king with the opening of the mim and the silence of the mother, and the king in the sense of power.He is a matter of the eyes of the eye, and the opening of the hazardine is a disgrace, and it was answered by the fact that the pretext of increasing a letter without a pluralistic claim is distant, and the response of the sake of the ritual, Abi Ubaidah went, and Al -Qurtubi was transmitted from Al -Nadhar ibn Shamil that he said: I do not miss the king at the Arabs.He wants to Arabize him from the transit language, and he supports him that the mortality was called the king an angel with lightness, and the word is not required to be brought in the word In a sign that it is a mobile one to the other, except with other evidence.And the angels are a numerous, millions of mummies, and they are able to form in the absence of habit, because the light is subject to the formation of it in the way of not.She is crowded, and its light is not a beam, so this is not illuminated if it is connected to the land of the land, but rather it is formed if God wants to appear with them for some of them.A violation face Usually.God has made the power of the guidance to the things that God wants to form it, so the mobilization takes over to it and for this and the rituals of the angels, Many are excused by it, and it is anti -of the throats of the demons, for the good maids are among the wives of the angels and their relationship with the souls of the soul, and the goodness of the good Evil.And the successor is in the origin, which is left otherwise, or it is an exact of it in a work that he works, so it is an effective in the sense of an act and the time in it is like the flag.What is meant by the caliph is either the metaphorical meaning and it is the one who does the act of the agent like the agent and the commander, that is, he is in the land, who does not do what is in the land that does not.A liking or a metaphor is sent and not in fact that God Almighty was not in the land and there is no factor in the work that he bid him fare God Almighty did not leave action that he would do, so he would be all to the human being, but the great mobilization, and God is still exalted.His creation is to be shrouded in the earth’s creatures with great face Perceptions before a group of times that are called hypocrisy and the lava with a broken and broken b.Their name was said to be the same as the first of them, and I calculate it from the leadership, and that the placement of these two names is from the chapter on the saying of the people (Hayyan ibn Bin) It is not known.Perhaps this is achieved for the people of the stories from the perpetrators of the horse or the Lean, for the Persians claimed that it was before the human being in the earth, the whims of the name of the name, That the earth was perpendicular to the creatures called “Titan” and that “Zaff” - which is the cheerful - is the largest of the arms in their beliefs - they are from the ground for their corruption.And all of this contradicts the verse of the verse, for the fact that the remembrance of the earth’s creation, then the heavens, by mentioning his will, are the highness The earth after its creation, for the succession is here, which succeeds the owner of the thing in the publication in its mammals, and it is not necessary for the creature to be in place in the place, so the one who is in the place is in the place of the place.Adam, and his succession of his resurrection by the dedication of God to the Almighty from the Earth of the Earth with the delusion or by the revelation and the thrill of its offspring, the intention of God, the Lord of God This behavior tells Adam to the Sunnah of the regime for his family and their families on the basis of their number and the breadth of their expansion.The verse was from this direction as a gesture to The need for human beings to establish a successful person to implement the chapter between people in their struggles, as there is no regime that does not evaluate the human beings, and that is the same, and the absence Perhaps the message and disagreement gathered, and perhaps they were separated according to what God wanted from his parts until Islam came, so the missionary and the convergence were gathered because the religion of Islam is from the one It is the conclusive project, and because the fraud of religion and the king is the most complete of the two plans.After the death of the Prophet ﷺ on the establishment of the caliph to protect the nation’s system, and the provision of the law, and no one is removed from that of the private, or from the public, except for those who are those who have come to them After what the guidance shows them, from the dryness of the Arabs and the claim of temptation, the debate is with their lords.(P-400) For the caliph, there are conditions that are placed by the books of jurisprudence and speech, and its occasion will come in coming verses.And it is clear that his speech is up to the angels, when he did the creation of Adam when the soul is blown in it or before the blowing and the first of the first He made him a successor is that created as he says who wrote a book in a gorge His book is a book for a flame, and it is permissible for their speech to be before the creation of Adam, and on all the faces, the name of the actor is in his saying (Jad) Because he described the caliph, it was not fixed to the time of time.And God said this is directed to the angels on the face of the news to marke them to the knowledge of the preference of humanity on the face of what God knows that God knows that it is in what God knows in that The jewelry, and to be like the spread of them, will be honored for them, so it will be a learning in a template of a crime, such as the meeting of the teacher, which is unique to the slave in the image The spread in the matters, and the angry of the angels on the precise and hidden from the ruling of Adam as well as the interpreters.And when his spread was made to be a comparative fact in the existence of the creation of the first human being until it is a law that I will drink it The comparison of something from the conditions and suffering of the formation of something, affecting the familiarity between that of the lying and between the comparison.Perhaps this subordination will be made in the suffering that is not found only for the delicacy of the place of the formation of the formation in the self.Likewise, if he wants to compare a meaning, or an politician, he will be able to collect the principle It is up to what He wanted to be the acceptance of science from the characteristics of the human being.This is the face of the holy aspect of the name of God, with the righteousness in the verbs, so that they may be compared to its severity with the memory of his name, which is overwhelmed by the righteousness of the righteousness.The verb, and this is also asking for the project to imagine the most complete cases and the best of the rituals of the honesty in the virtue of the work and the tasks of the demands, and the progress of this in the words of the words.We will remember what is related to the Shura when his saying is up and their success in the matter in Surah Al -Amran.(P-401) The story of this saying to God was given the title of the Lord, because it is a saying that is a great man The grace of a tin, tough with kindness and goodness, and that is one of the suffering of the grapes as it was presented in his saying, “Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Fatihah: 2] Approximately to all the types, I add the Lord to the annexes of the kindergarten, which is the prophet Muhammad ﷺ with his honor with the honor of the speaker.* * * They said: Do you make in it those who spoil in it and shed blood.And when we said to the angels, they would find a prostration, and they would be prostrated, and the answer was separated and did not kindly compose the fulfillment or the waw, running on it on a way followed in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an An Arabic way, Zahir said: It was said to them that they would not ride forms.And Rabiah ibn al -Ajaj said: The daughters of the uncle said, O Lord, and that it was a numerous manner, she said, even if they deleted the emotion in his lords, as the freedoms of the emotion The saying is that the conversation requires the return in the majority, so they went back, so they deleted the emotion in the whole, and it is a lot in the download, and perhaps they will be kind to you.The violation of the recovery, even if the compassion is the oppression and the original, and this is what was not preceded to its revelation from the methods of the Arab recovery, and what is the one who is the one He said, O people, worship God, what you have of God, otherwise, do you not fear [the believers: 23].So we sent a messenger from them to worship God for what you have of God, otherwise you will not fear [the believers: 32] and the fullness of his people [the believers: 33] etc.The intended is the story of the inclusion, but rather the intention of the news about the statements that were run or the sayings were what was done in the separate or separate marshes.And this appears for you in his saying.I kill Moses [Ghafir: 26] Then he said: Moses said that I was hidden by my Lord and your Lord [Ghafir: 27] Then he said, and a believer man from the Farisan family said: I make an answer to (as) in it for what we presented, as it is that it leads until they are their saying, and I will make it the story of the story and that it is a sentence (for) The custodian is a follower of the actor.(P-402) The storyteller of the words of the angels are based on its truth, guaranteed by the meaning The understanding of this here with the way of the Kanaya with the request of what removes their denials and re -repetition, so this is to seek the help of the confession of the right to the truth The understanding is here for the extent of the admiration, and who presented the angels on this question that they knew that God, when he told them, wanted them to show their knowledge of this They are hidden from the honesty and the integrity of every source, so when this was established in their souls, a sign of it is correct that it is that it is from it, if it is from the one who knows it from God The spread of the spread is that the spread appears to be what he sees as a advice, and in the hadith “The spread is a trustworthy and he is in the vicinity of what he did not speak,” it means if you speak to him, so he should do.He crossed the connector, his connection to gesture to the face of the construction of words, which is the understanding and the admiration, because whoever was from the corruption and the shed does not reconcile to the time We break what he built.And the blood of the bloodshed is overwhelmed by corruption for the sake of it.And it is to reinforce the earth to the ground for its fulfillment of it and the memory of the time of its age and the preservation of its regime so that it would be that it entered into the admiration of the disagreement If it is in the spread.Corruption is presented in its saying, “They are the spoilers [Al -Baqarah: 12] and the softening of the qatra and has been overwhelmed in their words.Baja.And in the coming of the prayer, a sentence is a sign of significance that the corruption and the softening of this creature are of this Hurry up from the attributes of this creature that is used by the Nurani awareness of the form of the formation of the physical, the mind and the urbanism of this.The caliphate, or their vision, is a picture of his installation before the soul of the soul in it and after it, and it appears that they saw it after the breath of the soul in it, so that it is in it.His owner can be removed from the jabbah to the acquisition, and from the compliance to the disobedience, the mind is covered by the shame, angry, rational, and rational, and it is a sane, and it is sane, and it is a sane, and it is sane, Crafts of thought gets a bare and harmful, then that The capacity that is in the wounds is sought to be dedicated to all that is dangerous for the mind and its powers to do it, then the region can seek the disagreement of the disagreement, From that, a great corruption, and from its conditions, is also a great goodness, and the sacrifice of the power of power is a judge that he will come to all of it.And its evil, so it will obtain a mixed action from (P-403) righteous and bad, and the scenes of the angels are exhausted for this strange creature that is intended to make it sufficient in the land in the land They surrounded them with the wonders of the adjectives on the part of what will appear from them in the outside; Because their orbit is an end in the heavens for its peace from the articles of the material, and if the people of humanity are avoided in the feeling of hidden things, and in the direction of the naviga, and in the light of the nafusah The smoothness and the devotion in the self in the destruction of their recession in the characteristics of the soul is a jelly The hate.In this, what enables you to do some of those who have the same as the face of the kingdom God, or a measure on a nation that was presented and bound, or a measure on the devoted monsters, when it was found on the ground before the enemy of the elderly, as well Antarctic.Also, I know that the ruling of the angels is what this creation is from the human being, and no one is noticed without another, because it is the ruling of the ruling on the one From them, but it is a ruling on what they reconcile with it with strength, so this does not indicate that their judgment is on the sons of Adam without Adam where this is not the same We mentioned it from the Bayan.The transit of the verb is the one who says it is the one who spoils and sheds you because the horrors indicate the renewal and the limits without the permanence of any of the one who is from it And the shedding of blood is tired because corruption and softening are not in the way of human beings.And their saying, I will make in it someone who spoils an indication that they knew that the intention of God from the creation of the earth is its goodness and the order of its matter, otherwise it was not for the one who has the right There is a satellite, and they knew the intention of God, that is what they have received from him, or from the requirements of the truth The will to meet it to a period, and many verses have indicated that the scientist's convergence is intended for the roll.Your wombs [Muhammad: 22] Those who have cursed God [Women: 52] and he said, and if he takes over, he will seek in the land to spoil in it, and he will be exhausted with plowing, and God does not love.Here, this saying is absent and they are unable to do it; Because that world is not a world of cost, and because there is no absence in a pioneer and the like, like the speech and the hurry to stop the reconciliation on the remembrance of what is in the remembrance of what is in the remembrance of what is in the remembrance of what is mentioned It is from the disclosure, and they are righteous, that salt on the spoiling of one of the most listening, and because the Sufis of that is not the same, then the ruling is upon the authority of the rule He arranges the absence of the corrupt in the case of the case, so this is not the same as the angels.* * * And we praise your praise and sanctify you, the waw is a certainty for the present, as there is no slope of the kindness here, and if it is not after the waw from the one who said But the waw is from the storyteller and is not from the story because they say: (And we praise your praise).One of them is that the abuse of it is the dissolution of the matter to God, the Almighty and the accusation of their knowledge, while they indicated it as the advisor does with those who know that he is a lion from him He will be seen, then he will be delegated as the people of Mashraa said with a measure, when I said, "I would have avoided me in my matter.With a severe misery [ants: 33], meaning that we are fighting it and dedicating it to what he wants from his saying, and I am Muslims.The slave is done with the professor in his search with him, then he declares that he is notified of his knowledge, and that the separation of the one is to be a declaration, or it is a declaration that is a declaration He has what I seemed to be from the prohibitions of the disagreement of Adam, and the rituals of the syntax, and God is exalted, even if he knows their opinions from that, except that their words are ran on the way However, the intention of the flags of others, or because in the same permissibility, it is blessed and worship, or an advertisement for the people of the highest of that.If it was like that, it was not unfair, because the rulings of the saying, if it is overwhelmed by a sentence of another, from the saying, is the one who does not mean that it is not.The estimation of the saying of the saying, unless the saying is in two times, as in his saying, the Almighty, and they said, God bless us, and the blessings of the agent [Al -Imran: 173] on one of the face When those who do not see the correctness of the composition of creation on the news, even if the truth is valid for the kindness of creation on the news and reflects it and that it does not contradict the goodness For the compassion, do not you see that if they are narrated with a heated or affected by a hug that followed him with grace: God has calculated us and the blessings of the agent, or: We are God, and for him, and for Him, and for Him, and for Him, and for Him, and to Him, and to Him They are like that, so the waw and the situation of the sign (P-405) until this is a matter of being involved in the event of their saying, I will make it to those who are not.After being overlooked in Relax and expression.The second indifference is that the wiseness is from their saying, and we praise your praise of the exposure that they are the first of the misfortune, because the sentence is the dignity It spoils the signs of corruption and softening, so what was meant is that his disagreement would fall from it, goodness and corruption, and those who are not issued by the disobedience of God, they are the one who is a disobedience.Whoever falls from corruption, and it will be a decide to the same as a sentence (I make in which someone who is spoiled) is a complement to the dispensation, and this is the one who does it) To the representative of the scouts.And the worker immediately is the understanding because it is what includes the meaning of the verb, especially if the intended is from it, as well as it is also possible (and make it in it) Khalifa.And praise is a saying or a group of words with a work that indicates the greatness of God Almighty and his eagerness.The praise of the words of God, because that is the saying of the eagerness, and they mentioned that the praise is derived from the praise, which is the fast in the water in the water, as it is in the water in the water.As it was released on the bitterness of the stars in the sky, the Almighty said, and all in the orientation of slaughter [Yass: 40] and on the run of the Persians, they said: Let the praise be not in the way Those who are in the worship of God Almighty, and it appeared from him to be praise in the sense of a lineage of praise, that is, the distance, and I want the adversary dimension, which is the raising of any Consideration, and it was said: He was heard, unaware, unaware in the sense of his elimination, reminding him of the dictionary.And when the praise of the praise is taken from the praise on the face of the metaphor, and the face is that it is taken from the word of the grace, and this is the time of this “The double” did not hear a light.And if the praise is as we said, it is a saying or a saying and deed that indicates the greatest, then his saying (with your praise) is attached to it here and in the most frequent of the places in it The saying is covered by the praise of God Almighty and its glorification, and the praise is upon him, so the fabrication of the clothing, that is, we praise the praise of the righteousness of you They were pleased with here.And the tendency to be hidden and purified, and it is either by the verb, as the sanctuary is divided into the monk in the saying of the Qayyis, who describes the dogs of the dogs.؎
