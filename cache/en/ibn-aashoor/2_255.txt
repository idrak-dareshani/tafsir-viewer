The Quranic researcher (P-17) God has no god but he is the lively living that does not take it as a year and does not sleep in the heavens and what is in the land who is the one who intercede for him except for what he does not know They are behind them and do not surround anything from his knowledge, except with what he wants, and his horses expand the heavens and the earth, and their memorization is not.When he mentioned this day of resurrection and mentioned the state of the disbelievers, he was nurtured by the remembrance of the glorification of God, the Almighty, and the reminder of his attributes is the heroes of the disbelief of the disbelievers.Because there are those who intercede for him except with his permission, and this verse was made by the verses of Al -Haddani and the Baath, and this is bound by this.Because it is like the ritual between the preceding and attached purposes.He came in the name of the self here because it appears as a way in the significance of the name that is repeated in this name A century or a compassionate if not to enforce the multiplicity of the name, when this involvement was in the name of Majesty, the knowledge of the knowledge was not referred to the one who sought refuge, so it is not possible for the sake of the readers.Like speaking and discourse, and coloring, such as re -reference, notice, and precedent for the covenant and addition.And a sentence, there is no god but it is a first news from the name of the majesty, and the intended of this sentence is the proof of the Haddimiyyah, and the words may be presented to the connotation of God And the deity of the gods has the same saying: And God is one God, and there is no god but He [Al -Baqarah: 163].And his saying: “Al -Hayy” is a news that is the beginning of a deleted, and the “valid” is a second news of that began deleted, and the intended is the proof of life and the heroes And he described the divine because the life of them is as long as Ibrahim, peace be upon him, said: O father, why do you worship what he does not hear and does not see [Maryam: 42] and this is the one who is the same Because of the significance of its arrest, because it was sympathetic, it would not be like followers, and the appearance of the words of the scouts is that this sentence is clear to what is not included in the It is the existing (P-18) with the confusion of creation, that is, because his choice with divine requires that he does not manage other than him, so this is a success, and it is a disagreement of what he did not.It is not permitted for his expression.And the neighborhood in the words of the Arabs is the one with whom the life is in it, and it is a description in which the perception and the behavior, I mean as the majestic of the well -known existence, it is in the creatures with the transmission of the spirit and the rituals of the soul.And with the lineage to the Creator, what approaches the impact of the adjective of life in us, I mean the adaptation of the beauty with the rituals of the symptoms of the creatures, and the interpretation of the one who spoke to the one: For those who have perceived and verb.And the owner of the scouts (alive) was explained by the rest, that is, the maintenance of life, where he does not know him.The numbers, so it will be used as a fantasy in the necessary meaning, because the proof of life for God is the Almighty, without this meaning, it is only a metaphor or a ritual, and he said: The language is not a phrase for the validity of the knowledge and the ability, but a phrase of the things of the thing in his gender, he said: “So he revived the land after its death,” 164] The description that is named in the knowledge of the speaking of life was called that, because the northern state of the body is that it is a matter of it.Sign up to his fullness and characteristics).And what is meant by the descriptions of God here is the neighborhood of the heroes of the traumor of the shame of their idols, which are beautiful, and how the creation of creation will be.And alive is a similar adjective from alive, its origin is alive as a warning that was tweeting the two, and it is a yyeh by the agreement of the imams of the language, and the writer of the predecessor in the Musalf al -Muhaf After the ya, it is a violation of the measure, and it was said: He wrote it on the language of the people of Yemen because they say alive, that is, a life, and it was said: He wrote it on a language.And (Qayyum), so it is the same as the one who rises, while he is overwhelming, and the origin of Qudoum, so the waw and the ya were glowed, and the one was kept with the silence, so the wow, and the wow, and the wow, The exaggeration in the usual resurrection is a well -known metaphor in the mobilization of people.And as the domain of life and the heroes of divine (P-19), the idols of the participants, because the participants used to know that the developer of the universe is God Almighty, but they made the family And the dominance of the domeful matters, and the partners from the Lawn, they had made all the gods of their god And it is on it.And a sentence: Do not take it for a year, nor a granted sleep for a sentence: God has no god but he is the lively live and to raise the imitation of the void in it, so the sentence is the one who is the same In the sense of (the live alive), and that was separated from it before it.And (the Sunnah) is an action of the Sunnah, and it is the first of the sleep and the backs that its origin is the name of this form, as the pasters of what came on the weight of a verb from the wow, and they said: The form of the time, and the Sunnah of the first sleep, Uday ibn al -Raqaa said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The sleep is known, and it is an eruption that the nerves of the brain are tired of the tiredness of the nerves and from the raising of the broken body that is from the digestion and the work of the nervousness, And the coming of darkness, so the brain and the nervous system, which the brain is managed, is a natural rest.The sense is something, and the burden of the movement of the members, then the sense is absent until the nerves retrieve their activity, so the heened.And the denial of the seduction of the Sunnah and the sleep on God, the Exalted to achieve the amount of life and the milestones of the manner, and the evidence of the talism of science, for the Sunnah and the nommat They are a weak life, and they are impeded from mobilization and the knowledge of what is obtained at the time of their liquidation on the basis.The Sunnah of God is exiled from God, which is not enriched by the denial of the sleep from it, because it is one of the life of those who do not condemn the Sunnah, so if he sleeps, he sleeps deeply, and from the people who take the time The sleep is prevailing, and the Arabs have been able to be able to the slope of the slope.God does not veil his knowledge, a weak veil, no longer, nor dominance, or acquisition, so there is no need for what the pride and the goodness required is that it is the best of the Sunnah of the Sunnah The formation of the existence, and that the remembrance of the sleep is before the beacon, and this meaning was taken as a evil and drafted it with the appropriateness of the industry of the poetry, and he said: And his children from his height and his lords, he wanted from the daughters of the night and his sons, who are the most prominent and the most prominent, and he wanted the Lord of the night to whom they are more than they are more Because the customer weakened a relative of the boy and the daughter.And a sentence: He has what is in the heavens and what is in the land is a report of his individuality with divine, as all the existence of its creatures, and an illusion of his success in the way It is a king of the king, so it is true that it is its values, and it is not that it is notified, and for that, the sentence was separated from the one before it.And the mother of the king, and what is meant by heavenly and the earth is the expansion of the place of the resurrection, so the sentence was indicated by the generalities For the public, you have proven that it is not an abundance of his kingdom, and he obtained the meaning of the confusion, but it increased it, affirming the validity of the chain of transmission The classes of the polytheists, from the Sabbath of the curtains, such as the secrets and the two, and from the Arabs of the Arabs, because the inventory of the meaning of the meaning of the public is not enough The strayed sons, this sentence benefited the altercation of al -Tawhid in its generality, and reported the heroes of the people of the people of the evil in the privacy.And a sentence: Whoever interferes with him, except with his permission, is a determination of the sentences of a sentence: He has what is in the heavens and what is in the land because of what the king of the king has benefited from the king of the king of the king of the king of the king The earth, and what is included in the boundaries of the mourning of that king on him, the loudness of a heart, so he was invalidated and described the divine from others, and the right of the The significance is upon him and the effect of it - which is not responded - with commitment; Because the significance is from the matter of equal and the approach, and the effect is significance, and this is the heroes of the greatness of the Arabs of the Arabs because they did not prove to their family (P-21) Full loudness, but they said: These are our lips with God [Yunus: 18] and they said: We do not worship them except to bring us closer to God.Therefore, this sentence was separated from before.And (that) is more for sure, as it is not indicated by a certain, and the Arabs increase (the) because the indication is indicated by the existence of a certain person, who is suspended.Even if he appears and his existence appears, he was evidenced that there is no length The one who lends to God is a good loan [Al -Baqarah: 245].And the understanding is in his saying: Whoever intercede for him who is used in denial and negation with the revelation of the discretion from him with his saying: except with his permission.And the reaction is presented to it when it is the Almighty saying: There is no sale in it, no disturbance, or an intercession [Al -Baqarah: 254].The meaning is that he does not intercede with him with a right and a curse because all the creatures are his king He intercede for those who want to be forgiven, as it is supported by the elders, from the pursuit of the prohibitions of the expression of the students in the shame of the two of the two, and that came in the hadith of the ritual People come to him to speak to his Lord, and he relieves them from the standing of the account, so he comes until he prostrates under the throne and speaks to him, and he will speak to him.And it is said: O Muhammad, raise your head, ask it, and you intercede.For permission.And a sentence knows what is between their hands and what they left them and do not surround anything from his knowledge of a report and a reputation for what is included in the whole of the whole, and the whole is the one who does not have the same.And when a sentence is included: whoever intercedes it except with his permission, then the life of the lively live is not taken by a year, nor is it a year And he was found from the universes, and it did not indicate its knowledge of what would be, so he confirmed and completely said: (know With his permission, when a question may be asked: Why are they forbidden after the permission?It was said: Because they do not know who deserves (P-22) the rivalry and maybe they were deceived by the distress, and God knows whoever deserves it, so he knows what he knows, For these two meanings, the sentence was separated from what before it.What is meant by what is between their hands and what is behind them is what it is It is noted by them from the information and what was hidden from them or they were distracted from it, or what is signed after them and what happened before them.The hands and the past are the successor, and it was said about that, and they are the two buildings based on the disagreement of the advertisement in the representation of what is between the hands and the backwardness, because what is between me He accepts him and sees him and seeks to reach him and what he succeeded is what is behind his back, so he has been left behind and cut off and did not testify, and he did not see him, and he did not see him, and he did not.The matters of the world and the matters of the last were said, which is a branch of the past and the future, and it was said that the sensors and the minds were said, and whatever it is, the preservation is metaphor, and the one who is intended.And Adam (their hands and backwardness) are domesticated to what is in the heavens and what is in the land by the absence of the mind He is a pursuit of the minds of the minds of the general in the heavens and what is in the land, so the intended is what is eaten in the fields of human beings, which is some, to add to "and do not surround" A sentence was sympathetic and not surrounded by anything of his knowledge on a sentence: he knows what is between their hands because it is a complement to it, as it is: 216].And the meaning (they surround) know completely, and it is a metaphor that is true that the surrounding of the woman requires that it contains all of its parts, in which it is not in it The last of it, the meaning: they do not know the knowledge of the levies, something of its information, and as for what they call it, it is a manifestation of the unseen, so the knowledge is in his words: The creature, and added it to the guarantee of the name of the Majestic, is a specialization for him with the religious sciences that God has been affected by it, and God did not establish, or God is upon her Therefore, he said it, except with what he wanted to warn about it that he has been filled with some of his descriptions on what is the characteristics of his knowledge, as he said.One [Al -Jin: 26] except for those who are satisfied with a messenger [Al -Jin: 27].(P-23) And his saying: His chairs expanded the heavens and the earth is a report because all the camels include all of the greatness of God, the Exalted, His Great, His knowledge, and his knowledge, and his knowledge, and his knowledge His custody of the bone of his affairs, or for the sake of his king, as well, as we will show it, and this camel has been made.And the chair is something that is committed to it from the sticks or otherwise, as it is equal, as it is equal.Its rings, if it is more than one sitting and it is raised, then the throne is, and it is not intended in the verse of the Kurds, as he does not fit God Almighty To make it a bias, so you can be intended for it, other than his right.And the gathering said: The Karsi is a great creature, and it is added to God to the Almighty to his greatness.Because the chair was not mentioned in the Qur’an except in this verse and he was repeated the remembrance of the throne, and their remembrance did not want to be associated with us As the heavens were mentioned with the throne in his words, the Almighty: Say: Whoever is the seventh heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne [Al -Mu'minun: 86] and it was said: The chair is the same The throne, and it was narrated in that on the authority of Abu Dhrar that the Prophet ﷺ said: “What is the chair in the throne except as a shaved from a new one who was thrown between my back, and he said: Al -Ash'ari, Al -Saddi, and Al -Dahhak: The Karsi is the position of the two feet from the throne, that is, because the one who is sitting on a throne will be a lifeline from the land, so it is placed for it, so it is placed for it.His feet in hypothesis if he does not take it, and this is narrated from Ibn Abbas.It was said: The chair is an example of the knowledge of God, and it was narrated from Ibn Abbas because the scientist is sitting on a chair to teach the people, and it was said: a proverb of God So that the owner of the verse of Iraq, that is, the king of Iraq, said Al -Bidhwi: Perhaps the king who is called the king of them with the rocks of the brokers.I said: The Qur’an has proven seven heavens, and he did not show its name in his saying (Surah Nuh): Did you not see how God created seven heavens: Light and make the sun a larger [Noah: 16], so it is permissible for the heavens to be the platforms of the atmosphere, the different of the characteristics, which is characterized by what it is filled with the wealth, And the exalted (Surah Al-Malik) said: We have decorated the worldly sky with the swings [King: 5] and it is permissible for the heavens to be the great crocodiles of the bond of the arrival (P-4).So, Mercury, and Al -Zahra, and this is under the sun to the ground, the sheikh and the cheerful, the sacrifice, and the Uranus, and Nabat, and this is on the authority of the sun in this way.However, it is in the greatness of the size, its greedy is the bitter, then it is sagging, then they were wrap Zahla, and the rest seven is the masculinity and the moon is included.And if the Karsi is the throne, then there is no need to prepare the moon, and this is the phenomenon, and the sun is from the total number For people, they have a light for the land, except that the sun is greater than all of it on all estimated, and if the heavens are the seventh of the thickness of the thickness of this, this is the seventh of the thickness of this For his system, as this sun has its system, then this is permissible - and the grace of who Do not surround the greatness of the fate - so that the meaning is that God Almighty warned us of the greatness The same thing, but it was not separated by us because his detailing is not from the abuse of the recipient of his greatness, and because the minds do not reach it to his understanding to his understanding to his understanding to his understanding of his understanding of his understanding to his understanding Science and remedies in which they have not yet completed, and you have learned his news after time.And a sentence: their memorization does not intend to compose it with a sentence: the expansion of its chair is because it is from its completion and in it a guarantee, its return in the one who is before it, that is, it is before it, The worlds are not miraculous.And (Ada) made it with a hand, and the hand - with the sake of the savage, and the meaning of its heavily, because the heavily of the heroic is gruesome and it becomes a hand.He was overwhelmed by him, and he is the great, because it is from his blame, and the greatness and the greatness are upgraded to the honor of destiny and the majesty of power.And for this verse is a great virtue, because it was concluded from the origins of the knowledge of the attributes of God, as well as the surah of salvation on that, and as well as the word.In the two correct ones, on the authority of Abu Hurairah, “He came to him at night, so I took from the food of the zakat of the fancy, so he did not hold it, he said to him: If you are not brought to your bed, then he will be read.God is preserved and does not bring you a Satan (P-25) until you become, "The Prophet said to him ﷺ: To him: “O Abu al -Munazar “Whoever reads the verse of Al -Karsi in the ruins of every prayer is written that he did not prevent him from entering Paradise except the death” and in it is a lot of frequently, and the one who is in the past.
