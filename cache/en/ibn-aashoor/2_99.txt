The researcher is the one who was an enemy of Gabriel, for he has sent him down to your heart with the permission of God, sincerely for what is between his hands and guidance and a young man of the believer: [97] And his angels, messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, for God is an enemy of the disbelievers, the occurrence of his sentence, the occurrence of the sentence before it.The Prophet of God [Al -Baqarah: 91] and his saying, “Say a smile that commands you“ and his saying ”Say: If the last house is for you [Al -Baqarah: 94]“ So the whole is the one who says: We believe in what was revealed to us because they showed it an excuse for the symptoms of the Muhammad's allegation, and it is a liar excuse that they will be excluded from the righteous, and it is the righteous in the righteousness, and it is the righteous in the righteousness On a man from others, his prestige came to the foregoing by saying to the virginity of their excuses and the sacrifice of their intention.The first of what they said is that their saying is believed in what was revealed to us [Al -Baqarah: 91] that they accept what was revealed to their messengers that they have come to them.By denying, harm and disobedience, and that by saying, “Say: Why do you kill“ and say it ”say a luxury“ etc.(P-620) and I want to be nullified by that They are revealed to them, and they are free to work on it, so they are far from the distance from the intention of the survivor in the hereafter by saying it, if it is the one who is the last of the house.] Thirdly, that this excuse is the one who is aware of them from faith with the proof that the person who is pleased with them is the envy by saying that he is the one who was an enemy of Burr.[97] This connection supports the fall of the guilt in his saying, “He descended” is based on what God has revealed in the verse that is in the verse of the heroes, and for that, then this is the same as this Her siblings, and because she has no relationship with her to the close camel, so she is overwhelmed by her, so she came to her.And the enemy is hateful and it is derived from the number of it, in a sense and a sense, because the hateful of the opposite is the opposite to take care of it and its adultery.And Gabriel is a transcendent name for the king who is sent from God, the Heavy Him, to Him, Mark, Merkat from two words.And in it there are languages ​​that are famous for Gabriel, as Qatmar, and it is the language of the people of Hijaz, and the reader reads.(And Jabriel (with the opening of the gym and the breaking of the pioneer, and it was located in the readings of Ibn Katheer, and this is a decrease in actual acts that there is no example in the words of the Arabs.Also, the conquest of the Arabs and between the Arabs and the broken thunderbolt, which is a language, and it is a rhetoric, and some of the people of Najd and read it with a gossip.Between the lame, a broken thunderbolt, with which the father of a bad one has read, in which there are other languages, which are read in the hugs.As for the word of Jabr, we grabbed it when the fans are transmitted from the transmission.It is in the sense of a servant and verification that it is in the transit in the sense of power.As for the word Il, it is with the gathering a name of God Almighty.Abu Ali al -Farisi went to the reverse of the saying of the masses, so he claimed that the mighty of the name of God Almighty and the slave of the servant, which is contrary to what is in the language of transit.The ritual of the father of Al -Ala'i Al -Mara’i, my opinion is my father, Ali Al -Farisi, in the chest of his messenger, which he addressed to Ali ibn Mansour Al -Halbi, who is known as the son He said: He knew the algebra, which was attributed to Jabriel, and he is in all the goodness, as a path that in the place of a minister, etc.That is, God, who attributed Jabriel to his name, has the name of his name is a mighty man who wants that division, and this is an alienation from him and his alerts on his wonders.And the enmity of Jews for Gabriel, it was established from the time we descended by the Qur’an on Muhammad ﷺ (P-621) and it was said that he descends on the nations who have lied to the nations, and he lied to the nations, and he lied.It was reported by Al -Qarbi from a hadith that was brought out by Al -Tarmahi.And he said, “Whoever was an enemy of Jabril [Al -Baqarah: 97]” a general condition that is intended for a special and they are the Jew.The intended intention of the comprehensiveness to know that God does not care about them nor others from those who are hostile to Gabriel if he has another hostility.Jews have been known in the city that they are the best of Gabriel in Al -Bukhari on the authority of Anas ibn Malik who said: The Prophet said: I ask you about three people who do not know them except for the first of the clocks?We told me, Gabriel, who said: That is the enemy of the Jews from the angels, so they hate him because it comes in what is in it in the severity and the matter of the matter, and in the matter of the dead.They wrote them in the eighth and nineteen.The interpreters mentioned other reasons for their hatred of Gabriel.And it is strange that they are contradictory, that they prove that it is a king who is sent from God and they hate Him, and this is one of the degradation of the decades in the mind and the mind, and there is no doubt The necklace is one of the greatest viewers of the nation because it predicts the grief of their opinions on mistake and the insults.And his saying is that he sent him down to your heart with the permission of God [Al -Baqarah: 97] The destiny erected with “his descending” is a good for the Qur’an, either because he is a saying of it.Believe in what God has revealed [Al -Baqarah: 91], either because the verb does not reconcile except for Him here at a limit until it was hurried with the veil [p.32], so if it is not possible, if it is up to the one [83] The sentence is based on the condition of the condition.It is noteworthy that what is meant is that it is not necessary for his enemies because he is a mediator of his ears, God By descending by the Qur’an, he understood his support, but they are repeated, so the appreciation of those who were an enemy of Jabril, so he does not return to God.And this face is better than what they mentioned and endeavored to say, "The permission of God" and the appearance of his saying after it: “Whoever is a mour They will know it and it is permissible for the estimation that it has been revealed to you, whether they love him, or they will be in the sense of alienation from you.Al -Rabi` ibn Ziyad: ؎ Whoever was pleased with the killing of your money, let us come to our faces with the face of a day.So it is not easy to kill, for we have killed him before the morning of the morning, for if he killed him from the guardians of those who were (P-622), he was murdered with his killing.It is permissible for the meant to be, for it is that it has descended from it from God, sincerely for their writing and in it this guidance And their annexes for those who came to him, and the appreciation has been destroyed.And the two people who say the confirmation in his saying, “He descended it” because they are denying that.And the heart is here in the sense of the soul and what the memorizers and understanding are, and the Arabs are called the heart on this matter that is intended.They also call him the subconscious, the german, as he said: As if the hearts of the bird are moisturizing, dressed, and “sincere” is a state of the stipulated of the man Because of the enmity of Jews for Gabriel, that is, he descended it in comparison with a condition that does not require their enmity to him because he sent him a charity to what is between his hands and the goodness.And the experienced friend with a honesty.The imam of piety was introduced to the verb of believing to the significance of the strengthening of that belief, that is, it is a valid, and no one who does not have anything Mttiqa, the Qur’an was notified of the convergence and the Gospel, and it was described as a guidance and a light as in the Supplied Suraida.The messengers of the messengers are believed from the first of the sincerity of the truthful because the chicken claiming the prophecies come to the denying of those before them, because they did not come to them.The delusions of the rituals, so they do not help them, and that is why the forefathers were warned of those who are a lie, as he came in the positions of the dew and the Najil.What is meant by what is between his hands is what he preceded, and it is a sequence of the precedent, because the previous one comes before the precedent, and it was not the same as the predecessor, and it was not the same.The precedent and the Qur’an, and because the connection of the work with it between its nations to the coming of the Qur’an, then make their predecessors to be dominated by the time of the Qur’an, so they were before.The guidance is a description of the Qur’an with the source The intention of the exaggeration in its guidance.And Al -Shari al -Akhbar by obtaining a good thing or by watching its crops.The best of the world and the best of the last.He has obtained from the five descriptions of the Qur’an, which is that it is revealed by God with the permission of God.And it is a slogan on the heart of the Messenger.And it is true for the books that preceded it.And it is this, the most important.And that it is the (P-623) for the believers, praise for the Qur’an with the generosity of the original, and the generosity of the headquarters.And the generosity of the category.And the abundance of goodness to follow the choice is good, urgent.And a promise to them with the punishment of good.This is the qualities of the generous man.And his house.And its people.The generous of the virtual vulnerability with it, and it is a characteristic that the house of the glory of the glory is seen: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎

returned and returned to the hereafter to their commitment to their enmity, God is the messenge The elders of God because he is the messenger, and the people of His messengers because they have returned to the Messenger, and the people of the angels are for that, so their enmity has become Gabriel as the one in the middle of the simple Rather, the two small and great older ones are over, so God is their enemies with the oldest of the oldest, because it is the cause in the meaning of the contemplation.And their enmity the messenger with the home of the small older because it is the reward that is proven to him, so he does not want that there is no face to the remembrance of the enmity of God.The angels and the messengers are an enmity of God on the one who obeys the Messenger.The angels of the angels and the messengers have proven to them that they were Jabriel and Muhammad, because when they returned, they returned to Jabril for the sake of his sake of what is from the Tabal the command of God is the goodness, for that is their characteristic.For that is a way that is not Jabriel in it, and so, when they were Muhammad, for the sake of his coming in the abuse of a special reason for it, it was a matter The description that is the bost of the Messenger of the Messenger, so whoever is normal was true that all of them are hostile to them, otherwise his action was governed by it.Gabriel specialized in remembrance here for the increase in the perpetrator of his hostile punishment, and to remind him of Michael, and perhaps they are back with them, or because they claimed that they were allegedly.And torment, and that the Michael of the Messenger of the Character and Peace be upon him, and they said: We love Michael, so when I want to warn them that their angels are the angels, they will be done to them Gabriel for his intention to intend it, and he would have met him, so that they would not be deluded that their love is Michael, the believers are established.And in Michael, there are no languages, which are a mike after a thousand, and after the prodigy, and the second of the second (P-624) was read (P-Michael) After the gossip, and it has a sophisticated reader.The disbelievers have the condition of the condition.The blessing of the house and his saying is exalted and found God for him, and his account has fulfilled it [Al -Nur: 39] An enemy or a enemy, as it is a enemy, as it is the great of the great ability to the great ability of the faithful.With the infidels, all the disbelievers come and come in the year so that their entry is in it, as is the verdict of judgment with the same.Let the sentence be a sacrifice for what before it.
