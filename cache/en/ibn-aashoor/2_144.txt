people of the sufferings, so they saw “in the questioning of the news.It benefits the realization of the verb, and it is with the verb with a house.He said, so do so.And when the knowledge of God was what is in which the prophet does not doubt ﷺ until he needs to fulfill the news of it, the news of it was with his affirmation of his affirmation in his affirmation of his affirmation in the same way To pay the duties from it (P-27) and to reassure it because the Prophet was keen on his acquisition, and that promise is obligated to collect it.He came with the harms with “may” for the use of renewed and intended to be renewed for his necessity to be sure of that obligatory, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is good.” The inner is the one that is likely to be a lot like it may be done.Ubayd ibn al -Absa said: ؎ I have left the century, whose finances are as if his dwellers were gathered with pursuit and will come to the increase of a bias for this when he said: It is saddened by those who say [Al -Anam: 33] in Surah Al -Anam.And the heart is folded by its heart if it turns it, and it is the same as its heart by lightness, so what is meant by the imitation of the face is the fools of it, that is, it is transformed from it, then it is from it.He repeated it in the sky, and they took from the enemy to the form of the effective effects in the sense of multiplication in this manifestation, and in which there is a look, when this is what this is in this From anthropology and intensity, the interaction of the power of the Kayfa, they said, the Prophet ﷺ was falling in his pillar, in order that God will turn him into a maaka It is said that we are waiting for the descent of Jabril with that, and when I was like that, it is necessary that it would be mulch Jabriel referred to that that he did not remember this conversion.And the fulfillment of our success To confirm the promise of the wise after the best of it, for the writing in its saying, we may see that you will turn your face, and the recitation of the words of the words of the words of them is what the words are upon them.Be which they were before them [Al -Baqarah: 142], so we mean, let us kiss you before you, we will come to you.He was erected by the dates of the second and originally effective house: We will give you from a kiss, and also his saying, and the one who has the same.And the meaning: that he takes care of his face to the cord will get the heel of this promise.This is a matter of delicious tools, affirmation, and tool, and that is the end of the kindness and the charity.He crossed its satisfaction with the significance that his mile to the kaaba is a tendency to intend the good, based on the fact that the kaaba is the most powerful of God, that it is the same By receiving the house of the sanctuary, (P-28), and because in its acquisition of a gesture to the independence of this religion from the religion of the people of the book, and when the satisfaction is a sense of the sake Choose in this place without “you love it“ or “it is tired” or they are like them, because the denomination of the Prophet ﷺ is raised on the behalf of his money, with what is not.The exhibiting reconciliation of the holy building, not to see that when it came in the side of their kisses, then after it came to it, it came to it, and it came to it.After what came from the science [Al -Baqarah: 145] the verse.And his saying, and your face is separated from the promise, and the meaning of it, and the meaning: your face in the case of prayer, and it is beneficial from the horns of the words of the words on the argument The kiss of the prayer.And the speech is for the Prophet ﷺ and the matter is directed to it by adopting the pleasure of his desire, and he will follow him by sharing the nation with him in the matter with him, and he said: Its dewy.And the dilemma, with the opening of the sheen and the cousin of Ta`: the side and the side, and its pleasure was made by a meeting with a meeting.Because it is the stretch of the thing, because the halves are called the half of the thing, so when it was added to the mosque and the mosque is a place that it is required that his half is a dome And its coast, and its stretching, and made the waters of the mosque as a fennel from the kaaba because it is a satellite from the mosque in the half of the place of the place of the authority Approximately, Abd al -Jabar said: It indicates that what is meant is what we mentioned and Jahan, their limits: that the worshiper, if he stands, where he is going to the mosque and not to the mosque, and not Al -Kaaba does not correct his prayers, the second: If we did not break the part of what we mentioned, he did not remain for the remembrance of the male, when he sings to say: It was the duty to go to the mosque, not to the kaaba.If you say: What His saying is his saying, so let us give you a kiss before you will say before his saying, and your face is, so he said: In the sky, then your face.Etc., I said: I was increased by the purification of the fulfillment with the desire of the Messenger of God ﷺ and that it is in terms of its accusation of it as it is indicated by it and describing the kiss with a sentence.And the meaning of “we will give you”: We are invoking you, and in the conclusion is a merit, because the one who is transgressing himself is not in the meaning With him, and from him the loyalty and the guardian, and the most promising that his transgression is a second effective from the way of the deletion, and the ability: He is his face to such and then, then they will return it to a third (P-29) So they say: It is like this and descending it as a house that is obligated to the proportions of the two other people, so they will be able to do so: He who was up to him before, and by disbursing his recipients, the suffering is different as it was presented.The kiss is here a name for the place that the worshiper accepts, and it is either derived from the name of the body, or from the name of the verb as it is presented.And the mosque mosque, the mosques, who is known to the Muslims, and the forbidden: the one who is the one The prohibition is authorized to avoid something, so the avoidance is understood in every place with what is appropriate for it.He was famous for the Arabs and described the Mecca in the forbidden country, that is, the variety of the garments, the darkness and the aggressors, and was described as the forbidden in the saying Your forbidden house [Ibrahim: 37], meaning the greater Widgered descriptions of the Arabs, but the name of the mosque is the forbidden, it is from the Quranic nicknames, he made a knowledge of the rituals of the heel, which is the wickedness of it And it was not known to the mosque in the ignorance of the ignorance, as they had no prayer with prostration and the mosque the place of prostration, so the name of the mosque is the knowledge The counted is the one who surrounded the heel, and it has doors from it: the door of Safah and the door of the sons of Shabba, and when this flag was released on what was surrounded by the heel, it was not repeated from the people of the people.What is meant by it, the mosque is the forbidden of the Islamic names before the migration, and its remembrance was mentioned in the wall of the pride and it is an angel.And the gathering is that what is meant by the mosque is the ritual, here is the game of the correct news that the kiss was shown to the kaaba and that the Messenger of God is the one who is the Messenger of God.And that he prayed to Al -Kaaba on the day of the conquest, and said: This is the kiss.Or what It is included on him, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas: The house is a kiss for the people of the mosque, and the mosque is before the people of the sanctuary, and the forbidden is a kiss for the people of the people.Al -Fakhr said: This is the saying of your money, and I say: This is not known about your money in the books of his gold.The gospel of the mosque was affected by the second verb for the state and not based on the custody.(P-30) And he said it, and wherever you were, and your faces, its parts are amending the belief of the ruling of the ruling of the kaaba for all the Muslims, and the one who is the same For their fall in the context of the condition of the condition, wherever it is for the sake of the arms of the land, lest it not think that his saying is the one who is the one who is the gospel of the mosque.His saying, and your face is a rhetoric of the mosque, a discourse for the prophet.The sky is to be a fusion of him and knows that his nation is like him because the origin of Islamic legislation is that the Messenger and his mother are blessed, unless there is an indication of a delicacy, and a delicacy, and a delicacy, It is afraid that this judgment is for it, or that it is divided into time, or some of the flaws, such as the city, and the Mecca, I want the blind in the costs, and in the country, and in all of you With the kindness of Waw, but it was enough to say: Woe to your faces.So what indicates that the intention of the place is permissible and affirming the general public, which is beneficial from adding a partner to the guarantor of the mosque, because the sacrifice is that we are not.The collection in the significance on many individuals, so it was added as the addition of the collection, and a certainty of the municipality of the lawful matter to the righteousness to intend it with this Two of the lineage for the costs, and their conditions, are the central and secondary.These verses are indicative of the path of this future The submission to him, so his good effects have been arranged in his servant’s salvation for his Lord and his indifference to his worshipers, and that is the angel of compliance and conversion.And for this, in the authentic hadith, “Charity is to worship God as if you see him, for if you did not see it, then he is my life.” He brought his greatness to make him a remembrance of him from something that has a special affiliation with him.For those who are miserable and reasonable, and a fictional power is ahead of the world of bodies, and the mind of the mental force is disintegrated from the comparison of the fictional power, then if the human power is, then if it is a matter My mind is a fantasy that has a fictional image that he feels until that image is Fantasy is appointed to the realization of those mental suffering, and when the weak servant was if he arrives at the Jamal of the Great King, it is necessary for him to accept it in the way He has for him with his tongue and in his servants, so he will be excluded in the prayer in the prayer.The prostration runs the course of servants.Ah.(P-31) If it is excused, it is excused by the one who is touched by the sense, then bring it to it, it will be something that has an affiliation with it, as the domesticity, or by the authority, or the same With the likeness, like the deer with the loved ones, and the oldest, the poets were covered with the effects of loved ones, such as the least in its saying, the custody of your Prophet, the coffin, the love of it.Malik Bin Al -Rayb: The passion of the people of the family of my father and my neighbor ∗∗∗ with the whispers, so I turned back and is raised, and God is exalted, and he will be surrounded by the sense of the sense.Clear what is in it, the exaggeration of it.There is no crime that the first of the creatures is to make it a way to bring the Creator in the same servant of his servants that are the creatures that he was present for the sake of the significance of God And his description of the attributes of the Kamal with its extension of everything that is deluded that it is the intended of worship, and that is the mosque that it was built by his pneumatism, and the peace be upon him.It is delusional that he is the intended of worship, and he did not name it in the name of God, so he built the first house, and built a mosque in the place of the mosque, and the mosque, and the son of the mosque, In Al -Tawarah with the title “Melibs”, the daughter of the Sabean was after Noah, so it is so that the glorification of the two and the inclination of the one in the souls, so add it to the souls, so add it to the souls, so add it to the people.And kinds, or to the names of the frozen, and the Masudi mentioned in the boldness of the gold, a number of the homes that were established in the past nations for this one, and from it: India.And our prayer is on the authority of the nickname, with its Sabae, before Ibrahim, and Azer Abu Abraim was from his religion, and it was said that they were the sons of Hayakal from it.If the believer is received by God, something of the house that was established for the contradictions of the people of the polytheism and for the significance of the God of God, and the glorification In addition to it, even if this house is on its many, it is not different except by the salvation of the intention of its residence, and the fact that its residency is for that, and it is for the sake of this The supply, and if you want, you made all these suffering three in one sense, and it is the pre -emption because the precedent from it has distinguished the right to be the one who is the one who is the one The attainment of his foundations said: A mosque was founded by piety from the first A day that is entitled to take place in it [repentance: 108], and he said (P-32) in the remembrance of the mosque of harm, in which you never stand up in it [Repentance: 108], that is, because it is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The first house that was placed for people for those with a blessed cry and a guidance for the two scientists [Al -Imran: 96], so he made him a gift for people because he was the first house, so he was a house.I brought the sanctuary from the effects of the deduction that I guided by the first house.Some of the scholars said: The first kaaba is the first place for the servants and in which there will be a look that will come when he said, “The first is the first house and a place for me.” 96] In the Surah of Amran, and there is no doubt that the first is the evaluation of the neutrality of God and his eagerness, and that of that, and the heights of the angels is the one who is the one who built it.With the evidence and the first of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who gave his hand, so he made the two for the second, then he stayed to create the remembrance of God and the God of the God of God It comes that the cause of the heroes of the worship of the two, and it has been addressed to this house, so his vision became remembered by God Almighty, so the first of God is the first The advantage of the prestige of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, by building him in his hand, and his son was heard without anyone, for this meaning is raised in the connotation of the one who is on the one The believer’s faith is placed, and in this characteristic, it is not shared by others.Then the pilgrimage to it to find this male and its generalization in the other nations, so it is not a crime that it will be the first of the rituals of the one who wants to do so.The truth of the truth and what was built by the house of God, like the Master, the Aqsa, except after it with long centuries, so it was before the Muslims.We have gone out that the condition of a specific side was not a rulings of the wise bodies, and how would it be like that, and the mosque is the best of me Forty years of age and the absence of what was of his inception after the call of Solomon that he was upheaval for the sake of achieving the acceptance of supplication and prayer, not for the sake The hook for the righteousness, and if it is a call, it is a prophetic call that will only be a divine inspiration, so perhaps the wisdom Abraham and Moses, so he wanted to increase the increase in the hearts of the Israelis in his relationship The worship is what calls for their souls to take care of those trains with their hands.It is permissible for God to seek the right to them after that on the Sunnah of the Prophet after Solomon and in it a dimension, because they did not come.Rather, they came Rewarded.So the promise of God (P-33) is the one who is in their prayers in their prayers for a certain destination that is completely in the sense of reverence in the prayer of Islam, so that it is the one who will be from the prayer Humanity for this project to be the consequence of religion in order to share its owner ﷺ and for his nation if the first involvement is, then if the second is the matter, then the matter is for us.Our prayers are weakened by the glorification of God Almighty from the prayer other than us.Therefore, our flags agreed that the righteousness of a certain destination was compared to the law of prayer in Islam, so if it was the one who is excluded from the authority of the vicinity ﷺ I did it that the mosque, whom the people of the two writers, who were not intended, did not interfere with it Whoever wants to be brought up with the height of God Almighty.And if he was upset with the house of the sanctuary with a living from God, then perhaps his ruling, to express the hearts of the people of the two writers, and to appear after that, and for the sake Follow them from the people of the book really and those who followed them are a hypocrisy because the two times may follow Islam as a back On their own, then if the kiss changed, they were afraid of their intention to be able to do it, so they appeared what they were overwhelmed with the infidels as he said, as he said, as he said, as he said.The kiss that you have only to know who follows the Messenger [Al -Baqarah: 143].Perhaps the enemy of the matter is in the interest of the Kaaba in the chest of Islam, it was for the sake of the shake of the ancient Quraysh and their stab With their death and said this is our country, and we are their people and he drew it as a year for him God [Al -Baqarah: 114] And his saying to God, the deceased and the Maghrib [Al -Baqarah: 115] The command of Quraysh has honored the demise and that a seat will be the separation between the Muslims and between them, then God commanded the revelation of the kiss to the one who is the one who is the one who is the kiss of He made it far away from him.* * * And those who have given the book to know that the truth is from their Lord, and what God is unaware of what they do is a symptom between the sentence of the one who is the same You came out of your face [Al -Baqarah: 149].(P-34) It appears that what is meant by those who have gave the book the inhabitants of Jews and the ink of Christians as it was narrated from Al-Saddi as he feels the abbreviation of them.The book of the book.The meaning of their universe knows that it is the truth that their knowledge is with the truth of Muhammad.The evil is in their books, it guarantees that what he brought is true.It also appears that what is meant by those who have gave the book are those who did not remain on the infidels to appear to appear.Their Lord is that the listener is about them that they know that the truth is with his affirmation of affirmation, it is required that the appearance of their condition, when they are denying that they are the one who is the one who has been disturbed.For their obituary, and that the Muslims think that they are accommodated, and the satellite of his saying appears, and what God does not do is what he does.The definition has indicated in his saying that it is the right to the shortness; That is, they know that the righteousness of the cord is the right without it, otherwise, for the knowledge of the copying of their project with the project of Islam, and it was said that they were in the way Before they will be invalidated, and perhaps this is taken from the warnings of their prophets, such Standing thing.And his saying, and what God is unaware of what they do.Work and like it from the perseverance, the stubbornness, and the fool.And this news is as a result of Al -Waed with their parts of their poor manufactures, because the saying of the Qadir: I am not a heedless from the crime, the truth of the one who does not know The penalty is only the science of science, so it was a feast for them and their return is obligatory in the rhetorical position and a promise to the Muslims to the greatness of it They arranged their violators for the believers, so there is no crime that a reward for the believers will be required for the compliance He is afraid of the work of these, and he is rewarded with what he deserves.And Ibn Amir, Hamza, Al -Kisa’i, Abu Jaafar, and Rawah, read on Jacob, in the winter of the speech.(P-35) It is obligatory and a feast for the disbelievers to reflect what the precedent reader requires; And on the two readings, it is a clear way to take every luck from it, and it is a symptom between a sentence, and that those who have gone and a sentence, and if the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.And in his saying, they know and say it for what they do the complete slopes that are kept on the readers ’readings and the deficient slaves that are harmed by the readers of Ibn Amer.
