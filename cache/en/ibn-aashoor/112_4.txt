The Quranic researcher (and he did not have one sufficiency) in the sense of humiliation for the phrase before her because it is a best way from her guarantees; Because these advanced attributes are their wickedness, their signs, and their grace, it is not similar to it other than it, with the benefit of this (P-620) of it, so it is like it.The verbs as the Almighty said: Those who call from God will not create flies and if they gathered to Him [Hajj: 73].Waw in his saying: And he did not have any competence, which is the case.We rewarded them with what they disbelieved [Saba: 17] and it is permissible as the unwind if you are made the first waw an adulterer, so the intended of the sentence is to prove and described it.And the benefit of the meaning of humiliation is a follower of the meaning and the joke, and it is not crowded.The efficacy: by adding the kaf and the fulfillment of fulfillment and an obstacle in the last.And with him, a brief reader, Abu Amr, Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim and Abu Jaafar, except that the first three of the first three achieved the gossip and Abu Ja`far made it easy, and it is said ( Fulfillment and tear, and it has a hamzah and a punishment, and it is said (efficient) with the waves of the bars, and it has a reader of the east, which are three languages.Its means: equal and similar in adjectives.And (one) is here in the sense of a human being or a fence, and it is one of the names that are mandatory for the struggle in the matter of negation.And this is completely with his saying with his saying: Say: God is one [sincerity: 1].And the news of (Kan) is presented on its name for the sponsorship of the separation and to the perpetrator of the male of the sufficiency, the punishment of the exile to be the preceptor to the hearing.And the perpetrator of his saying (He has)) The release is on its attachment, even if the origin is the delay of the comment, if it is a lukewarm.And his delay when Sibuyeh is the best of what was not required to be required as he referred to him in the scouts.It was mentioned in the grace of this surah, authentic and good news.In the authentic hadith, in Al -Muwati and Al -Sahihin, it was made in the narration that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Say: God is one of the average of the third of the Qur’an”).(P-621) And the interpretations that were interpreted by the companions of the suffering of the effects of this hadith, and the collection of the fourth of the interpretations.The first: that it adjusts the third of the Qur’an in the reward of reading, that is, the third of the Qur’an is amended if it is read by its obesity until if the reader had repeated it three times, it was the reward of it.The Qur’an is all.The second: It adjusts the third of the Qur’an if it is read by those who do not improve, other than the lights of the Qur’an.The third: that it adjusts the third of the Qur’an by adopting the snakes of the suffering; Because the meanings of the Qur’an are rulings, tumor and unicorn, and they have been separated This surah, with its collection, is the origins of the Islamic domain, which was not collected.And I say: That was before the descent of verses, like the verse of the Karsi, or because it is not found a single wine with what is in the surah of salvation.The righteous interpretation: that it adjusts the third of the Qur’an in the reward, such as the first interpretation, but it is not obligatory for three times with a full house.Ibn Rashid said in the Bayan and Al -Tashail: The scholars are unanimously that whoever reads (Say: God is one of the one [Al -Ikhlas: 1]) Three times that are not equal in the reward of those who live with the Qur’an.So this is a challenge for the first interpretation, but in his atheism, gathering is that that is what is meant - a look, because in some hadiths, there is no hadeeth that is the same as what is good Mitteries adjust a full seal.Ibn Rashd said: The disagreement of them in the interpretation of the hadith is not intended with anything from the hadith of the forms and does not disturb it that it is in it.Abu Omar bin Abd al -Barr said: Skat is on this question that is better than the words in it.* * * (P-622) (P-623) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of the Clashs, the prophet was called ﷺ This surah (Say I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash).The women narrated on the authority of Uqba ibn Amir, who said: “I followed the Messenger of God ﷺ while he was a passenger, and I put my hands on his feet, so I said: Read, O Messenger of God He said: There will be nothing to read with God from (Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash, and say I seek refuge in the Lord of the people." This is a phenomenon that he wanted a surah (Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash); Because he was an answer to the saying of Aqaba: I read the Surah Hood, etc.Surah is completed (Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash).Al -Bukhari cursed her in his authenticity (Surah, say I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash) by adding a surah to the first sentence of it.It came in some of the words of the companions, whose name is with the Surah of the People (the two men).Abu Dawood and Al -Tirmidhi narrated, and Ahmad on the authority of Aqabah ibn Amir said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ commanded me to read with the pleasures” (with the broken waw and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a tight waw Observers), meaning: the verses of the two surahs.And in a narration (with two refugees in the arms of every prayer).No one of the interpreters mentioned that one of them is called the refuge in the individuals, and Ibn Attiyah Surah was called the first refuge in the first, so the addition of (Surah) to the (Surah) (Al -Muwadid) from the addition of the name to the name, and the description of the surah with that metaphor that makes it like the one who indicates the disagreement at the place that he disobeys from his frightening.And it was called the most of the Qur’an and the great books of interpretation (Surah Al -Falaq).And in perfection: it is the surah of people to call the two people The two righteousness) is one of their saying, a rhetoric.(That is, the sending of the saying that it similar to it with the generous solution of the camels, it is destroyed by a thickness, and it is like the meat that comes from it if it is angry) Those who are involved in that.In the interpretation of the Qarbi and the scout that it is the surah of the people (Al -Muqshasqati) (by subjugating Al -Qaf on the two Shinin) increased the Qatabi: that is: Likewise, Al -Tayyibi said, so the name of the scratch is shared between four louds: this, the surah of the people, the wig, and the surah of the infidel.And it has been disturbed by a mother who is a civil or civilian?Jabir bin Zaid, Al -Hassan, Al -Hasan, Ata and Akrama said: Makkaya, and it was narrated by Kayyib on the authority of Ibn Abbas.Qatada said: It is a civilian, and Abu Salih narrated it from Ibn Abbas.It is more correct that it is an angel; Because the narration of a good person from Ibn Abbas is an acceptance with the disagreement of the narration of Abu Salih on the authority of Ibn Abbas, so it is speaking.Al -Wahidi said: The interpreters said that it was descended by the fact that Labid ibn Al -Asem was the magic of the Prophet ﷺ, and it is not in the chapter that it was descended from this way, and the son of the Lord, and the son It is likely that the surah is a civilian, and it will speak to the story of Bid ibn al -Asem at the saying of the Almighty: and from the evil of the furniture in the contract [Al -Falaq: 4].It was said: The reason for its descent and the surah after that is that a Quraysh was mourned, that is, they were delegated to those who purify themselves among them that he is afflicting the prophet, with his eyes Let them seek refuge with them, and the pride mentioned by Saeed ibn al -Masib and did not dedicate it.And the twelve was prepared in the meter of the light of the light, it came down after the elephant wall and before the Surah of the people.The number of its verses is five with agreement.And it was devoted from Abdullah ibn Masoud in Al -Saheeh that it was denying that the two mourners would be from the Qur’an, and he says: It is the command of the Messenger of God, that is, the Messenger of God (P-625) was not commanded that they are from the Qur’an.The companions of the Messenger of God ﷺ were gathered on the readers in the prayer and wrote in their Qur’an, and it was correct that the Prophet ﷺ read them in his prayers.* * * And the sympathy is the knowledge of the Prophet ﷺ words of the goodness of God from the evil of the evil of evil from the evil times, and the abundance in which there is a lot of people in which The conditions of evil are hidden from behind it, so that they do not throw it, so that it will be done with its risks.With this surah and her sister, and his companions are commanded to seek refuge with them, so he was a dedication to them from the Sunnah of the Muslims.
