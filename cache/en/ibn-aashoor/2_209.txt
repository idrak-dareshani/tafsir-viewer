The Quranic researcher (P-275) O you who believe, enter all the peace and do not follow the steps of the Satan That God is a dear wise man, who is a wise man, a wise man, to be used to enter into the entry into the peace, and the appropriateness of his remembrance is the first of what he accepted.The division of people is the direction of religion, the highest, the highest of whom is the same as the pleasure of the pleasure of God [Al -Baqarah: 207] because the soul is the most precious thing that is made, and the least of those who do not have the same And God is witnessing what is in his heart, which is the heart of the symptoms [Al -Baqarah: 204], meaning that the good will be guaranteed and spoils the people in what is in the whole, which is the good of the land, and the best of the earth, The people who are peaceful, after that people are called to enter, while the name of peace be upon him is called, and this suitability is strengthened and weakened with the weakness Entry in peace.And the discourse, O, those who believed in a speech for the Muslims to the usual Qur’an in the release of this address, and because the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the past.Entry is the right to influence the body in a body or an involved place like the house and the mosque, and it is called a metaphor for the solutions of the place, and it is said.Here is a bothering for the followers, commitment and intensity of confusion with the act.And peace be upon the conquest of the Sunnah and broken it with the silence of the mother, a softening, the son of the son of Kathir, the Kisi, and Abu Ja`far with the conquest of the Sunnah, and read the rest of the tenth.With the conquest of the Sunnah and the blame, he said: “And do not say to those who will give you peace, you are not a believer [Women: 94]) and the right of peace and the sacrifice of the war.” He said: ؎ The Muslim takes from it what you are satisfied with and the war is sufficient for you from its breaths, and this is many of them.By breaking the Sunnah and deriveing ​​it from peace, which is the survival of the mother, the harm, or the stubbornness that is said to be the same as his soul, that is, he gave it to me with a possibility, and the peace of the authority, Owner, and the Arabs say: Islam (P-276) or a war, that is, you are a questioner or a warrior, and all of them are the ones who are generated by some of them, so that there is a good By breaking the Sunnah, opening it, and having to investigate, each one uses while the other is used.They said: The peace be upon his three languages ​​on the religion of Islam, and it is attributed to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and Qutdah, and they sought the saying of the Qayyal ibn al -Qaybi al -Qaddi His people: I called my clan to the peace of what I saw, and they took over our Lords.He was reluctant to mention The companions of interpretation and the richness of the Qur’an and the time of the Qur’an, and the company of the Arabs, did not remember it, and the owner of the Arabs, and his remembrance in the doorstep, is a follower of the one who is the one.Al -Zamakhshari in the scouts is a story in the interpretation of peace here, so it is a release other than reluctant with its confirmation, and the house of the Kandadi underestimates the meaning of the meaning For the Muslims, and his saying (religion) in the sense of the habit of the mandatory as the slave said: “You say and I have turned it to me, and I will give it to me.” Amr ibn al -Alaa al -Salam by breaking the Sunnah is Islam, and peace be upon the conquest of the Sunnah ‌ Which is in the wall of the breath, which is in the surah of Muhammad ﷺ in the opening of the cinema, Al -Tabiri said that he brought him from him because of here it is that Islam without the two times.And the cold denied this separation and said: The language is not taken like this, but rather it is taken by reputation, not by the measure, and it needs those who separate into a sign.The formation of peace is one of the names of the righteousness, there is no contradiction in it among the imams of the language, so it is intended from the verse, not a referral, and its being is called to Islam if it is true that it is permissible for you to be.It will be from the acquisition of the subscriber in its meanings.It is necessary that what is meant by the peaceful Muslim is as it is required by their speech, O you who believed in the one who is like the title of the Muslim, the meaning of the matter was in the matter The fighting, and the form of the matter requires it to enter that its right is required to obtain action that was not a matter or was excessive in some of it.So that it seems to me that the occasion of the remembrance of this verse is the following of what is presented is that his saying is the Almighty (P-277) and they fought in the path of God who are fighting [190] A dedication to the partners of the partners of their adults, Muslims from the house and their immigration that they gathered their affairs on their fighting, and the immorality of the people In the Mecca, when the Messenger of God sent him to Quraysh, so he mentioned that and he was rented after him with the two rulings of Hajj and Umrah, so when he is the right of it and the right of it, the right of it is the right of it By putting it in its position between those verses, they are insulted here with the satisfaction of peace and the reconciliation that the Messenger of God is held, with the year of God, with the year of the year Many of the Muslims were ambiguous from his fall, and among them is Omar ibn al -Khattab, so he said: We are on the right and our enemy on the falsehood, so how can we give.It was narrated by the people of Al -Saheeh, so the period of what is between the Muslim people will be taken away from the one who is the one who is the one between them and the messengers between them and between the Quraysh and what is between the rituals of the rituals His words are exalted and fought in the path of God who fight you [Al -Baqarah: 190] to here.Know that if it is The guilt in his saying is the Almighty, do they see [Al -Baqarah: 210] Refer to the people who marry you or from the people who share itself as it will come, and they will be the saying Enter the peace of the peace between the sentence with the same repetition.But if the peace is interpreted by Islam, that is, the religion of Islam, then the speech is with you, those who believe and command those believers in the entry of Islam, and the command of it is from the command of the matter And the absence of it is because the income of faith is said in its heart if it is stable and enabled, the Almighty said) And when the faith enters into your hearts [Al -Hujurat: 14].The napstel said: I disappeared, if I remember it, a disease is moved in my heart inside, and this is the back.So he wants to enter the permanence on that, and it was said: I want those who believe in those who have appeared faith and will be a discourse for the hypocrites.So the saying of those who believe in the sense of faith appear, and it will be insulted by them at the same time [Al -Hijr: 6] So it is a speech for the hypocrites, and this is a remote interpretation because those who believe in it became like the title of those who follow the religion, follow the right, and that the one who is truly followed.For the hypocrites and the description of Islam and ask them for faith without the opposite, with the evidence of his saying, the Almighty said that the Arabs believed, say: “Do not believe, but say:” [14] It was said that those who believe in those who believe: Those who believed from Jews, such as the servant of God, Bin Salam, and he will be interpreted, enter in the sense of (P-278), the severity Religion, because they were drained from the prohibition of the Sabbath and the leaving the drink of the sons of the camels, and some of what they are accustomed to from their conditions, the days of their harms, if they are correct.Among my believing, so do so.It is permissible that what is meant by peace be here is the true meaning and the peace be among those who are commanded by God.For some as they were in the ignorance, and with my forgetfulness what was between their domes of hostilities, and the appropriateness Their fathers were remembered in the name of the pilgrimage, and they were proud of the pride that might lead to the protective, and they commanded the punishment of that in the income in the peace of God.The rhetoric of the pilgrimage, “Do not return after me as disbelievers, and some of you will be harmed by one.They were in the ignorance, and with it the verse will be in the first place in the inherent of peace for Islam, and it is the raising of the journey as the Shatby said, that is: the fighting, and what is meant to me, Peace be upon God, with God The meaning of the metaphor: That is, enter into the peace of God, to follow his orders and abstain from his ends, as the war is released on disobedience, with a sacrifice, so they said: And his Messenger [Al -Baqarah: 279] and in the hadith that narrated by Al -Tarmahi, “Whoever is normal for me, I have given his permission to war.” And (all): a name that benefits the surroundings with the parts of what he described, and it is in the image of its formulation as the form of the name of the active from the palm of the palm, but that is an association in the form of the man He needs to cost the occasion between a picture of its memorization and between its intended meaning in the words of the little serious of that, and it is beneficial to the benefit of the conservation of affirmation.And the abandoned by it is a mandate for it in all the conditions, so that it was confirmed by feminine, whether it was or a memorial, and a collection, and the one who fought, and the one who has been fought, What is used (all) in the words is that it is a state before it, as it is here, and it is all of it as a state The confined to the words on the fifth side of the fifth chapter in the remembrance of the situation from the actor and from the verb: that (all) if it is used in the sense of the sentence and the one who is not It is upon him, and it is only a denial, nor (P-279).The Handy Al -Mughni Al -Mughni for the Imamini that he was (sufficient) as a name for the sake of the sane person and otherwise, but added in the book of Omar ibn al -Khattab to the family of the family: On all the Muslims ’money for the Muslims for every year, two waters are burdened in a way that every year”.And I know that you do not do what the Arabs did not want if the life is adhered to it in the language, but rather the followers of the Arabs in their use in their entirety, do not enter the For him, he has without him And say it and do not follow the steps of the Satan, warning of what he dedicated to entering the peace of peace that is commanded by the way of the forbidden of the righteousness of it Alerting it is that what comes from the income in peace is from the Satanic, known as it is not indicated by good, for this forbidding is either more than the one who is the one who is more What is meant by Islam is the same as the people of Islam, such as being a sign of what the souls of their fans are from the hatred of giving the world to the one who said: Do we not give us the right and our enemy on falsehood, so why do we give the world in our religion, and as Sahl ibn Hanif said on the day of two ranks: O people, accuse the people of the Lord Gandal And if we can return to the Messenger of God, then we will do our actions, and God and His Messenger know, with their flags that what the Messenger of God did, but the Messenger of God, there is no good.Lamar: He is the Messenger of God and God will never waste him, and you will warn him of them that what is immortalized by their souls from the purposes With the income in peace, if what is meant by peace is the people of Islam, and the words are in the sense and do not follow the steps of the Satan, it is a clear enemy, and there is no one in it.The words of the Almighty, O people, say what is in the earth, a good permissible [Al -Baqarah: 168].And the words of the Almighty, for if you are removed after what the sons came to you, know that God is a dear wise, who is unable You have followed the lines of the Satan, and wanted to be in contradiction to the end.And the origin of the shaved shame, that is, the forms of the feet and its movement in the place that is intended to be proven by it, and the shame is used here in the shadow of the emerging Examination of the representation; Because when it was likened (P-280), whoever does the bonds of the Satan in the body of walking on the effect of others, the likeness of what is in the way of the one who is in the face of Walking in the shocked way, and it may be beneficial from that that what the Satan is commanded is also with the house of the taught way on the way It is an acting, and it is an acting.And the evidence: the evidence and the miracles, and its coming, and its appearance, because the coming is the appearance of the person after its absence.It is coming in the condition (by) to be brought in this way of those who believe, or to the desire of the desire to speak in his acquisition if the rhetoric is for the sake Pass it.And in it is a sign that what is diverted of their souls is a great slippery.And his saying, know that God is a dear wise, the condition of the condition, and that God is dear wise, the act of know, and the intended is the knowledge of his necessity.And the dear is an act of glory if it is strengthened and is not overwhelmed, its origin is from the pride, and the words have passed upon it when it was said that the pride took it, and the cow: 206] A dear, ahead of their achievement, that they are punished, and they are not overlooked, because the dear does not escape those who intend.And the wise may be a name that is active in the rule of any power of judgment, and it is necessary that the judge of matters is from the coming of the act of the one who is the one who is a verb, and the meaning of it is the meaning For matters, I am not afflicted with the affliction, for words and Eid, otherwise people all know that God is dear wise.And to make you say it, know It is downloaded to their knowledge, the home of the number, for the bond of their running over what it requires from the initiative to the entry into religion or the violation of the rulings of the religion or from the one who is the rule The messenger was held by the Messenger.Rather, he said, after what the sons came to excuse you, and it is a sign that they must be overwhelmed by knowledge to God who revealed to the Messenger of the Prophet, Because it is not revealed by God except for a reconciliation, and there is no humiliation for the Muslims, because God is dear, and it is not humiliated for anyone, and because it is a wise man The Muslims have what is in the victory of his religion, and you have seen the evidence indicating the care of God with His Messenger and that he does not disgrace him and does not waste his command and whoever is lost from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a matter A day.“ The sincerity of the Messenger, the pride of the interpretation of the judge Abd al -Jabar indicated that the verse indicated that the disagreement with the guilt does not obtain until the time of the bay The building of the sons, not after the leaving of the sheet of the cost, because it is not excused in the numbers of the leanness if the evidence is sufficient.In the scouts, it was narrated that a reader read this verse.Because it is a richness on it.And in Al -Qarbi on the interpretation of the discussion, the same as this story to the core of the inks, and al -Tayyibi mentioned about Al -Asma’i, he said: “I used to read:” They will be rewarded for what is a calamity of God, and God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.I said: the words of God.He said: This is not the words of God, so I was alerted, and I have read, and God is dear, wise.He said: No, I said: Who did you know?He said: Oh, this is grateful, then he was cut off, and if he forgived and has mercy on what he cut off.
