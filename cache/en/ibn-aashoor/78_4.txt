The Quranic researcher will not know all the letters of deterrence and heroes for something that precedes it mostly in the words.They wonder about the great prophecy in which they are different from what is required by the question from the advanced suffering, and the heroes of what the sentence of it Teacher of the two sides.So the summary of the sentence is the fall of the answer to the question, and that was separated and it was not overlooked; Because that is the way of the question and the answer.And the words, and if it is a brother about them, they are the ones who are intended for it, so the deterrence is directed to them with this admission.The meaning: the heroes of the difference in that prophecy and the denial of the question about it, that question that they wanted to be died and the denial of the struggles, and that is what is proven by the ritual Right; Because the heroes of the denial of its fall, it leads to the proof of its fall.And the majority in the use of (all) to be followed by words that shows what it is completely and abusive; So, it was punished here with his saying: (They will know) and it is a increase in the heroism of their words by achieving that they will be certain of his struggles and punish it; They are the sciences of them after the death: the knowledge of the sacrifice of the mission, and the knowledge of the punishment for it.(P-12) And that is the act of a verb (they will know) to bless the two information, for they are when the death will see what they will turn to it, so it came to the hadeeth.His seat, and it is said to him: This is your seat until you are sent." It is one of the spiritual disclosures, and its saying was interpreted by the Almighty: to see the hell [Al -Takbath: 6] Then, to see it in the eyes of the yakin [Al -Takbar: 7].So these heroes included and after it flags that the day of the resurrection was falling, and it was included in a feast, and his affirmation of his affirmation of the ritual arrest of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been said the future.And from the merits of these people in Al -Waed, that it is a delusion that they will know the answer to their question, which they wanted to refer and the recklessness, and they portray him in the answer, and they are filled with the answer.People say: The answer is what you see, not what you hear.
