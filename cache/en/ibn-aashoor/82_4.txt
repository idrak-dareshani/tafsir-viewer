The Quranic researcher, if the sky is breaking up, and if the makers are influenced, and if the seas were dared, and if the graves were found, the same is not done and was delayed.The opening is if it opens up to a longing for what is mentioned after its attachment, which is the answer to what is in the sense of the condition, as it was presented in the first surah, if the sun is all, [1] The sympathetic sentence added to it is less than the lattice in Surah Al -Takwir; Because the shrine did not require the development of the sans, as it was required by the shrine in the Surah of Takuer, even if it is in both of them, it is required for the sneaks, but it is voracious; Because the Surah of Takwair is one of the first lights as a descent, as you knew a nose.As for the surah of breakfast, between it and between the Surah of the Takuer, four and seventy, a wall that was repeated in some of it to prove the resurrection, the penalty, and the warning, and the decree of the two Speck to softens and elimination.And (if) is a junction of the future, the meaning of the condition.The Arabs say: It is a rejection of its condition, which is erected by its answer, and it is a unique phrase.And the saying in the sentence that was added to it if it is from it is an open sentence with a chain of transmission to it with an informant of it with a chain of transmission without the verb of the verb.The estimation of deleted verbs before the names, to intend to fulfill the supporter to it and strengthen the news.(P-171), as well as the saying in repeating the word (if) after the letters of kindness, as the saying in the camel, if the sun is visited [Al-Takwir: 1].And it breaks down: it is a folded break, if the thing is made of a break, that is: a snake with a breakfast, and it is presented in the wall of the king.This breakfast: an elaboration that falls as it is called the sky, which is similar to the dome in the view of the chair, which he sees in which the crystals are walking in the heavens of the calamity With night, its name is known in the day, and its witnesses in a similar image with the consequences of the centuries, indicating the mission of what is visualized by it, then if it is made Or the wealth of an estrangement from the origin of its system that disintegrates that pattern and in which it was made of hardship, so it was a mark on the conversion of the regime that is attached to it.It is clear that this breakfast is the expression of its inhalation, too, in the surah of the snake, and it is an event that is before the day of the Baath and that it is from the Ashtarat al -Sara; Because he gets the corruption of the regime that God has established for the wives and the movement of the land, and that is required by his wife with the excitement of the crumbs and the stroke of the sailors Copy.As for the scandal that was presented in the Surah of the Takwair in his saying: If the sky is scattered [Al -Takwir: 11], then an other show that is presented to the heavens on the day of the day of the day On the day of the sky, the sky is shining with the dignity, and the angels are removed.[Al -Furqan: 25].And the excitement: the diverse of prose against the gathering and against the annexation.With separation.As for the separation in the air, the release of the prose on it is a metaphor, as it is in the saying of the Almighty: we made it a scattered vowel [Al -Furqan: 23].The crumbs are aroused to separate the bodies of their associations known in their signs, or a borrower for their exit from the circles of its property and its heavens, so it is necessary to do so, so it is necessary It was clarifying as if it was a continent, so its excitement was to dispel it and separate its community, and that is one of the effects of the subjugation of the powerful power that the regime of the world was established.And the seas is rejoicing, as it is from its hundred and its embrace on the grounds of the ground (P-172), as the water of the eye is exploded when its hole for the corruption On the water of the seas and with that spoofing, the water will be done on the ground, so what is on it and disperses its surface.And the meaning of the stumbling block: its interior flipped its appearance, and the stumbling: the mulch, and it is said: the stumbling of the enjoyment if it turned away from it.He said in the scouts: Al -Baydawi said: “It was said: A crowning stumbling is a richness behind the excitement, as a name.” Uh.And the same was transmitted from Al -Sahili.And that a sculpture is a source of resurrection and excitement, such as a bee, and a decrease, and it will be in the stumbling of the meaning of two years of resurrection and the effects, that is: it was brought up, so it was left, so it is a release, so it is a release, so it is the one who did.The decrease.And the one who was short of the language of the language is that the meaning of a stumbling block: some thing about something was stirred.And the graves were found: a state of the lands of the land and the eclipse, which was dedicated to the remembrance between the lands of the earth, because of the hollows in the case of the state of the land of the land, and it was not the case.In the interior of the graves of complete bodies and showers, if the resurrection is a nurse, as he did some of the scholars or from a separation, as he saw it, then another, then the best of the bodies is that It is divided into a separation from separation, and the mission of the bald bodies and the domain of the universe is made.And the course of the same teaching what was presented and the late answer, if in the sense of the condition, and the attachment to all of the words of the words.And this science is a seduction of the account on what the souls came and were late.And the knowledge of the souls of what has been presented and the last, after obtaining what is included in the condition of the condition (if), as it is not necessary in the rib of the crushing that is the condition Comparative to the crops of his condition; Because the linguistic conditions are causes and signs and are not up, and this was presented in the Surah of Takwir.And the form of the past in its saying: it was broken down and what was overlooked by it is used in the recipient, similar to it to investigate the exclusion of the future.And the knowledge of the knowledge of people with what they presented and the last of these conditions for those who are more than the one who is more than the one who is more than that Knowledge is as it was presented in his saying: I learned the same as it was brought in [Al -Takwir: 14] in Surah Al -Takwir.And (a soul) intended by the general in which the same was presented in the same thing that was brought in [Al -Takwir: 14] in Surah Al -Takwir.And what was presented and delayed: it is the work that the soul provided, that is: his work is presented, which was done by the first age, and the work that was delayed, that is: The last period of life, or what is meant by the progress of the initiative by work, and what is meant by the last is his interview while he left the work.And what is meant by these two blindness to the success of all what you have done and the same is the saying of the Almighty: the human being is prophesied by the day of what is in the authority of the resurrection: 13] On the Day of Resurrection [Resurrection: 1].And science is achieved with the realization of what was not known before and by remembering what we forgot to lengthen the period of time as it was presented in his counterpart in the fence in the way.This is a feast of reckoning on all the entrepreneurs, and they are intended for the wall, as it indicates to him his saying after this, but you lie with the religion: 9] For those who are righteous, and for those who have done good and bad work.
