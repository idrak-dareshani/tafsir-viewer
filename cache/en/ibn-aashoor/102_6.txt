The researcher of the Qur’an, and the hell, then they would see it, the eyes of the two signs.Because what he prevented from the dirt and the deceased deterrence, and from the diligent, affirmed to its scams, it is enriched in the same way as a question from what is monitored from this and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The hell would have been answered with a blindness to the same way.And his saying is: He will not tell the hell (if) in the sense: If you knew the knowledge of the leanness, you would be the same Because the word of the words is a form of a division by the porn by the sons of the confirmation, so this blame is not an answer (if); Because the answer (if) is the reason for the fall, so do not associate it with the nobility of confirmation.And the people of their vision of hell is a seduction of the fall in it, because the fall in the thing is that its vision is required, so it is the same as the vision of the Ja`far ibn al-Halabah al-Harathi: (P-523) ؎ He does not reveal the clouds except the son of Harra who sees the dies of the death and then visits it and confirmed that with its saying: The microscopic is a purpose to achieve the bid with the Kinnary means.This affirmation was composed (then), which is for the arrogance of my arrogance on the part of what we decided to say in it: then all of you, you know: [4] Two visions fall after the other.And the eye of the two: the lean, which is not corrupted.He memorized a sample of the truth of the pure thing, other than the deficiency or the like.And the addition of (Ain) to the Legain of Bayaniya, such as the addition of (the right) to the two to the one who says it is up to the Almighty: This is the right of the juice [the incident: 95].And the public read it to see the hell with the conquest of the foolishness.And Ibn Amir and Al -Kisa’i read it to the guarantee of the one who (I see).As for (to see it), the readers did not differ in his readers by opening the dignity.He pointed out in the scouts that these conquest verses with his saying: all you know [Takbath: 3] and the end of his saying: Ain Al -Yaqin The strengthening of the warning and the imprisonment, so it was opened with the goal of the deterrence and the alert, and then it came with a letter (then) indicating that the second warning is the first.The letter of deterrence and the alarm was repeated, and the answer is omitted if you knew [reproduction: 5] because of his deletion from the exaggeration of the vigor, and it is brought in the words of the division.This section was confirmed in another section, as these six faces.And I say an increase on that: in his saying: the eyes of the two people are sure to see it that it is stagnant and that the lean is a truth.And the saying in the addition of the eye of the lean as the saying in the addition of the knowledge of the yakin [reproduction: 5] the male is nose.
