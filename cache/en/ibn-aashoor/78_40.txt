Because the fact that it preceded a warning is known to the addressees, and the news was opened with the perception of the affirmation of the exaggeration in the excuse of the download of the way.The chain of transmission was made to support the separate guarantee of the rule of the judgment, with the representation of the speaking in the example of the innocent of what is possible Those who address are harmful if they do not take their warnings of what he warned about them, as the warning says when the Arabs after warning the enemy I am the vow.And the warning: The news is to obtain what is worse in a close future.It was expressed by the past; Because the greatest alarm was obtained by what was presented from his saying: (P-56) If Hell was online [the Prophet: 21] to the tyrants, the absence [of the Prophet: 22] to the saying of God: [Prophet: 30].And the closeness of the torment is a usual, metaphorical in its investigation, otherwise it is according to the knowledge of a long time.Like the closeness that the torment is believed with the torment of the hereafter, which is what the warning offered with it, and it is believed to the torment of the world from killing and families in the conquests of the Muslims.And on the authority of a fighter: He is the killing of Quraysh by Badr.And the torment of the day of the conquest is included and the day of two years, as it was mentioned, the torment of that is in his saying, the Almighty: God is tormented by God, and God is: A torture without that [Al -Tor: 47].* * * The day the woman looks at what was presented and said the infidel, O, if I was a dust, it is permissible to relate to the verb of taking to his Lord, and he is the one [39] Approach a linguist related to (we warn you).It is permissible to be in place of the day the spirit and the angels will be a class [the Prophet: 38] because the angels are a row of the account of the people, and the fulfillment When the woman looks at what was presented, that is, what he did is preferred, so it is a way from the custody of his followers in his location.And on both of the two years, a sentence is that we warn you with a close torture, which is exposed between the custodians and his attachment, or between him and between what he was shown from.And the woman: a name for the man; It is a female name.And the association with the woman is running over the Arabs of the Arabs in their words, so the words came out of the way that prevailed over the speaker; Because the woman was isolated from the partnership in the affairs of what it was Obtained the house.And what is meant: a person looks at the male or female, what has been presented.This is known from the readiness of the project that indicates the general associate of the men and women, except for what was specialized in one of the two classes; Because the man is the one who is involved in the tale of the speeches when speaking.(P-57) and the definition of (the woman) for the likeness of the like: the human being is in a loss [Al-Asr: 2] except those who believe and do righteous deeds [Al-Asr: 3].And the verb (looked) may be from the eyes of the eye, that is: the eyesight, and the meaning: the day when the woman sees what it is presented.And the meaning of the view of what was presented is: He obtained the reward of his work for him, and he was expressed by the look; Because the penalty is not devoid of being a visionary of his friend of good or evil, so the launch of the view is here on the faces of the face of the messenger with the relationship His Excellency said: To see their work [the earthquake: 6], and the truth came in his saying: The day: every day you find every soul that you have done from the best of the verse.[30] And (what) is connected, it was connected to the sentence offered.It is permissible to be from the look of thought, and its origin is a broad metaphor until the right of the real suffering as it is said: it is the best of the two eyes, and the one who looks at the time: The day will be seen and contemplated what it has been presented, and it (what) is on this face as an exclusive, and the verb (looks) is attached to the work of the work The woman looks at the answer to whom he asks: What did he give him?It is permissible to be waiting for his saying: Do they look at it except his interpretation [Al -A'raf: 53].And the definition of (the woman) is the definition of the beneficial sex of the ostracism.And the adherence: preaching the thing and its appeal about it.And what was presented is what he has given to the best of the world in the world, so it does not conclude with what he did from the chains, so he said: “The day you find every day It worked from bad [Al -Imran: 30] verse.And his saying: What has been presented is either a metaphor sent by the release of the hands on all the machines of the works, or that it is the way of the representation of the work of the work The disagreement in the form of the manufacturers of the manufactures in his hand, as they said in the ideal: (P-58) It is not good to make the male of the hands from the crime; Because the privacy of the challenge is without the specialization of the representative.And what was presented is the goodness and evil.It was mentioned in the masculinity of the unborn person, who said: Oh, I was dust; Because the surah was established on a warning of the mission of the resurrection, then that was the face of its specialization with the remembrance, meaning: the day the infidels wish that it did not create from the righteousness The minds associated with the parties, that is: I hope that it is not perceived and not a sense It will be the least thing than what is not aware of it, which is dust, and that is an eagerness and a delegation of what has been given from the infidels.And they were saying: (If we were dust and ships, we will be spoken), so God made their punishment with the sensation and I hope that they would be from the race of dust.The remembrance of the description of the infidel is understood from it that the believer is not like that; Because the believer, even if he did some of the swords and signs the punishment on his bodies, he hopes that his punishment will be to the naked, and God said: She worked from the best civilized [Al -Imran: 30] and he said: To see their work [the earthquake: 6], so whoever does the weight of an atom is good, he sees [the earthquake: 7] and whoever does the one who does the one who does it The believers see the reward of faith, which is the greatest reward - and the reward of their goodness on their recession in it - and they hope that the destiny is for that reward and what is not seen from the reward They are their goodness, so all of them hope for the destiny to the righteous, and God has been struck by them or for those who approach them, for example, with his saying: and on the nations of the men of the people, and they are the men of them.Paradise is that peace be upon you, and they did not enter it as they reassure it [Al -A'raf: 46] on the interpretation of its interpretations.This verse is a gathering of what came in the surah from the conditions of the two parties, and at the end of it, the cushion is rejected by the chest of the remembrance of the conditions of the disbelievers who were known to the two of the two of the two who were known.The surah has a cut in it.* * * (P-59) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of the disputes, which was called in the Qur’an and the most of the phrases (the surah of the disputes) with the addition of a surah to the disputes, to the dispute, the wound to the disputes, and to the disputes of the disputes.(Displacements) is a knowledge of it because it was not mentioned in the other.In the book of interpretation, it was inspired by the Sahih al -Bukhari and in many books of the interpreters with a wall (and the disputes) by proving the waw on the first story.Saad Allah, the martyr, said: It is called (Surah Al -Sahra) by the sake of Sahara in the vicinity of the virginity, and it did not fall.And they said: Surat Al -Taamah is called.That is: to fall into the goodness in it, and it did not fall into it, and it did not remember it in mastery in the meter of the light that is more than a name.And I saw in a journalist who is written in a line of Tansi who cursed her name (Surah and Al -Mabarids) while he was strange, because of the cessation of the municipalities in it and did not fall into it.It is an angel with agreement.It is the numbers of the sharpness and the people in the formation of the descent, and the wine of the Prophet came down and before Surah Al -Fitr.Fifty and forty people were at the fans, and the people of the koffa were six and four vessels.* * * I was completed by the proof of the resurrection and the penalty, and the transmission of the entrepreneur and its fall.And the day of his day and what people are at the time of the time.(P-60) And the vigor of the actors of the anxious of life after the hostility of the bodies.It was presented that their denunciation was sent away from their tyrants, so the tyrants were honest to them from listening to the warning of the penalty, so they became safe in the people Surrounded by life after this worldly life, by making their tyrants like the tyrants of Pharaoh and its symptoms of the call of Moses Abra, and to be given to the Messenger of God ﷺ.And the words were turned to the recipient of the mission that the creation of the worlds and the manipulation of its system is greater than the return of creation.In this, it is intended for the creation of the heavens and the earth from the greatness of the greatness of God Almighty.And it is intended in it in the creation of this world from the benefits they are wearing it, and that if the world of the hereafter is dissolved and the world of the world is determined, the penalty came on the two years.And they revealed their likeness to refer the mission by their extent, and they made them an emirate on his optimism, so they ask the Messenger of the Messenger.A question that you cursed, and that the messenger was to remember them with it and not to help her during her time They are only a part of the day.
