the verses Miracle is things that their characteristics do not appear, except by looking at the words that are fulfilled in the abuse of purposes, but the mourning of the Qur’an is revealed in the purposes of what is meant, so there is no richness The appropriateness for the savings of speech and its seals according to the incitement, and the extent of the extent of the marketing of the words, and the validity of the division, and the joke of the talismans and the separation, and the separation, Another of the art of the wiseness, the occasions of the registration, the syntax, the exit, and the return, the separation of the sentence and its connection, the brevity and the sofa, and the grace of that, which is what is returned We do not appear, and it does not appear to be a journey,

it is permissible to return to our servant, for if I go back to us The Qur’an is the appearance that “from“ the beginning of any surah is taken from the same Qur’an, that is, a book like the Qur’an, and the neighbor and the bodies is a description of a wall, and it is a righteousness, Identifying, bayyan, or excessive.It was said that all of it, and it is desperate faces, and on the whole, the

to him, from the way of the one who is the same as the one who is the same Out of existence, except that it is the reason for its fulfillment, it is the exhibitor, for the fact that the matter is for the miracle, it requires the excuse of the matter, so it is not the matter of the matter, so it is not the matter of the matter.The faces are likely to be like the Qur’an until some of the faces are

of them said: And among them who said: He is one of the first legends, and among them is those who said: Rather, he will teach him an evil.The face of the faces is in the sense of the verse It is entered into all the advocacy, if it is the words of human beings, then you will come with its likeness or the same, and if it is one of the first myths, then you will come with a part of it Bishop,

that is, in the event that you are unnecessarily, it is not necessary for God, or the state of God In the sense: Make the side of God, who descended the book as the witnessed, the witnessed to Him, so your ears have lost this to you; Because the intensity of the cushion is the rest of the reasons for the reasons for the work, and it is permissible to be (without) in a sense in front of me and between the hands of you And he was martyred for him with the saying of the east: The gun of you is without it and it is without it ∗∗∗ If someone tasted it, he will be stalled as it is permissible to

mistake and mistake, and it is enough for that and removed from his intention, and it is sufficient for his knowledge of the righteousness of the righteousness of the righteousness.And his saying, if you are sincere, are symptoms in the last words and a melody.It comes that the condition of the original condition is that it is not cut off with its fell, because their sincerity is not the improper
