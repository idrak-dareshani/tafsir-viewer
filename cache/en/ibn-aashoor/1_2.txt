The Quranic researcher (P-152) Hamd for God is in the speech with an important matter that was not preceded by the addressee of him, a speech from his type, to be insulted by the one who has been given to him.To receive it, and to be luxurious to the hearing of that and to consider itself to be fulfilled by doing it to do so that it can be prepared to meet the abandonment of all the things Inclusion with the obedience of stubbornness, perseverance, or the abuse of the mind with the lost and lost.The rest of the stubbornness and faders, and the ransom of its adults is the demolition of the devils, so when God wanted to be this surah, the first way is the glorious book.The nose, the alert of God, presented the readers of his writers and the conquerors of his companions to the origins of this soul, the soul of what they have believed to be able to start with it.Al -Fateh Surah from his saying, “Nabad” to the last surah.It includes great origins: the first of it is the disturbance of the disruption and the partner with what it includes, “you worship”.The second is the abandonment of the devices of the exploitation of it by the righteousness from the around and power in the direction of its greatness with what it includes “and you seek help”.The third is the desire to be guided by guidance and deduction as it guarantees, “We guided the straight path”.The lighter is the desire to dissuade the goodness of what it guarantees, “the path of those who have been blessed with them.” The fifth of the delusion of peace from the delusion is frank with what it includes, “it is not angry with them”.The sixth whispering in peace is their thinking from the mistakes of the falsehoods of falsehood, which is stated in the images of the truth, and it is called the misguidance, because the misguidance is the mistake of the one who made it wrong.The lost, and if you missed the success of the guided by his guidance and the guidance in his reception of its many, and its sponsorship, and its grandfather, it is a certainty around this one, Be in a pocket.May I increase you from detailing it.And the one who has codified the people of the Qur’an in what is in the gathering of the righteousness of the guidance with a face that is not surrounded by the knowledge of the unpiniteity.The blessing is the right of its ability to thank it, so they see them as how they crowned their needs in Hamd and the wilderness of the mind and the grant of success.Therefore, the opening of all words that were important to the timed was the Sunnah of the glorious book.(P-153) Fateh Al-Fatihah with what is decided by the Qur’an from the Dibajah for the book or the submission to the speech, and this is the one who has a greatness in it.Arabic literature, which is the dedication to understanding and claimed to the creator.The fabrication of the Fateh was drawn for the two young people, three barriers to the submission: the first base: the briefing of the submitted, so that the whims of the Samaids are not dictated With the length of waiting for the intended while it is an apparent in Fatwa, and to be a year for the speech, so they do not lengthen the old so that they are not attributed to the eyes, so it is in the place Infusion, and from this, the face of its place appears before the long light with it that it is a short wall.The second is to refer to the intended abuse, which is called the consumption of the insults, because that prepares the smiles to hear the detail of what will be returned to them, so that they will be rejected, so that they will not be.If they are from the people of the reception, then it is calculated, or let us be able to do it and entrust it if they are in that cervical, and because that indicates that the fiancé can be able to do so In it, in which the smiles are alerted to his consciousness, and there is a year for the speeches to surround the purposes of their words.The Bayyan of the conquest of the conquest of this was presented to this when the words are on the face of the name of the Qur’an.The third is that the presenter will be from the words of the word, and this is between the scholars of the Bayan at their remembrance of the positions that he will be given to the word.The lighter is to open up with the praise of God.The Qur’an is a guidance for people and a show for the rulings in which people will be given in their urgent, their lapse, their pension, and their return, and for what was not for the mother of the mother Therefore, it is necessary for those who address it to receive it, and they are known to be inspired by their convergence.With his beneficial teachings, and that is to repeat their souls from stubbornness and perseverance.And from mixing their acquaintances with the strokes.There is no advice before it is the ruling on that wisdom and the view of the slices in the name of the virtue and the abuse of the vulnerable.The conquest includes a survivor for the universal creation, which is the discontinuation, union, and foreclosure of what is included in his saying (the king of the day of the day) You include him, “We worship you, and we seek help”, and about the perseverance and stubbornness of what you include.Confronting the need to science, and describing the path to the straight, a confession that the knowledge is what is true and from it is what is confused with a similarity, and the one who is a matter We himself to follow the best of them, and about the misguidance that the correct sciences and the truth are the truth, so they go with their benefits (p-154) and the owner of the owner of the owner He stood at him with the ignorant, and that is what the saying of it (other than the angry on them or the lost), as we have a closeness.For this time, this was called the Surah, the mother of the Qur’an, as it was presented.And when the believers were embraced by his creative sponsorships that are not guided to surround it in his words, it is not the knowledge of the unseen, the praise of the It is upon it to put it as the survivors, as well as in their requirements, running on the way of eliminating the Arabs when addressing the greatness to open their speech to them, and they are overlooked by them Beautiful.The mother of the son of Abi Al -Salt said: The servant of God, the son of God, is praised by the son of God.It was subjected to praise, and it was the opening of the words with the timing, the year of the glorious book, for every glorious way, so the Muslims remained from the day of the day.He did not comply with his luxury on the praise of the righteousness, taking from the hadith of Abu Hurairah from the Prophet ﷺ “Every matter that does not start in it with the praise of God.” The speech of Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan, whom he had spent in the beginning of the insight, was nicknamed because he did not open it with praise.The surah of Al -Fatah was for that, a house of the Quran, the Dibajah for the book or the introduction to the speech.Therefore, there is an important thing in the creation of the creation, for the presentation of the submitted between the hands of the intended is the dedication to the understanding and the claim to its awareness.And praise is the praise of the beautiful, that is, the beautiful, sealing description, as it was like the generosity and the relief of the anhoff or otherwise like the courage.And they made praise for the praise for praise, so it is better than it and it is not against it.The remembrance of the remembrance is good, and the one who uses the praise is used in the remembrance, even if there is an evil, and it is attributed to the son of Al -Quta’a and his deceit in that is what he said.You have been good for him, and the paradise was obligated to him, and for whom you have a evil for him, the fire was obligated to him.A Muslim, let him speak with or to pray, so he called their remembrance of evil (P-155), alerting him to that.As for the one who uses in good and evil, it is the femininity of the presentation of the noun while it is in evil more as it was said.As for the praise, it was different in it, so the crowd went until the praise is better than the praise, so it will be on the eternal description and otherwise.The owner of the praise and praise said the brothers, so he said that the brothers wanted in the great derivative, the rituals and attraction of the It is necessary to appear to be his words that the praise is called praise on the beautiful, but this is an understanding that is not stranded and who is the one who has the right From the brotherhood here is the synonym because it is the back of his words; Because he is a good saying in the horizon of praise is the praise and description of the beautiful, and because he mentioned the defamation of the praise for praise, as he said in the scouts, “and the praise of the ritual The universe of the sacrifice of the praise, and the knowledge of the scholars of the language to want to the contradiction The opposite is not what is equal to the contradiction until it is answered that he wanted from the contradiction that does not collect the meaning, and the vilification does not collect the praise, even if it is not meaningful, raising the meaning of the meaning Praise; However, the denial of the bottom, which is the praise, is obligated to the exile of the sacrifice, which is praise, because this is not intended by the scholars of the language.Zahir: Whoever makes the known one other than his family ∗∗∗ He praises him with a defamation of him and delegates because the words of the scholars are based on the dumplings.Then he disagreed with the goal of the owner of the scouts from their sympathy, whether they are overpowered in their piety with the birth of the choice, or the synagogues in the enemy, And on the first, the honorable master was carried by him, which is the appearance of the words of the religion of religion, and the master was inferred that he was stated in that in the saying I said that the Arabs praised the beauty and the good of the faces, which is a praise of acceptance at the people, I said: He who was justified that they have seen the goodness of the Lord, and the good It travels from a sick and ethnic ethics, on the authority of the investigations of the stories and the scholars of the suffering who paid the validity of that, and the praise of the praise is made with it Goodness, and it is like the eloquence, the courage, the justice, and the chastity, and what it feels for it.And on the second bearer, which is that it is a intention of the extension of the enemy of the choice in both of them, when the investigator, the servant of the wise, was carried out in the sake of the sake of the Performing, based on the fact that he appears to be his words in the scouts and the high, as he canceled the arms of my choice in the interpretation of the praise of the beautiful and made them with them.(P-156) With this, the forms of God be exalted, may God bless us, as well as the knowledge of God, without the attributes of the verbs, even if it is the ritual of the one who is the one who is the one.For what is stated to them is that their peoples are obligated that God does not exalt his attributes because it is subjective, so do not describe the choice, as the choice is the choice, They answered him, either by that of these high attributes, the hose of the choice was descended to exclude its descriptions, or that the arrival of the choice is the same as the choice of the other Either by the fact that the choice is that the Hamid is active by the choice, even if the Hamid is not a choice.And when the answer is to say: The condition of the choice in the truth of the praise is when it is proven to take the attributes other than the choice, because it is not for the other.Al -Kamal, as the effects of Hamid are not arranged on them, so the seal was in our Hamda, an increase in the achievement of the Hammud, either The uniformity of the eaten with the divine attributes, it is not expressive of a deficiency in his attributes, but it is as a talisman that arose from the grace of the righteousness of the sake of the sane.So the choice in the attributes of God is the highest increase in the fullness, because the proverbs of those attributes in us do not be a duty of pleasure for them, so the numbers of the seal were in the end of the seal in the adjectives On the increase in the fullness, and we have an indication of the deficiency, and it was not a lack of us with the adoption of what might be as a blame for God Almighty with other admission to the same as the abode The download is either by adopting the adjective or by adopting the descriptions, for the praise of God to God Almighty with the heavens of Hamad is the best of what is called the language of the man If the family of that language, when the path related to the high facts were attached to them, he expressed to them the best of their words.Praise be to all the narrative readings, and his saying “to God” has told him, so God is attached to the universe and the general stability is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Here is the source that came instead of its actions in the sense of the news, so the setting was originally on the verb that is released on the authority We praise Hamd to God, so that they will be deleted with her with her.Sibuyeh said this is the chapter on what is erected from the sources of the act of the verb, other than the uses, its purification, and that is what you say, the watering, the catering, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, the caution, He does not need a comment, and as for their saying, it is a way for you to be watered and sponsored by that loyal adultery, but it is to show the meaning of the supplication.Then he said after the chapters: This is the door of what is erupted by the perpetrator of the action, which is the emergence of the sources in the other than the supplication, from that, your saying: Hamad (p-157) Wonder, but this is the same as the act of the verb as if you said “Ahmad al -Hamad”.That is in the chapter on supplication, and some of this came with a ram that begins with it, then it is built on it, that is, to be told of it.Then he said after another chapter: This is a chapter in which it is chosen in which the issuance will be a woman who is built upon it after it, and that is what you say, and for you to God Repeat the lifting in it because it has become a definition, and it is a news that is not created, so it is strengthened in the appeal, meaning that it was when it was a supplication and it was a known for it As it is in the sense of the news, it prepares the side of the meaning of the expert, and it is a definition, it is correct to be starting with the house of the servant of God, and the man, and the man, and the man, and the man, and the man, and the man, and the man, and the man, and the man.Because the appetite is a good news If a definition is unanimously and denounced, it begins with the knowledge, which is the origin of the words.And there is no letter, that is, an installation that is made by that, as it is not every letter, that is, any word of these sources, in which the thousand and the one who will be entered, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a thousand For you, it is not permissible, meaning that it is in which it is listened.He knew that praise be to God, and if he started it, he has the meaning of the text, and it is a replacement from the memorization by your saying: God is the rest of God.We have heard people from the Arabs a lot, saying: The soil is for you and the wonder of you, so the interpretation of this is the same as its interpretation, where it was a disgrace, as if you were: To you to show whoever means me and did not make it a building on it and start it.The words of Sibuye ended with a disagreement.Rather, we have grown here because it is the most correct words of the phases of this source in the words of the Arabs and their resignation, and he is the one who the owner of the scouts referred to him.Its action is that it is a source that the Arabs install with a reactions that are guaranteed in the sense of news, such as their saying, thank you, disbelief, and wonder, and they will be revealed.And they lid with it, and for that, they do not use it with it, and the entirety of it is from the text to the lifting of the way They change from the original, except that they throw to a suppression, they are just for its sake, and the enemy from the text here is to raise them so that they will come to them with the seams of the day.And the significance of the general public in the place of the gender, and the significance is the one who is in the midst The source is erected, as the monument indicates the estimated action, and the estimated is like a chapter, so the sentence is not a nominal, as the name is a deputy (p-158) The actual estimation is not the permanence.That is, and it is a language that is a tampering, as Sibui said, so the curiosity is then that it is not indicative of the generally of the al -Mahamd, because if the verb is destroyed, then the verb is the same The timids of speaking without the pimples of all people, and if the verb is destroyed, we are Muhammad and I want all the believers in the village of the sake of the And with the two villages of you, we worship [Al -Fatihah: 5] The ignorance.On the authority of Hamid That he is steadfast to God, and every praise is blessed as it will come.This is the meaning of what we have said about his Sibuyeh that he said: The one who raises praise is told that praise is from him and from all creation and who is erected that he tells him.He knew that the reader of the monument, even if it is anomalous, is that it is found here because it indicated an Arabic advertisement in the evolution of this prestige, and that it is the best of the Arab If the definition did not forget the origin of the relevant effective.It was lost that his saying “Praise be to God,” he informed of praise be to God with the setting, and that praise be to God with the setting and the defamation of the most important of God.Rather, praise for God was the most generous because it is indicative of permanence and steadfastness.He said in the scouts: The enemy is from the text to the raising of the significance of the steadfastness of the meaning and its stability, and it is the saying of the Almighty.The significance is that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, lives with them with a good greeting of their greeting.If you say: The endowment of praise is with the fact that the remembrance of the name of God is the most important, so the affairs were to present the name of God Almighty and the righteousness Its change from the position to lifting it for this time, I said: The praise is presented because the place here is the shrine of praise, as it is the same as the first of the blessing The Qur’an in which the success of the two house Its danger when he listens to his removal and his recitation of his recitation, recalling what he has attracted to the beautiful attributes, and that is reminded of his loud On the authority of it, the place was the place of Hamad, not a referral, so this was presented and removed from it what was authorized to delay his deeds (P-159).Then, that is the fulfillment of it, the adoption of the fulfillment of its presentation, too, to the remembrance of God, to be more than the murmur of the praise in the place of the absence in It is the same because the exhibiting norms are presented to the original norms because it is a matter that is required by the position and the situation, and the other is required by the occurrence, and the rhetoric is the case.And the position, and because what was not fulfilled by the exhibits is the need to be angry at his knowledge, as it may be hidden, by the disagreement of the well -known matter, and there is no extension in the righteousness of the The alerts are fulfilled by others.If you say how it is correct, as the time of the praise is the beginning of the praise, and it is the beginning of the prayer, and it is the basis Delay.I said: If this is a peace, then the meaning of its presentation is the intention of the speaker To come to him, it is presented with it as a delayed; Because the elimination of two formulas is two of the two skilled in the praise of God, the Almighty, “Praise be to God” as in Al -Fatah and Al -Akhari “to God Hamd” as in Sora.As for the intent of the general, it will be clear when the meaning of the definition is in it.And the definition in it with a thousand and the worse is the definition of the ends, because the source is here in the origin of the verb, so it is not a crime that the sign is on the verb and the one who is the same If the mother enters him, then he is to know his significance, because the pain indicates the definition of the name, then if the name is an angelic, then the imam is not.And the meaning of the defamation of the race is that this sex is known to the Samaid, so if you say: Praise be to God or the wonder of you, as if you want that this gender is not for you and for you He is confused with others, as if you say “the man” and you want to be appointed in the definition of the gratitude, then you want that this one of the people is known to you Like denial, from where the gender is not with it, it is not the same, as the gender is appointed from the rest of the fools, and it is a remembrance of the word, and it is a good.Other than him; As other than the sexes are not with a share of him in the memorial, nor the condemnation of his entry with him in the address of the addressee with the disagreement of the devotion of the exaggeration of the exit of the exit of the exalted Between you and between your addresses between the rest of the people who are covered by the word, so this is not beneficial to me, the meaning of the genius is only to be disturbed by the spectrum For Samaa; Because you (P-1660) when you made it with a tree, you have indicated that it is clear and visible, and this requires the acquisition of the sex and its approach from the well-known, and this is the good The scout, which is the same as the definition in (whom it is sent to the fight), and the indication of what is known to each one that one of the facts is that the praise is what is and the fight is what is between the segments of the verbs, which is from the words of it.And the lameness of the curiosity is here for the darkening of what you knew that it was the mother of the spectrum, and for that, the owner of the scout said, “And the suddenness that the one who has been distracted is from the people of the people The suddenness is here by example, because the judgment is to take the end of the soul of the praise with it, the exalted to the existence of the mother of the purpose of the gender in its saying (praise) The blockade of praise is required to comment on the name of God, the Almighty, because if the gender is concluded, the individuals are concluded.Let the gender achieve in its ascetic, so the meaning of the bond is not fulfilled from the mother of the one who is the one in the name The palace Al -Adawi for the Great.And the blame in his saying is the Almighty to God, it is permissible for him to be the one who is the one who is a claim that he has passed as it passed, and it is permissible for him to be the piety of piety.For the weakness of the worker with the sponsorship, and the integrity increased it with weakness, because it is the same as its likeness to the verbs, and the meaning of the eternal is not missed because it is the one who is the one.This has been violated that the sentence of Hamid is a news or creation, because that is more related to the interpretation of its hurry to the meaning of the saying of the saying.The gathering of the saying in that is that the construction may obtain the transfer of the compound from the experience to the creation, and that is like the dormitory of the contracts, like the one who is bought, and I was bought, And the hope is as good, yes, and misery, and this is the last one of it, what is used to create with the meeting of its expansion in the news, and from it what is specially specialized, then the first is the first You use a news that says that the house of the house is made to the increase of the one who told you that it was called me (P-161), so this is a news, and you say: I am the house of the house, or the house of this In two villages that he came to martyrdom or a cows to support the news of the addressee with the fact that the expert is a state of his conditions, and the second is as a blessing and perhaps.If this is decided, then the scholars have disagreed that the sentence of “praise be to God?” Is it a news about the evidence of the praise of God, or is it the creation of a praise to Him, for the sake A news, and these are two of them who claimed that it is a remaining news on the expertise, and there is no notice in it by construction, and it was mentioned that the one who speaks to it is not for it.He praises and praises God Almighty, and it is answered that the news is the determination of praise for Him, a condolence that he is described by the beautiful, as the praise is the eye of the way, The description is from the people and the speaker is transferred.It can also be answered by the fact that the news is inside the general of his news at the public from the people of the origins of jurisprudence.It is also answered that the universe of Hamid may obtain commitment from the news, they want that it is necessary to know that the matter is the matter It is in it in it other than those who know it, so the people of the one who speaks that he knew that is the knowledge of a knowledge that he is in the face of this Many, that is: it is like a matter of the abandonment of the news stated in the knowledge of the suffering, the same as your saying: you are the best of the night, and you want it, and you want it, and you want it, and you want it.It is not necessary that this be a creation because the appreciation is on this saying that the speaker is told about his being Hamid as it is told about the whole of the people of the None of the creation, and it is beneficial to it with the way of the obligation Another news means.It is also responded to this estimated that Hamad Al -Mutifi becomes uninterrupted by his own self, but rather he has the following with the fact that the shrine is the place of Hamad, not People, and it is answered that the remaining meaning may be brought to him for the sake of the obligatory meaning because it is a means of it, and its counterpart is the saying of the long and the ritual of the ritual Najd brought him to indicate the meaning of the height.A second jurisprudence went to the fact that the sentence of “Hamid to God” is a news that is not referred, except that I want to create with him with the experience of the expert (I put it as a female) and the saying of Jaafar ibn al -Harithi al -Harith It comes with the mediation of the news from the significance on the domination, the seamility, the inhabitants, and the steadfastness, and the direction of the obligatory between the news from Hamad al -Nas and between the creation of the praise in the The obligation on the first report, but here it appears because the expert from Hamad al-Nas (P-162) for God Almighty is not a criminal that it is created for the sake of God.In Al -Kiniyah, it is the intended without the remaining meaning, it appears from it in the adoption of the acute experience, because it was covered in Al -Kinaya, that it is not a good thing that I want to do with it.The origin is with it, so it indicates that the original meaning is either what is intended or intended, because it is "with" the entry into the vou.The second gold is that the praise of the praise of God is a pure creation, not a notice of expertise, on the authority of the formula that the Arabs have said from the news to the news of the news of the news of the news, to the goodness of the news to the goodness of the news.The contracts and the verbs of praise and the vitilization, that is, a transfer with the numbers of the death of the expert meaning in the recipient; You may say praise for God as an answer to whom he said: Who is the praise?Or who is Ahmad?.But the covenant of the original meaning is weak, so he needs the presidency.And the truth that is not neutral is that the praise is for God that is used in the creation, so the intention is the construction, not a referral, and it is amended to the expert.It is appropriate for the majesty of the Hamid with it from the significance of the permanent, steadfastness, expulsion, and the choice, and the blame, and something of that is not possible to collect it with a form God praised, and what indicates the Arabs' adoption of it is a creation, not a news, the saying of the tumor: ؎ And when it was running in the reward, it is as if it is the reward of the reward for it On the remembrance of the memorization of praise or the thank you for the events, and the events aim to create a language, so we say it, we have told him what he crossed with what he crossed, and he is the one Terrorism in the wood.And God is The name of the obligatory supplies attached to the whole of the al -Mahamd.The origin of this name is the God of the Evidence, and it is the definition of the god who is the name of the sweetener of the servants who are derived from God with the conquest Or he dwells, dispersed, or swallowed what is returned to a meaning that is obligated to subjugate and glorify, so it is an act of breaking the fulfillment in the sense of the same On every idol of their idols because they see their truth in worship, and for that, they gathered it on the gods of the lord of the verb with the reaction of the second.And I count that his name is a decree in the language of the Arabs before the entry of (P-163), the angels in them, so the origin of his place was indicative of its rituals with his righteousness, not for him.So, he became a flag on him, and that is not before the flag of prevailing, but rather from the flag in the siege like the sun and the moon, so do not go in the way.And he was a flag, and for that they wanted the servants with a right in response to the people of evil before the entry of evil in the Arabs, and we did not stand on that With the imam, unique to one of their idols, but they add, and they say: God is the sons of Fols, and most of them are to say: Lord, the sons of Fassil, or they will be as a whole, as they said: The gods, and in the hadith of the Makkah, and the Messenger of God found the God in which the gods are.When the gods have sealed the single God, and the provision is required, they derived for him from the name of the gag with a flag in a sign of connotation that it is true to this name, especially the name of the name of the name Launching it other than the Sunnah of the personal flags, and see them creative and marveled when they made the same knowledge of the same, derived from the name of the Golden, the morte On the authority of itself, the same is not invoked by the one who puts the science, and he is the first heat of this name from the family Creator of all, so they deleted the hammer from God for the many sorrows of this memorization at the significance of the Almighty, as they deleted the people of the people, so they said: Therefore, they appeared in some words.Al-Bahath ibn Hareth said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ؎ The loads are to call ∗∗∗ on the safe people and we have come down to this third brightness in the third place To a new look, and they make it like a new science, and this method is marked in some flags.Abu Al -Fateh ibn Jinni said in the explanation of the saying that is a evil in the second praise of the third of the thym.It is for the son of the uncle of the charity.Scientific uh.And in the scouts in the interpretation of the surah of my father, a flame, after he mentioned that from the readers who read my father to a flame of the universe of the distraction, what he stated, and it is from the absence of the flags as the one who is the same With the guarantee, uh.And he said before him and Fulta Bin Qasim Amir Makkah, one of whom is the servant of God with the rugged thus.Uh, it means breaking a slave in all the conditions of his expression, for this gesture is a special type of science, which is that it is stronger than the flag in the dominance of the one who has a goodness, because it is a good thing.Glorious.This is the way in the scientific that was presented to the name of the Majesty, and we do not look at it in the flags, so its name was the highest, unimaginable to the names of the testes, as well For the names of the names of the junction.And they have been referred to them in the thousands of people, and that they made them part of the word with their vocabulary, calling for the name of the majesty with the beginning With the fact that they call the entry of the entry of the thousand and the blame.The owner of the scout was brought up to the origin of the god of God with the house of the submissive, and they did not decide his views and the face of his need for him, and he is the one who has been broken.You did not respond in their use of an addition to the name of the majesty, such as a grace, so the pilgrims were made in their obligation to the addition of the added, when you say: The God of God is the one who is true of the people of the tongue, that they are considering God as the origin of God, and for that this was not the same as the behavior that he changed in.The one memorial, such as the disagreement of the performance of performance with the universe, is not the one, not to see that they took it (P-165) that God is afraid of God with the saying of the one who is the one who is the one Your uncle, you are not preferred in the account of me, and you are not in me, so you will store me and their saying to you, your father, because this is what is required of one case, for you to say to your father, and they will say to your father And to God you.And the most recent faces were mentioned in the origin of the name of the Majesty: from it that his origin is a source of export to him, he will follow him if he is forced, and he is called God, and then he is the best of God The original glimpse is like the virtue and the glorious one, and this face mentioned the jewelry on the authority of Sibuyah that it is his possession.And from that, his origin is with him with a verb in the sense of an effective one, if he was confused, then the waw fell as a gossip for the healing of the fracture of it, as well And a scarf, then it was known for the thousand and the blame, and the gossip was deleted.And from that, his origin is in secret.He was Arabized with the deletion of the thousand and the inventory of the mother.And from it that it is a science that was placed in the name of the majesty by the first intention, without taking from God and his visualization of God, so he will be his approach to the image of the one who said: However, he said, and he said that the gathering of them is the gospel, and it was attributed to the cell and its Siphi, and some scholars directed him that the Arabs did not delude it.How to come from them as a name for them to be exalted, so that his attributes will be traded.The time for the sake of the majesty may be disturbed by his mother, if he does not break what was before his memorization and tried some of the writers, you will bring him so that he does not The scouts are on him, so he said, and on that (i.E.: the fools) all of them, and their kindness is upon him, and that they have inherited it as an old man.Rather, the chain of transmission was not provided, and it is included in the name of the majesty on the chain of transmission to him, so he said: God has praise; Because the supporter of it is Hamid on the download of the Qur’an and the honor of Islam, and they are from God Almighty, and he praised him for them when he was in the absence The two households were the place for the insurrection of it as the most common Hamid, and if the remembrance of God is the most important thing, then the exhibiting norms are presented to the righteousness.The position and the situation.The rhetoric is the demand for the requirement of the situation.On the authority of the praise when he was commented in the name of God, the Exalted was in the fulfillment of Him, and he was fulfilled by the affairs of God Almighty.(P-166) And it is a matter of views that the owner of the descriptive recipient mentioned in the explanation of the recovery from the whole of the scholars who say that the name of the majesty is in the way And to stop the words in it on the past.* * * The Lord of the two worlds and a description of the name of the Majesty, then after he supported the praise for the same name He is attached to it also because the attachment of the attached is stuck as well.With his descriptive investigation also to Hamid, as he deserved it.Four descriptions have been conducted on him, the Lord of the two worlds, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the king of the Day of Religion, for the permission of the description of the description, then the remembrance of this is the remembrance of this With adversaries, the intention of noticing its original suffering.This is one of the beneficiaries of the words of the way of following because it was in the remembrance of the description of the rich of the remembrance As well as his loudspeakers, and he was also mentioned by the descriptions, as well as a richness in the alerts on the verge of praise, the intended of the sentence, that we know that the one who is the one Among them is only, and it indicates that both signs of the description and the adjective are very serious by hanging praise for him.With what is in the remembrance of his disciplined descriptions of him from the memory of what distinguishes it from the shining gods with the nations of the idols, the two and the support The Lord of the Day of Religion [Al -Fatihah: 4] and the Lord is either a source or a liquidation is similar to the weight of an action from his Lord who raises him in the sense of his Lord, and he is the Lord of the Lord.And the rabting is the way of the thing to its aspiration, and it is permissible for it to be from his Lord in the sense of his king It was a similar adjective on the two causes, and it is a few in the weight of the likeness of the likeness.The hadeeth is his sleep, so it is a nam for the hadith.The appearance is that he is derived from his Lord in the sense of his Lord and his politicians, not from his Lord in the sense of his king, because the first is the best of the place here, as it is intended that he is the arrogant and the one who is the one Entity is like her money, and because if he had been carried on the meaning of money, his saying was after that, after that, the king of religion [Al-Fatihah: 4] as the affirmation and the affirmation of the disagreement of the Except that it is answered that the two worlds are only included in the worlds of the world, so he needs Bayan that the king of the hereafter is as it is the king of the world, and if it is the most in the words of the Lord, the Lord is the Lord of the Lord And the master, and that who called the scout to the limitation of the meaning of the master and the king, and he brought in it and the sides of the export, except that the two villages of the denomination The memorization of the most of his resources to his pregnancy on what is without it, for both the recipients are a true and virtuous martyr, and the exhibited repulsion is from the place that is not Seek it in that sense in all of the events as it is not hidden.And the Arabs were not summarized, the Lord was memorized with him, not divorced, nor restricted by what you have learned from his weight and his detection.Al -Harith ibn Halza said: They are the Lord and the martyr on the yogurt of the two caliphs, and the rally means Amr ibn Hind.Al -Nabah said in Al -Naaman ibn al -Harith: “You are disappointed until you get it.God is the best of its makers ∗∗∗ and he had a victory for the wilderness and the owner of the scouts and whoever followed him said: He did not call otherwise The recovery with its disagreement, but its release on each of their gods, then there is no murr His head ∗∗∗ Han was the one who has the cinnamon and the heavens of the attribute of the Lord.And his collection On the ears of a sign of its release on a number of people, so how to correct the pretext of specializing in its release at them with God Almighty.As for its release, adding or related to a special, and his arrival with a lot, the Lord of the House, the Lord of the Persians, and the Lord of the sons of Fols.He also returned the release of Islam, as well as he told him, peace be upon him.Those who are good are good [Joseph: 39] This is a launch of the Lord added and unlike added, other than God, the Almighty in Islam, because the word is an Arabic, and it is released in Islam, The memorization was not released.The hadeeth is forbidden to say one of his master (P-168), my Lord, and let him say: my master, and he is forbidden as his perseverance to discipline, and for that, the forbidding of the forbidding is what was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is added Knowing the names of people to pay the accusation of the tradition and cut off his dubbed and they have been allowed to say the Lord of the Daba and the Lord of the house, but by release, then he will be seen.This is a Lord.And the two worlds are the collection of a world.Glory be to and the hearing, the hearing and its poems, and the world of gender is one of the gender of the stations, and the Arab daughter was based on the weight of an actor by opening the eye from the one who is from the knowledge of the knowledge He has a distinction from others, so he has a mark, or it is the reason for knowledge of it, so it is not mixed with it.This construction is specialized in the core of the machine, mostly as a gesture, and a fool, and they made the worlds to make it as a machine for the knowledge of the sakes, or the knowledge.And the Arabs were created in this gentle, as they were the name of the gender of the jesus on the weight of an act of an act of this joke, and they have come when they were gathered from it.It is not a sane to be a sane.Al -Tafizani said in the explanation of the world, the name of the knowledge of knowledge and for every race that the Creator knows, the world of the king is said, the world of human being, the world of the plant does not want it In addition to a variety that is devoted to it, the world of human beings is said, the world of plants, the world of plants and is not a name for the group of what it is, so that he will have a procedure for him, so he will be done, so he will be a good It is not found in the words of the Arabs to release a world on the whole of what God Almighty, but he released him on this of the scholars of the words in their saying the world is a sharp one.And the definition in it to seek to be a category of discourse, then if it is not a conqueror and it is not a meaning Liegna on the truth, nor on the careful, the custodian, the definition of the darkening of all the individuals is a motivation for the control, so it will be tempted by the slander of the honesty of the honest On it, there is no referral, and it is the meaning of the saying of the scout, to include every sex from what he called for, except that the exploitation of the gins is obligated to seek the abuse of the people, not the one who is clear.It is intended for itself, especially in the place of judgment on the parliament.Rather, the world gathered and did not give it a single because the collection is a verse on the exposure, because if I was unique, he would not be aware that (P-169) is what is meant by The collection was a matter of expulsion, and this is the Sunnah of the collection with the (the) exploitation on the investigation, and when the gathering became a verse on the one who is a verse on the one who is a verse on the authority The meaning of the groups, so the exploitation of the crowd was equal to the obstacles of the paradoxes or the comprehensive of it.And the hero of what was common when the followers of the silence are from their saying: the expulsion of the individual is comprehensive, as we will show it at the saying of the Almighty, and the knowledge of Adam: [31]
