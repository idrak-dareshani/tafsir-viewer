The Quranic researcher who believe in the unseen is to be a word connected to his saying to those who are righteous that it is a row for the purpose of the row of the sake It is intended, and it will be with that the principle of a bound to support the types of people, according to the disagreement of their conditions in the delivery of the book that is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the authority Before the migration, two years, they were before the migration, a believer, and the insufficient kindness, so that they were disbelieved, so the migration increased, and it is the rituals: The two partners are the first of the first Islam, and those who escaped appeared in the city, so they were brought up with the first ones who were left by the Muslim, and the Muslim is in the hands of the It is concerned about the confrontation of the admission of Islam, so when Islam erased in the city in their neighborhoods, they were afraid, so they would see with the hypocrites and appeared.It was indicated that the believers who are righteous are the ones: a group who are the righteous who were confessed to those who were entrusted and the Qur’an was guided by the same.The one who is connected to the other connected to his saying: “Those who believe in what has been revealed to you [Al -Baqarah: 4].”.Etc.The one who is the one who is here is those who were partners, so they heard the Muhammad al -Muhammad, so they managed to survive and fear the punishment of the evil They sent them to Islam is piety without the amplification or the experience, the loyalty of the son of a stone, for example, what came from the Yemeni who desires in Islam, he is one of the righteous, and the one who is the one (P-229) The children of Hanifa, the guarantee of the vigor in the king, is one of the righteous.Another jurisprudence comes to his remembrance of his saying, and those who believe in what has been revealed to you [Al -Baqarah: 4] The verses.These attributes have been conducted for the best of those who believed after the righteousness that their arms to faith were piety and view of the punishment, and for that, and for them, and that is the right of it After that they disbelieved in the mission and the repetition, as the Qur’an narrated from them in many verses, and therefore it was overwhelmed in the luxury of them with these three prayers The extension of their faith is the extension of their faith in the unseen and the renewal of their establishment of prayer and hypocrisy, as they were not described by that, unless the Qur’an came to them.The owner of the scouts has passed as a beginner, and it was a beginner, and it was “those who were guided.” He told him.And when it is permissible for what is not met, as the argument requires the resignation from exhibition to another, and it is called the opposite, but it is good in the rhetoric, if the rhetoric is the first, if the first is In it until I am tired or even the pain of the Samaid, and that is signed, either after or the word of this and the like, otherwise it was short The book of the book is more wide from the speeches Because the prolongation in its purposes is possible.The absence is a source in the sense of the unseen, so that he knew that I did not betray him with the unseen [Yusuf: 52], so that God knows who is afraid of the unseen and may God said: A righteousness from the family of Lam, with the appearance of the unseen, comes to me and in the hadith, “The prayers of the believer to his brother with the appearance of the unseen are admired.Sleeping that he is a reality or will fall like the presence of God, his attributes, the existence of the angels, the demons, and the weapons of the hour, and what God has taught.If the absence was made by the source, that is, the absence, the B for the crying was a stakeholder, and the description is exposed to the hypocrites, and if it is the one who is unjust, and it is the absence The high and the other worlds, the Ba was attached to the believers, so the meaning is then: those who believe in what the Messenger of the Messenger is like the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of The resurrection and the spirit and the like.And in the hadith of faith (“To believe in God and His angels, His books, His Messenger, and the last day and believe in the ability, his best and evil”).And this is all of the nations of the absence, the description was an explicit of the polytheists who denied the resurrection and said: Do we show you on a man who predicts you if you are torn Jeddah [Saba: 7] This description was collected by the fragrance, praise for the believers (P-233 They believe in the back and they are insecure, and this expression will be followed by a slight and their description in his saying, that those who disbelieve themselves, whether they are the ones who have disbelieved themselves, [6] And his saying, and from the people who says: We believe in God [Al -Baqarah: 8] and believe in its meaning, they believe, and the security of the security is safe, and the more is the same.The security of the security against a fear, so he believed in it, he made otherwise safe, and then they called the safe meaning of charity, and he narrated that the father of Zaid is the one who is a good.If the traveler is late for travel, then he believed in the sense of charity on the estimation that he believes that his expert The news of the news is free in the security of the thing as a matter of thing in the sense of which he came to him and baptized to him, then he became a short verb, either on the observance of the slander The recovery in terms of the verb is the obligatory, or on the observance of the malevagant, that is, the security of the security has any of the doubt and the obligatory The meaning of security and the tranquility is closely They say that they believe in him For you [Al -Baqarah: 75] and the coming of the connection of the connection is a verb that is in the way of stating that their faith is a steady and renewed as you know a nose, that is, he does not dare to believe.He specialized in remembrance of faith in the unseen without other than the comments of faith, because faith in the unseen, that is, what is absent from the sense is the origin of the comprehension of what you tell the one who is informed of the Lord Al -Alawi, if the woman believes in him, he will confront to hear the call of the Messenger, and to look at what he informs him of God, the Almighty is easy for him to know the evidence of the evidence.The world of materialism is another world, which is beyond the pillow, so it was satisfied with the symptoms of the supplication to the belief in the abandonment of God and the world of the last as the state of the materialists is With the ears who said, and what is destroyed by us (Al -Jathiya: 24), and the close of their intentions, the perception of the entrepreneurs, and that worshiped the embodied idols, and they were the most important of the Arabs.They prove from the absence, the presence of the Creator, and some of them prove the angels and do not believe in the level of that.And the words are on the truth of faith, this is not subject to it, and it comes to it with the words of the Almighty, and what they are with the believers * * * * (p-231) and they will make the prayer of the prayer, Entrepreneur with him with the significance of the sentence, and the residence made it standing, taken from the market, if the people are spent, and the people are spent in it, and this is the good and the purchase of this Surveying some of the people of the tongue with this estimated.Ayman ibn Kharim al -Asadi said: ؎ The deer of the market of the Drink for the people of the Iraqis was established around a dummy and the origin of the rhetoric in the language is the antagonist of the opposite and the opposite of the man The standing is the intent of a difficult act that does not come from the lords, so the sermon will be established, the worker will be established, and the chants will be established, and the cattle will take place.It is a matter of its obligatory symptoms, and therefore it is made a metaphor on the activity in their saying, he did the matter, and from the most famous, this metaphor is the saying The war, and they said, against it, and it slept, and it is beneficial to everything that is related to it, which is appropriate for its metaphor's activity, and it is from the metaphor of the messenge So it is like the truths, and that is true by building the second metaphor and the slogan on it, for the establishment of the prayer is a sense that is similar to the perseverance of the prayer, and the goodness of the prayer, And I think that you are attached to this action with the prayer of the Qur’an, and the Qur’an came with it in the princes of its descent.We came down.The owner of the scout remembered his faces other than the arms of the verse.He crossed here with the harms as it was located in his saying, they believe in order to reconcile that for those who established the prayer while they are the ones who believed Before the revelation of the verse, and those who are in the righteousness of the prayer and who are those who believe in the coming of the verse, and those who will be guided to that and they are those who come to those who come It is good for all of that, because whoever does prayer in the past, then he does it now and tomorrow, and whoever does not do it, then he either does it now or tomorrow and all the sections of this vein are the one who made the Qur’an.To them.He has obtained the benefit of the hard-working horror (P-232), affirming what was indicated by the material of residence from the perseverance and the release to be praise for them.And prayer is a rigid name with the weighing of the act of the perception of the eye (prayer), and this memorization in the words of the Arabs in the sense of supplication is like the saying of the east: The father of the injustice and the goodness of you, the same as the one who prayed, and gave up ∗∗∗ Jafin, for all of the women are destroyed and repeated in the sense of worship in the sake The milli is a wardrobe and a visionary.Ibn Faris said that the Arabs were in their ignorance on the inheritance of their inheritance of their fathers in their languages, so when God came to the Almighty, they were conditions and transferred from the places With the increases, and from what came on the prayer of prayer and they knew the kneeling and prostration, even if it was not on his authority, the napstel said: ؎ or a dirham of the friend of it.It is seen and prostrated, and this is like that, so that the Arabs did not know him with the same as the law came from the numbers and times.I said, I did not doubt that the Arabs knew the prayer, the prostration, and the kneeling, and God has informed the Almighty on the authority of His Excellency, peace be upon him.They pray, that is, their worshipers come with a special woman, and they called them a prayer, and the Christians were among them while they prayed, and the naps said in the remembrance Al-Ghosani: The father of his prayer with a ghostly eyes ∗∗∗ and Judyr al-Julian is a belief and a pioneer (P-233) on the narration of his prayer with a significant hunter who wanted to be the one who wanted to be the one who wanted to do the prayer The priest and dread, as it was victorious and the previous house.And know the prostration.Al -Naba’a said: ؎ or a shocking dirham, with a glow when it sees it, and it is glorified, and the imams of the language will be repeated in the detection of the prayer, so he said: A thicker sweat in the middle of the noon and divides at the wonder of sin, so he will be cured, so he said, then they are a prayer That race was derived from the prayer from it, as they say, nose such as if it is smelled with his nose, because it raises it if it is tired And he drew, so it is from the derived from the universal, as they say the camels and their saying, so that so -and -so, and the saying of it, “My husband, if he enters, then he will be guided.” The detence here is the same as the one other than it, so it is not possible for it to be weak for the sake of the few who derives from the aspirations as the master is delusional.Rather, it was released on the supplication because it is obligatory, the fear, the eager, and the humiliation, then they derived from the prayer that is a rigid name, may God’s prayers be upon him, and the prayer is made.Distinguish the prayer of the Persians if he came punishing the journey in the horse of the milk, because he comes with a crowd for him in the precedent, and put his head on the authority of his predecessor, and he is the one For the second paradise in the horse of the milk, and this opinion is in its detection, it is fond of their words, which is the one who must take care of it, as it is not reconciled to the origin of its origin.And what the pride is in the interpretation is that the pretext of detecting it from the two prayers leads to a great stab in the costume of the Qur’an, because it is not the reason for the prayer of the one who is more than the one who is more The two prayers move you from the distance of the things, as it is between the people of the transmission, so if it is permissible, it is hidden and that it is taught until it does not know it except for the one who is the same, so it is not the same.We cut that the meant of God is up to the Almighty from this conservation of what is destroyed from our understanding in our time, this is to involve that it was in the time of the Messenger, a place of time.He wants it that there is no prohibition from being a famous memorial from a hidden means because the lesson in the shyness is with the recovery, and the detence is not.The good and the purity of this memorial in the second sense with the numbers of its purity in the first, does not praise its transfer from it.(P-2334) It supports that it is derived from this writer in Waww in Al-Muharaf, as if not for the significance of the sign, it would not have been intended for what was missed from it, what was the face to write it, and they wrote it and they wrote it.And life with wow indicating the original.As for the saying of the scouts and its writers in the wow on the memorization of the fool, that is, the language of the fool of the mother, it is wanted that it was not done other than the lamb.And the source of his prayers, the roses, is a few of the roses in their words.Al -Jawhari claimed that it is not said to pray and follow it by the Viruzabadi, and the truth is that he responded with a few in the transfer of a fox in his hopes.The prayer was transferred in the tongue of the law to the subjugation with a special form, a special supplication, the readers, and a number.And the saying that its origin is in the language of the supplication and the subjugation, it is close to the legal sense and agreed with the saying of the judge, Abu Bakr, and whoever follows the exile, and the one who follows the authority of the Shariq.It is only used in his linguistic truth by guiding the conditions that only accept it.The disgraceful facts said The legitimacy is a subject with a new position, and the entrepreneurship of linguistic or metaphors.The owner of the scouts said: The Sharia facts are metaphors that were attached to the causes.The truth is that the statements of the sayings return to the existing partitions in the legitimate facts.* * * And from what we have agreed upon, they spend a third link in the description of the righteous, which achieves the meaning of piety and the faith of faith from the custodian of my dear in the soul in the pleasure of God Because faith, when his headquarters was the heart, and his tongue, the tongue was needed by the evidence of his friend, and she is the bones of the works.They believe in the unseen.And that is generous by making money for the poor, in compliance with the command of God with that.And the sustenance is what the human being gets from this world, which is clogged with his warnings and needs and obtained by his mourning, so he will be divided into everything that he gets in And the wilderness, the animal, the diligent tree, the clothes, and what is done by that of the two critics, he said, and if he attends the division, the first of kinship, the hosteli, and the poor of the women.[8] That is, from what the deceased left, and God is simplifying the sustenance of those who create and appreciate [Thunder: 26] and rejoice in the worldly life [Al -Raad: 26] and he said in the story of Qarun: His saying (P-235), and that God is the simplification of the sustenance of those who are offended from his worshipers and appreciates [Al-Qasas: 82] intended to live with the Kanwaz of Qarun and he said, and if he said: They wanted to the earth [Al -Shura: 27] and the most famous of his recovery according to what I have seen from the words of the Arabs and the murdes of the Qur’an that it is what is obtained from that for the human being, and what is for the sake The animal is from the spray and water, so it is on the metaphor, as in the saying of the Almighty, and there is no bear in the earth except God, its sustenance [Hood: 6], and he said, and he found it.It comes as a food that is provided with it [Joseph: 37] and the provision is a law at the people of the Sunnah, such as the livelihood of a language.And the forbidden is that the adjective of the solution and the forbidden is not the same as it, so the permissible of the forbidden has other places and does not accept God except for goodness, and that is good.Like alcohol and merchants in it before its prohibition, but what is meant is that they spend what is in their hands.And the disgraceful in that in the Friday of the Pharaohs of the Creation of the Corps and the Prayers and their estimation, and the question of the sustenance from the questions in which the views of the view in which the views were run Ash'ari and the disgraceful as the question of the deadlines, the issue of pricing, and the dislocated assignment in the sustenance question with evidence that does not produce the required.The spending is given to the sustenance while it comes back With the benefit of the soul, the family, the children, and the one who desires in his prayer or the approach to God with the benefit of him from food or a dress.And I want it here to broadcast it in the benefit of the poor and the people of the pilgrimage and the supplies of the servants of the Muslims with the Qur’an of the praise and its assistance with the faith and the prayer, so there is no doubt that there is no doubt Complete faith, and it is nothing but spending in the path of good and public reconciliation, as no one is praised by his spending on himself and his dependents, as what is called to me With the urbanization of it; From spending is what is obligatory and it is a right to the owner of the livelihood, for the relative and for the sake of the nation and the nation’s birthdays, such as the purpose of the gossip and the zakat, and the bone of it It is imposed by the lawful reconciliation or the need, and that is detailed in the success of the lawful rulings in the books of jurisprudence, and from the spending, it is the one who is in the authority The debt called for its benefit.And in his chain of transmission, he did our livelihood to the guarantee of God Almighty and made his acts who believe that he alerts him that what becomes the sustenance is for his sake May God bless him with the ruling of the validity on the behavior of the causes and the means that the angel of the people is determined by the money of the money and the missionary, and it is the question of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Consisting with her companions and exciting them with the reason for the effort from what the woman did with the strength of his religion, which is not bitter in that it is the right of it as the water of the water (P-236) And the hunter and the sin of the garment and the risk of what is not the king of it for anyone, nor is it a being in the king of one, and the same as its servants with his strength from the boundaries of the jurisprudence and the walker And the confusion of the proceedings, or what is made of things from the materials that he owns and has the right to intend for it, such as bread, tissue, trading, and the narrowing of the Hadid, Now from the clay of the fakrum, or from what it produced like the place, the cultivation, and the birth, or from what it is noticeable with its mind, such as the learning, the goodness, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, the abuse, and the abuse, The lawyer, the judiciary, and the part of that of the wanders and the construction that the public or the private, or from what the money gave him a livelihood of gifts, gifts, and commandments, or ears, or the ears of The dead, or from what he received by the opposition, such as the signs, the rents, the chandeliers, the parties, and the magisis, or from what happened to it from the money that his owner has made it like the right of the people.The cat owns after the custody of the conditions, and the right of the fifth to the pillar.This is what the saying of God is the Almighty, and what we have given to us, and not for anyone, nor for the group of people, right, while God has made it to the one who is the same He did not seek to receive his means, and Handy came to the daughter of the husband of my father, Safyan, to the Messenger of God.Miss, who is spent from the one who has our dependents, and he said to her, but only with the well -known, that is, except for what is known that he is in which the wife is in it from what is in the house of what is in it.That is without a path or a trait.And the progress of the work operating on its workers as it spends the extent of the extent of the provision in the knowledge of the people, so it is in the adherence to the time of what is permissible For the grace of the soul on the soul, as the Almighty saying, and they feed the food on his love with my sponsorship, the continuity of the verses on the letters of the noun, and in the noun, and in the one who is in the noun, and in the noun, and in the one who is the one who is A gesture to the one who is required to spend, is the spending of some money because the law did not cost people embarrassing, and this some say and wrapped in the affiliation.The duty of it is what the project has estimated its position and its amounts of zakat and the agreement of the husbands, the children and the servants, and what has increased on the duty does not connect its limits, and it is not more.The Muslim is required, what he was tied and acquired to the hand of others.Rather, the choice of the remembrance of these attributes to them without others, because it is the first thing that was made of Islam, so the slogan of the Muslims was the full faith, the establishment of the prayer and the prayer of the prayer The groups are two sisters in many of the verses of the Qur’an, and because these attributes (P-237) are the evidence of the salvation of faith, because faith is in the case of absenteeism from the believers and the state of the believers On the one who is in the sky and the salvation, when the fear and the bond will be fulfilled, if what is meant is what was absent, or because faith is not to reach the sense of a sign of a sign of the power The street is what is not before the opinion in it and the soul of the souls is to deny that it is faithful to it because it tends to the sensual, so faith in it is upon its ills, and it is the same The Messenger, if what is meant from the absence is what was met with the testimony, and because the prayer is a minimum cost in the stories that its residents do not remember, that is, the best of its performance is only the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one On its subjugation and the purification of the slave, and because the zakat is the performance of money and the knowledge of the scarcity of the souls, the Almighty said, and if the good touched it, it is a variety [Al -Maarij: 21] and that the believers were Those who are hidden from them in the event of evil with the disagreement of the people of the book, so its remembrance was reminded of the prestige of Islam.
