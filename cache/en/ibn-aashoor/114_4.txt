The researcher of the Qur’an, I seek refuge in the Lord of people, the king of people, the God of people from the evil of obsessions, which is whispering in the breasts of people from paradise and people.She was young, her opening is the opening of Surah Al -Falaq, except that the Surda Al -Falaq is a tenderness from the evils of the creatures from the animal and the people, and the surah of the people is a resort from the evil of the evil Throne.And the saying about the matter by saying, and in the saying, and that the discourse is for the prophet ﷺ, and the intended is his nation, as his saying in his counterpart in the wall of the clips.And he (Lord), with his addition to people without others, was given from the two rackets; Because the recovery is from an evil that the Satan throws in the hearts of people, they are misled and misleading, so the evil that is refined from it is infected with the people, so it is appropriate to bring the argument With the title that he is the Lord of those who throw evil and those who receive them to disagree with these, and he will be defended from the others as it is said to Mawla the servant: O Mawli, so The descriptions of God have arranged for people to people, as a dedicated formula, for God is their immorality, then they are not outside his rule if he wants to do so, he will be in his rule Bayan with the description of (P-633), his divine to them, to show that his grapes are for them and his rulers, in them, they are not a carbure.Some.And in this prohibition is also a notice of the attributes of the view in the knowledge of God Almighty, for the view is announced with the beginning of the beginning that he has a Lord with what he feels from him And the blessing of his installation, then he is overlooked in the eyes, and he feels that his Lord is the king who sings the rich of creation, then he knows that he is the right All of them.And the king of people is a kind of people from the Lord of the people, as well as the God of the people.Because the compassion of the Bayan requires the emergence to be the clear name (by breaking the ya), and it is independent of itself; Because the Bayan was composed with a house of knowledge of the clear name (openness).And people: the name of a collection of good news, or a group of them, and it is not called, otherwise they will be rejected.And Al -Waswas: the one who speaks to the souls, which is the hidden words.A vision said, describing a friend in his murder: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ With the same woman from the phases that they are deluded as a word that he speaks to himself.Aroudah ibn Utnah said: If you find it for it and the descendants of the authority of the hearts, the hearts of the guerrillas, then ask for it and the definition in (Al -Waswas).Its metaphorical and true meaning includes the demons that are thrown into the same people of the evil and the evil.It speaks hidden words from people, They are the owners of the angels and the intended imams from the harm of the souls, the stealing of money, or the seduction of misguidance and symptoms of guidance; Because some of these are the same as some of them with some to be a secret, so that those who want to rhythm do not arise from it, and they are the one who is the one The circles and deceived people with their harm.(P-634) and Al-Shanas: the severity of the seed and the many.What is meant is that it has become habitual.And the whispering and the puff: the severity.And the Satan is called (Al -Khanas) because it communicates with the mind of the human being and his determination from other than the feeling of it, as if it is a sequence in it, and the people of the deceased, Because they live in the people of people and seek the types of life for a whole, people feel them.The curiosity in (Al -Khanas) is on the weight of the definition of his Sufism, and because the evils of evil are concerned with her owner, so he will be drowned, hesitates, and he is afraid of her rituals, Or he is removed by the religion, the living, or the fear of punishment for God, or when the people, then he will return it until they reassure it, and he will be satisfied with it, and he will be satisfied with it.As if the Satan looks out for him, then he is afraid, then he looks at him, then he will be afraid until it can be able to deliver it with vanity.And the description of obsessions is the whispering of the people of the people who are in the ritual of the bosses of the boss, so that the woman will fear it if it is accustomed to its hidden, and that it is for it to be hidden, The place of the bossy is the breasts of people and their homes, and he expressed the psychological sensitivity as he said: “But the hearts that are in the breasts:” 46 Except for the oldest they are in the rhetoric [Ghafir: 56].And the Prophet said ﷺ: “The sin is what you are in the chest and hesitated in the heart.” Effective communications, souls, as a result of the preachers of the devils, and the prophet has brought them closer ﷺ in many effects of many types of approach from them (that it is like a slave that extends to the heart) He likened it once to the junction, and once with the basis.In the hadith (“Satan runs from Ibn Adam, the blood of blood, and I was afraid to slander in your hearts”).And the reaction of the verb (whispering) on ​​this Satanic action is metaphor, as the Satan has no words in the interior of the human being.As for his release on the inclusion of the human being for others, it is a truth.And the course is related to his saying: in the breasts of people with the act of whispers with the lineage of the whispers of the Satan People are a mental metaphor; Because the whispers of the people are due to the impact of its effect in the breasts, so it was in each of the verbs (whispers) and its attachment to the expansion of the two righteousness in the truth and the metaphor.(P-635) and (from) in his saying: From Paradise and People Bayan Who is whispered in the breasts of people that he is an angel that is dissolved by administering the will of his truth and his metaphor to two sinks: it is a kind of paradise, and it is the origin of it, and it is the origin of it, and it is the origin of it.For the first class, and God combined these two classes in his saying: (Likewise, he made us for every prophet as an enemy of humanity and heaven, to show some of them.Women [Al -Anam: 112]).And the face of the pilgrim to this Bayan is hidden from what the human beings are carried out; Because the nations used to warn them, the reconciliation is from the whispers of the Satan, and perhaps it is not dangerous to mind that it is obsessive that is evil from the obsessive of the two devils, and it is the authority The most dangerous, and they are the same as the most generous, because they are close to them, and he is more dangerous, and that they are in the means of harm.It is not evaluated to be (from) a bayan for people, as the name of people is not called what hengs, and whoever claims that is a distance.And it was presented (the paradise) on (people) here because they are the origin of obsessions, as you knew about the disagreements The devils of humanity and heaven [Al -Anam: 112]) because the liability of people is more mixed with the prophets than the teeth; Because God has fasted his prophets from the authority of the demons on their souls.He said: My servants do not have a authority for them except those who follow you from the people [Al -Hijr: 42], for God wanted to inform his life for his prophets, and he will be blessed.The devils, and they did not disobey them from the harm of people with them, and the good for them to weaken his danger, he said: And when he denys you those who disbelieve you, or who will be disbelieved, or they will disbelieve you They come out, deny, and deny God, and God is the best of the Macrin [Al -Anfal: 30], but it is a guarantee of his messengers who are saved from all that is cut off to inform the message.Heaven: The name of a ghee gathered in the water of the proportions to the types of heaven, for the single gin is from the types of gin, as it is said: a human being for the one of the human being.And the word (people) is replaced by these two first verses of the two verses, with one of the most prominent meaning in the place of guaranteeing the intention of the confirmation of the Lord of God For all of them (P-636) as the Almighty saying: They have their tongue with the book to calculate it from the book and what is from the book [Al-Imran: 78].As for the third time, it is the third of it: in the breasts of the people, it is a demonstration for the sake of the dimension.As for the one who is repeating the one who is the fourth of his saying: from paradise and people, because it is a bay of one of my loyalty, which is whispered in the breasts of the people, and that is not the same (People) in preceding times.And God suffices us from the evil of the two parties, and we will benefit us with the righteousness of the two.The Surah of the People was interpreted, and the great Qur’an was interpreted.Muhammad al -Tahir, Ibn Ashour, says: And I came with what I had intended, and God achieved what I wanted, so I have forgotten what the effort tolerated from the two suffering of the Qur’an and the rituals of his regime and the characteristics The sayings of the imams, and refer to from the urbanization of the lighting of the thought and the domination of the body, and I have come with what I hope to be in it for the sins of the people of the truth Perhaps it has gone a face and did not leave it, because this is an attribute that does not reach the human mind to his completeness, and whoever Rami has lost Ram and Al -Jawza.And the words of the Lord of the people are true that he is serving an endeavor to the head, and this right has performed only the penis of the interpreter who seeks to the Qatas He was imprisoned at the costume and the germ of the dirt, and when he came to complete, he had the right to prejudice.The time of this interpretation was the same as the day of the second group of the month of the year of the year of eighties and three and a thousand, so the period of his etc.Moreover.It is a period that was not devoid of a shifting work, and the other books of its artists, and a ritual, and a ritual, with a clear, phanting, p-637, and a deserted wrath, And the conditions are evident, from what is not abandoned by the generations of generations, and no disbelief for God, because his blessings is enough, and the measures of his grace to me are neither nor wrap And they hope that this interpretation is to be found and overwhelmed, and that the private and the gathering will benefit from it, and make me with it from those who hope that it is a merchant.And his mammal was in the country of Marsi, the city of the city of Tuns, and Muhammad al -Tahir wrote the son of Ashour.
