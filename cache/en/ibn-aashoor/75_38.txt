The Quranic researcher (did you not seek a sperm from me, and then it was a relationship, and he was created, so he made it so that the male and the female of the male and the female are not so that it is a matter The reason and the bays of the denial of the market to the one who says it (that is the human being to be left [the resurrection: 36]) who has been made and a good and supported ( The human being will not collect his bones [the resurrection: 3]), that is, the creation of the human being from a weak material and its reinforcement in the phases of his two aspects is a sign of evidence of the destiny of the second one The separation of its parts and its compassion, so the meaning of the words is called: so that the human being is that we will not collect his bones and prepare it as an excuse.We are softened, then his creation is evident, so what is meant by us to restore his creation secondly, as well, he said (as we began to be the first creation: It is a gift to his saying (not that of this is a measure of the dead).This is on the authority of the other meaning that his saying (Saday), that is, he left him with a penalty on his bodies, because he is a good life to be rewarded for his work.He left Vana and does not find his life.The resurrection is from the subject of the material, so it was a combination of integrity.Females, for the one who is able to create this creative creation, is not incapable of returning the creation of each one as it created it first time with a verdict and a thorough one.And the sperm: the few of the water called the water of the reproductive, and it was presented in the surah of a pierce.It is mentioned in the books of the language that a verb: Mona or a mother is called in the sense of a bone except that some of the people of the language said in Temaya (Mona), which is the one who is the same The blood of the guidance is buried with it, and they were not shown, whether it is a repeated act or the prodigy of the preparation.To miss the flags while it is the cost of wounds, so the name (Mona) is a flag, and Thalab said: I was called with that of their saying: God bless him The gifts and the same from the son of Shamil and the son of Aynah.The interpreters are the harbinger of the man of the man, so it will be like his saying (you are.What you wish [the incident: 58]) in the surah of the occurrence.And the relationship: the small piece of the complex blood.A verb (was a relationship) was composed with a letter and then a sign of the arrogance, because it is a relationship that is more liked to be a sperm because it was a water that was a water that was a water that was a water So he mixed with what the merciful of the female is sorted from the floods, so it was from their enthusiasm, as it was presented in the extension of the piety with the saying of the ritual of the ritual [Star: 46]).(P-368) And when his formation was a relationship, it is the beginning of the creation of the body, and his saying (he was created) was kind to fulfillment, because the relationship is that it is a punishment that it is a punishment that it is the one who is punished.The creation of the body and the breath in it.And Zayda (creation) is based on (your Lord).Likewise, it was composed (so -and -fulfilled) with fulfillment.And the settlement: make the thing together, that is, a standardized justice said: “So they settled seven heavens [Al -Baqarah: 29]” and he said: “He who was created, so he was” Greatness and flesh.And the act of (creation) and the act of (Suwa), who are deleted to the words of the words to them, that is, he created it and its equality.This was punished by his creation, or the female of Zawajin, and from whom the reproductive is also.And he read the jams (Tana) with the discretion that it was a description of (sperm).And he read it to Hafs and Jacob with the time that he described (Mina).And the sentence (Is there not a limit to revive the death) and the satellite of the resental satellite is from the evidence because the creation of the body of the human being is a good thing, and it is a good thing, and it is a matter By receiving the return of life to the body after the death, whether the nomadic is not deficient or a shortage of it or its greatest, then it is the same as the life of it, then it is the same as the life I am close to finding the body from a number.And the understanding is a denial of the denial of the consequences of confirmation, and this is the majority of the extremist understanding that it falls on the negation of what is intended to be proven to be the same as that On the decision, if he wants to deny the trust of the one who speaks that the addressee does not seek denial.And he came in this conclusion with the good response of the cushion on the chest, because the surah was open with the denials that the partners reckon with the sake of the Baath, and the words of the words, Of the trusteeship, the supply, the script, and the recipient, until it is led to the conclusion that God is able to revive the death, which is the one who is required to be presented in the saying We gathered his bones [Resurrection: 3] Yes, Qadir, to forget his Lebanon [Resurrection: 4]).And the death of the death in his saying (Is that unable to revive the dead) after the rituals of the words of speech on the special people of the disbeliever or the disbelieve The sentence (is that with a limit to revive the death).* * * (P-369) in the name of God, the Most Merciful.The Messenger of God ﷺ Surah (did he come to the human being [Man: 1]).Al -Bukhari narrated in the chapter on the reader in the dawn of his authenticity from Abu Hurairah, who said: “The Prophet ﷺ was reading in the dawn by (the pain of the prostration) and (did he come to man [1].The owner of the vengeance was confined to the name of this surah (Surah Al -Human) when the remembrance of the mac and the civilian, and he did not remember it in the meter of the one.(Surah Al -Duhr) is called in many of the Qur’an.Al -Khafaji said (Surah Al -Amahj), because of the memorization of the workshops in it, and it was not included in the Qur’an.Al -Tabarsi mentioned that it is called (Surah Al -Abrar), because there is a remembrance of the righteous and the righteous and mentioned them with this memorial and I did not see it to change it.(P-370) This is five names for this surah.And he was disturbed in it, it is a place, and it was said a civilian, and it was said that it is an angel and some of it is a civilian, so Ibn Abbas and Ibn Abi Talla and Quta’i, who is the one, Ibn Masoud said that he also arranged it in his journalist, while Abu Dawid narrated it as a relative will come.And on this, the greatest of the phrase, and the fabrication attributed it to the fans.Mujahid narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas: that it is a civilian, and it is the saying of Jabir ibn Zayd and was told by Qatada as well.Al -Hasan, Akrama and Al -Kalbi said: It is a civilization except his saying (and do not obey from them a sin or a disbelief [man: 24]) to the last, or his saying (so be patient) Etc.It was not mentioned that these verses from any surah were prepared in Mecca until the human surah was descended in the city, and this is strange.They were not appointed that in any surah was read.It is more correct that it is an angel, because it is the same and its suffering is running over the Sunnah His love [Al -Human: 8]) I came down to the food of Ali ibn Abi Talab in the city of the city of the night, and the last time, and another captive, and it was not for the one The memorizer is a prisoner in the sense of the captive of the war, or what was narrated that it was descended in Abu al -Dahdah, which is my supporter, and many of what they carried the coming of the verse on the example of it With the reasons for descending as it indicated it in the fifth presentation.Jaber bin Zaid eight and the nineteen in the formation of the descent of the light.And he said: I came down after the Surah of Rahman and before the surah of divorce.This is running on what he saw as a civilian.If the most correct is that it is an angel, taking the form of the son of Ibn Masoud, then the thirty or the thirty and the thirty and the thirty and the restriction of the rituals of the rituals or the one who did not come to the authority of the ritual As long as he responded in the formation of Ibn Masoud.Abu Dawood narrated in the chapter on the homes of the Qur’an from his Sunnah on the basis Masoud said: “The Prophet ﷺ was reading the two wounds and promised a light.Abu Dawood said: This is the release of Ibn Masoud - that is, the referral of his journalist - and the ordained people agreed on the promise of any one and thirty.* * * (P-371) Its purposes are reminding that every human being was after that it was not, how would he make up for the re-formation of his formation after his numbers.And prove that the human being is sufficient for the individuals of God with worship, thankful for his creator, and warned against the trace of it.And the evidence of the part of the two cases in the right thing with something of that part of that part of it and the sofa in the description of the parts of the Shakrin.And I am integrated through that gratitude for people with the grace of finding and the blessing of awareness and the gratitude of what the human being given from the distinction between the good and the goodness to the good and the goodness to the good It is among the people who thanked the grace of God, and among them who disbelieved it, he worshiped others.And the Prophet ﷺ was proven to do the burdens of the message and the patience of what it cares about in that, and warning that they will be informed of the disbelievers, and the indication that the ritual of the ritual A greatness that God deserves to be subjected to what he chose for him and to accept his worshipers.And the matter of accepting the remembrance of God and prayer in the times of the day.
