disgraced in the world in the world.A great kindness on the authority of the Christians, and the Christians are not the Christians.They say this and what is presented by injustice, nor the shadow of those who prevent the mosques of God, and this is a breaking and falling between the remembrances They received the call of Islam that came to their guidance and their grapes.And the verse is descending in the Arabs of the Arabs, as in the narration of a gift from Ibn Abbas, which is required by his saying, those who were not to enter it, except for those who were disobedient.It refers to the prevention of the people of the Prophet ﷺ and the Muslims from entering the Mecca as it came in the hadith of Saad ibn Muhaaz (P-679) when he entered the Makkah and said: Ignorant, and I will see the house safe, and the boy has been given, and this was repeated in the year of the Hadaybiyah.It was said that I descended in the king of the king of Ashur and his conquest of the holy house of three conquests first in the year 606 before the Christ, the king of the king, A group of the people of Israel.And the second after two years in which the heads of the kingdom and the king are in the authority of the kingdom and the king, Kenn ibn Yahwiaqim, and the mosque is destroyed by all of his gossip.And the third after one year in the time of the king is true, so the king was familiar with the king, he wore his eyes, and burned the mosque, and the whole of the city, and the cubic The Kingdom of Yahouz, and that is the year 578 before the Christ, and this is called the third captive In it the name of God and causing it in his horse.It was said: I came down in the conquest of the Romanian Tattas of Oroshilm, 79, before the Christ, and he raised the house of the sanctuary, and burned the teeth, and he blessed it.The Muslims after the opening of the Shami country.And on these two narrators, the two narrators do not appear suitable for its remembrance of what was presented, so it does not want to build interpretation on them.And the face is the identification of the first narration, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the authority of Ibn Abbas.And that this is a shiny of origin in them with everyone who came to them with what violates their whims, and he had indicated that the participants are young in that in that when they say: The book, nor the participants, to be revealed to you from the best of your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 105] The words are composed to the Bayan of what you are separated from the numbers and the impartiality of the partners, the coming of the Qur’an, so the Qur’an is in the Qur’an That is not the same as one of them before them, as they prevented the mosques of God, and they clogged the way of guidance, and they took place among the people and between the vision of the mosque, the forbidden of them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the forbidden And this is the case of the student of the goodness of creation, but this is the one who is the stubbornness.The questioning was the denial of the denial in the sense of the negation.(P-680) The darkening shadow over the right to be narrated in it is what is not satisfied with it, and it is called the place of the thing, as it is worthy of it.Rather, they were the injustice of people because they came with a wondrous injustice, so they wronged the Muslims from the forbidden mosque, and they are the most right of the people with it and they were unfair to them.And the mosque collected, and if the participants prevented the kaaba, then it is either for the greatest, then the gathering comes to the greatest, such as the words of the Almighty, and the people of the Lord, as well as the people.We burned them [Al -Furqan: 37], either because of the places of worship, which is the house, the mosque, the forbidden, and the place of Abraham and al -Hatim, or when it is connected to it, too The mosques and the addition to this face in the sense of the era of the covenant, or the intention of the entry of all the mosques of God, because it is a group of people in the view It is in the sense of negation to include the return every sacrifice for a mosque or a forbidden from worshipers by giving it to the establishment of worship and enters the partner in that The judgment of the roses of the public on a special reason, and the addition to this direction in the sense of the mother of exposure, and perhaps the guarantee of the gathering, which is based on its saying, “that he enters it.” The mosque is a mosque that is known that this is the return that does not exceed for everyone who prohibits a mosque, as it is a minimum punishment that does not obligate its frameworks in the proverbs.It is intended to prevent worship in its special departments with it, such as the circumambulation and the group, if it is intended to prohibit a hateful person from those who are qualified from it.And there is no shield from the mosque in other than the group’s gatherings, because the prayer of the feat is not preferred in the mosque, otherwise, and it is its closure from the entry of the sake of the sake of the sake Ibn Arafa was asked in the interpretation of this interpretation of this, and he said: The chapter of the mosque was closed in the places of the prayer, and it is preserved.Likewise, it is forbidden to be entrusted to his entry, and the Messenger of God is prevented and the pilgrims and the pilgrimage and prevent the ownership of the infidel from the entry of the mosque.And the pursuit of the origin of the walk, then it became a metaphor, which is famous for the excluded captivity, such as the Kervian truth The explanation is directed: I have ended in your need, for prevention here is a truth about the first narration presented in the causes of descent and the pursuit is a metaphor in the causes of the other Metal.As for the two other narratives, it is permissible and the pursuit is a truth, because it is a mockery and a shed does not prevent anyone from the remembrance, but they are in the absence of So I would like that to prevent and to him.(P-681) And his first saying that they would not be entered by it except for the disobedient sentence, which is a question that enriches a question arising from his saying, “Whoever is hurt” Because if he knew that the actor of this is the oppression of the people or the hearing of this woman, and it is the pursuit of the analogy, it requires the reward of those who describe you or this.It is permissible for her to be symptoms between “whoever is darkened” and his saying to them in the world is treacherous and the signal is “those who are“ after that the three descriptions are made to them.Come in those descriptions to tell them after that indication of their informing people of their guarantee of what you are presented in the first of you.[5] It is indicated that the intended of this sentence is not the same as the reward for their action or the warning from it, but rather the intention of the extent of the wondrous situation from the two of the people who are the same The wonders of the people of the book, then arrange the punishment for that until their grandmother knew about it, and the two of them were mentioned to them, Dunya, and it is the one who is the good Great.And the meaning of what they had to enter it, except for those who were disgraced, that they would not have after this act to enter those mosques that he prevented except when they were disgraced.And the horrors in its news indicate the negation of the future, even if it was noticeable.There is no notification for this sentence in the past.And what is in his saying to them to the desirability, that is, what was entitled to enter in a state except in the case They must raise their hands from the behavior in the mosque and the rituals of God there and make the Muslims to the Muslims, so they will be after that, then they will not enter Disintered, and a promise to the believers, and God has believed and promised, and they were the day of the Mecca of disagreement and the two of the people until the call of the prophet of the Prophet ﷺ The many of them entered it, so they were taken to take the sword before their entry.And on the interpretation of “the mosques of God” by the general, the saying of what they would have to enter it, that is, they prevented the mosques of God in the event that they would have forgotten it.Fear is interpreted with fear The subject of the subjugation, the blame for this is in his saying, “What they had to“ are the one who is the one who is the one, and this face, and if its imposition is many of those who are the beneficiaries, except that the place of the name is the name of the name He arranged for what before him contradicts that this abuse is determined and preceded by prevention and endeavor in the tree.(P-682) And his saying to them in the world is a second budget, and he did not compose what he accepted so that he could be intended to be desperate, and he will be fulfilled to him.A follower is not concerned with the Samaids like the blame of the blame, and because it runs from the nurse, which was before it, the Bayan al -Bayan from the clear, then the shame is the fear of the The two shareds of the two participants received a day of the heinous killing and the families, and the day they received, and it opens a maaka from the treachery of the law.And he said to him and for them in the hereafter a great torment that was sympathetic to what he accepted because it is permissible for it, as it is what is meant by their group, that they have the torment of the torment in the torment.And when we descend this verse is authorized to be involved in the entrepreneur from the forefathers of the Prophet about the righteousness of the kaaba, after the abandonment of it The forbidden mosque is more severe than the one who is not the same as the kaaba in the prayer at the end of his saying, the Almighty, who asks you about the month of the forbidden, in which there is a ritual, and the one who is in it is the one who is in it.With him, the mosque is the forbidden, and the exit of his family from him is greater than God [Al -Baqarah: 217]
