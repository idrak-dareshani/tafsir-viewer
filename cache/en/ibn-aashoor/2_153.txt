The Quranic researcher, O those who believe, seek patience and prayer, God is with the patient and do not say to those who kill in the path of God, but not beyond, but there is no life, but there is no life, but there is no life, but there is no life, but there is no life.It is an opposite between his saying, and wherever you were, and your faces are his wounds [Al -Baqarah: 150] and what he communicated with from his reasoning with his saying to him, for the sake of God, for the sake of God.150] And what was composed of him from his saying, and my blessings be upon you [Al -Baqarah: 150] to his saying and thank me and do not disbelieve [Al -Baqarah: 152] Your faces are before the deceased and the Moroccan [Al -Baqarah: 177] because that is a complement to the payment of the obedience in the matter For people to have an argument [Al -Baqarah: 150] who is connected to his saying, and wherever you were, they were your faces of his part [Al -Baqarah: 150].And it is a kind of synthesis in which the Muslims are prepared for the people of the religion of the religion A nation, a simplicity, and a magnitude of the people (P-52), and their preference for the journey to the righteousness With the oppressors, and not to fear them, and to guide them that I have been blessed with them and guided them, and he gave them to them that he sent them to them, and he sent them to them, and he sent them to them.The greatness is like thank you and the male, because thank you and the remembrance of them is the destruction of the souls to the great of the work For the soul on the great of the work, it is appropriate for it, and also, then what was mentioned by his saying, so that people will not be for you for Hajj [Al -Baqarah: 150] To eagerly and doubt them, and the good for them, so they were commanded to seek help from them with patience and prayer.All of them are a consequence of the propaganda of the transmission, except that it is the same as the description and the murmur of the rituals of God [Al -Baqarah: 158] to his saying, Shakir, knowing it [Al -Baqarah: 158], so we will come to us.The words are open to the call because it has a great and great news, because the great news of the news that the addressee is to be presented before To accept it to be forgotten before it is surprised.And in the opening of this speech by using patience, then it will be followed by the scarring to a great work and a severe bond, and that is the end of the To the invasion of Badr al -Kabiri, if the conversion of the gas was the kiss of the time of the kissing of the kiss, as the kiss was converted in a rival or the two peoples of the Sunnah of the Sunnah of the Sunnah The invasion of the signs of the first and the first in the first year of the second year, and it was not a fight, and it was the largest of the oldest in Ramadan of the Sunnah The second was after the kissing of two months.It was presented in the interpretation of his words, and what God would have lost your faith [Al -Baqarah: 143] that what was signed in the hadith of Al -Barai ibn Azib from the saying that the people of the people killed the people.The kiss, that it is an illusion of one of the narrators from the light, for the first killing in the path of God was signed in the invasion of Badr, and it is after the kissing of the kiss, and the one who is in the way The hadith of Al -Tarmahi on the authority of Ibn Abbas said, “When the Prophet was directed to the Kaaba, they said, O Messenger of God, how are our brothers who died while they prayed to the house of God.” Those who were killed.The face in the interpretation of this verse is that it is a matter of Muslims to patience with the sebanks of war, and love for the testimony to them.(P-53) This is the occurrence of the expression of the harms in his saying to those who are killed in the path of God who feels that he is an excluded matter and they are the ones who kill in This verse.The saying was presented in the counterpart of this verse when his words are upset and seek help from patience and prayer, and it is a greatness [Al -Baqarah: 45] Franks, and it is a great knowledge of it with the weakness of their condolences from the great bones, and he said: “You are only on the bereavens.” The Muslims may make them easy for them to make them difficult for them, and that they are the humbled who are the one who has been implemented by God Who is the one who is the same as this matter and is considered for that in the cruelty of the patient.And his saying is that God is with the Saberin, which is a sacrifice in the sense of illusion, that is, be patient, so that God will be with you because he is with the patient.And say it and do not say to those who kill in the path of God, there are noes, but the life of the end of the end before it before the occasion of the exposure to the invasion of what is killed by what is killed.The path of God, when they were commanded by patience, they know that the death in the path of God is the most powerful of what they patted from it, but he alerted with that of the patience of the righteousness His dignity after testimony, and when his distress is certain of his destiny from the eternal life, then he said it and do not say that it is forbidden for the saying of the one who does not say that He says only what is met in the meaning: and do not believe, and it is clear that this is an inclusion of his saying, and God was not to waste your faith [Al -Baqarah: 143] as you are from the Hadith: People were killed before the kissing of the kiss.And the deaths of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning; That is, do not say they are the ones.And instead of the heroic scrubs, the heroes are for the sacrifice of the one who said it, And appreciation: but they are life, and the meaning is not, but they say they are life because what is meant is the news of the addressees.It is taught after the "" Al -Darabi ".Rather, he said, but you do not feel the sign that it is a life that is not bound or material (P-54), but rather a spiritual life, but it is an increase in the life of the life All of them are all life, and it is the numbers of humor and the acceptance of the embodiment in the thorns with a sense of what it is in a hill to a nickname or a hell, and the life of those who have been killed in the life of those who have been killed A life that is included in the enforcement of the pleasure of paradise, high -level and full discoveries, and this is a response in the hadith, “The souls of the righteousness are made in Sprinkle from the fruit of paradise and drink from its hundred." And the judgment in that is that the connection of the pleasures with the souls is standing on the middle of the body of the body, so when the spirit separated from the body, it is a dedication to the body To be a way to fill it.
