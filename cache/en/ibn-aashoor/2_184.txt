The Quranic researcher, who was sick or on a traveler, is a few days from the last days of the punishment of the ruling of the determination of the ruling of the ritual Before the remembrance of the rest of the fast, the fasting of the fasting is the slave of the whispers, so that they do not think that the fast is in every case.And the satisfaction of the one who has the disease, and the mood of the mood is from the limit of the medical domestication, where it is evolved in the body, a mother, a pain, or a failure.The jurisprudence has been destroyed in the definition of the disease required for breakfast, but the dominant satisfaction that does not stand up The difference between them is that it is permissible for breakfast, but it is obligatory, and the disease that has been written down, so they disagreed with his inception, so he went to the sake of the sake You will get with it with fasting, angry, with the hardships of the fast for the correct one of the hunger and the used thirst, in which it is caused by it, or it is a weak or a weak He takes him in it, or increases his warning to the disease, or he is afraid of the disease's continuing with his reason.This is the saying of Malik, Abu Hanifa and Al -Shafi’i on a recession between them in the transit, and the amendment of the terms is what we have been transferred from your money, because God has given the path of the path It is not permitted the fungus except because that disease has an effect in the fasting person, and the disclosure of that is the saying of Al -Qarfi in the twenty -first difference, when he said: He said: He said: He said: He said: A weakness that does not relinquish that worship, such as ablution and washing in the time of the cold and as fasting, and like the risk of the soul in jihad, and the division is what is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is disturbed by it.The effect of it in worship (P-163) is a painful, for the fast is not increasing the pain of the saturation, and this is not the tattooing of it, and the domesticity of it is the most effective The soul, the members and the benefits, and this requires that of that worship, and a type that is closer to this, and what is required of it is required.Ibn Sirin and Ata went: Al -Bukhari until the disease, which is the pain and the attribute, justifies the innocence, even if the fast was not influenced by a severity or an increase.Because God Almighty made the disease because of the innocence, as he made the travel because of the innocence, without calling for a warning, as in the travel, they want that they want to be Al -Zaidah is mostly, it was said: Bennabur took a light cause in Ramadan, so I was rejected by the son of his Rahayi, in a blow from his companions, so he said to me: You break my fast, O Abu Abdullah, say: The blessed, on the authority of Ibn Jarraj, said: I said to a giving: from what is the disease I break?He said: From any A disease that was, as God Almighty said: Whoever is from you is sick and said: If the sick person does not appreciate the prayer, he does not break the fast, but this is a special condition that is more likely Goodness and Al -Nakhdi, and his weakness is not hidden; Where is the prayer in the prayer of breakfast in fasting, and in this dispute is a field to look at the definition of the extent of the warning and the illuminated ill And we decide on it from the hardships that have the migrant and for the timed woman.And his saying: Or on a travel, that is, if it was in the case of travel and the origin of (on) the significance on the use of the sales, then it was used as a metaphor in the possibility as it is in the place of the one who said: He was guided by their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 5] Then it was popular in the words of the Arabs to say: So -and -so on a travel; That is, a traveling person to be a text in the dressing, because the name of the actor undertakes the future, so they do not say on a travel to the devotion to him and the saying.....What is on the veil, if he travels, that the tormented in his passion is on a travel that he wanted to be on the authority of the deadly, so he made a mistake from the mistakes of those who are born in the Arab The recession is the same as the verb, that the traveler does not break the fast until it is taken in the walk in the travel without the inbully of the intention, and the question is in it.Bin Malik that he wanted to travel in Ramadan, and his dirt was traveling, wearing the clothes of the travel, and the sunsets were approached, so he was fed, so he was eaten, and he was eaten, then he was eaten.The Sunnah, narrated by Darqatni, which is the saying of the Basr Al-Basri, and a group said: If he becomes a resident, then he traveled (P-164) after that, then he does not break the fast, and he is the one who breaks it.Malik, Al -Shafi’i, Al -Awazi, Abu Hanifa, and Abi Thawar, for if he breaks the judiciary without the disbelievers, and some money, then he said: The wardrobe, and from the wonder the choice of Ibn Al -Arabi, said to him, and Abu Umar ibn Abd al -Barr said: This is not something because God has permitted him to the pharaoh, and he said: Ahmad, Isaac, and Al -Shaabi: He breaks out if he travels after the morning and narrated it from Ibn Omar, which is the correct one who is witnessing the hadith of Ibn Abbas in Sahri “The Messenger of God ﷺ came out from the city to Mecca, so he was fasting until he reached the sake of the sons, then he called with a water, so he raised it to his hand to see him, so he said: Al -Qatibi: This is a text in the door, so what he violates is fell.Rather, he said: A number of other days [Al -Baqarah: 185] and he did not say: Fasting days of other days, ahead of the days of the days of days in the number of days of the fast in the past in As the number is only on a similar estimation.So; To be overflowing if it is considered “days” of the days of the numbers; That is, from the days of eternity or the Sunnah, or be “From“ Timiz ”is a number, meaning: a number of days, like his saying: five thousand of the angels [Al -Imran: 125], and described the days of the last, and it is the one who is a group of people Group; As every gathering is feminine, and this is presented in the words of the exaggeration: days of numbers.It is a description of a number, and it has a look; Because this suspicion does not fall into confusion; Because the number of days are days, then it is not considered to pay for this suspicion, so it is clear that the enemy is for the other to take into account the form of the collection in the descriptions with the sake of the light.And he said (the last) of a variety of flashes in the words of the Arabs.The grace of the grammarians is to prevent it from knowing their origins by the fact that the description and justice are in it.And his individual with the form of the name of the preference, and it was not known to the imam, which was his right to be obligated to the righteousness and remembrance of the Sunnah Calculation of the blame and from the addition to the knowledge - that it is necessary for individuals and remembrance, so when the Arabs have given him a custody of his descriptions in the time of the time, we know that they are in the time Its origin, and the enemy from the original requires the weight of the tongue; Because it is not the accustomed of the recovery, so they reduced it to prevent it from the shower, and as if they did not do that in its indignation and gather it, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, And in it is what is in it.(P-165) And the verse did not show the description of the fast of Ramadan, so it was released, “several days from the last days [Al-Baqarah: 185]”, and you did not show that it would be a follower, Neither the initiative is notified or the last of its delay, nor is the disbelief on the fungus deliberate By launching the existence of what he restricts, as he holds it in general if the specialist does not appear, and it is evidenced that the origin is in the worship of worship that it is on the authority of the servant.As for the ruling of the days of the judiciary, the Darqatni narrated with a correct bond, Aisha said: “A number of last days” said, ” You want: it was copied, and it is the saying of the four imams, and it said of the companions, Abu Hurairah, Abu Ubaidah, Mu’az bin Jabal, and Ibn Abbas, and that is from the And for the sake of the alert to it, he released his saying: From the last days, he was not restricted to follow -up as he said in the disbelief of Al -Zahhar, and in the disbelief of killing the mistake.This is the absence of the rituals of the righteousness of the servants of the servants on the row of the judge, and they did not restrict the divorce of the ritual of the fast with what is the same And the disbelief to kill the mistake.And in the authority of Ibn Omar, he says: He fasts the spent of Ramadan, followed by He breaks it from the disease or travel, Al -Baji said in the seller: It is enticed to want the garment and to want the starman.As for the initiative with the judiciary, it is not in the book nor in the Sunnah what is required, and its saying here: a number of last days [Al -Baqarah: 185] is intended by the matter, and the matter is not, and the matter is not.The Sunnah went on that the speeches of Ramadan are not obligatory in it, but it is expanded to the months of two peoples from the Sunnah of the year for the month of the one who breaks in it, and in the one who has been in it, and in the one who has been in it, and in it, and in it, and in it, and in it, and in it, and in the one who has been in it, The fast will be from Ramadan, so what I can spend is only in two peoples.This is the explanation of the significance of the soul of the Fire, and that the scholars ’gambling and the duplicate of the Zahri said: As for whoever breaks the baptized day from the days of Ramadan, then the public is that there is no disbelief on it; Because the infidels were made a memorizer for the prohibition of the month of Ramadan, and for the days of the judiciary a prohibition, and Qutdah said: It is obligatory for the disbelievers that the disbelief is based on it I originally.* * * (P-166) and on those who can be restricted by the food of the food of the poor of the food, the saying of it is fasting.Some; That is, it was written on those who are restricted by a ransom; For those who are tolerated by some who address it by saying: Fasting has been written on you [Al -Baqarah: 183].And the exemption is the one who made the verb;
