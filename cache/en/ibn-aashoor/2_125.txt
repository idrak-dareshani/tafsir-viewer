The researcher, when we made the house a reward for people and a security, and took from the shrine of Abraham, a prayer, and our covenant to Abraham and his listening to purify my house for the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people and the people of the people It is perpetuated in the memory of the vengeance of Abraham, when God made his house with this guidance, and when he added it to his majesty, he said my house, and it is a gossip for the one On the one who was bound and repeated, as it is to be an alarm on (P-708), the exclusion of the story, and that it is a grandfather that it is considered another structure, nor the fools to the arrival of the guarantee of this The last or before it, as it is not imposed in that in the place of the remembrance of the virtue, and because the waw does not benefit a parameter.The house is the name of a sitting for the place that is taken as a residence or a number of people in the supply of purposes.It is a place in which the earth is surrounded by what he distinguishes from the rest of his seat from the ground so that the silence is in the past to be taken into account for himself and whoever follows him, so he will follow him We were from the cold and the free and a veil in which it is seen from the people and is surrounded by its furniture and affairs, and it may be special and it is the majority and it may be for a group like a group like a group like a group like a group The Arabs and the client of the lunch are in the children of Israel, and it may be the surrounding of the house from the stone and mud like the kaaba and the house Poetry said: He said, and he made you from the Galaoud of Anthum, which you will be hidden.And the sofa of the blood and the tents.And the house is aware of the dominance of the kaaba, as the stars are overwhelmed by the richness.The origin of the flags in the flags of the prevailing is the covenant, and that if the covenant of an individual is a single person between a sect between a sect or a people who became the name They may pledged with that original meaning as in the stars of the pharaoh and the book for the Qur’an and the house for the kaaba, and the original meaning is forgotten as a matter Khawilal ibn Nafil, or by the confinement of the sex in it like sun.And the kaaba is a house that is forbidden by the wickedness of peace be upon him, and he is the one who will be harbored to the worship Therefore, he added it to God, with the transgression of this meaning, as he said that a purification of my house for the sects, and in his saying when your forbidden house is our Lord, and the Lord of the Lord: Al -Kaaba is in the name of the house from the era of the ignorance, Zuhair said: ؎ I divided the house, which was around him, the men of his children from the Quraysh, and the righteousness of the He returned and said a reward and a garment such as a place and a place, and what is meant by the reward is that the people intend it with greatness and beyond it.What is meant by people The inhabitants of Mecca from the offspring of Asmail and all those who visit them and enter their sweets, so that people will be disappeared for the thief, and the knowledge of the people, People visit him, and they are gone, and people will succeed them.“ Others, so those who left the visitors were based on their position in the lineage for the house and its inhabitants, and it is permissible to hold the people of the people to the one Those who wrapped themselves as they are the fullness of the visitors, so they returned to him with justice, and so was the affair with the Arabs.Security is a source that has been told about the house by adopting that it caused a security, so it was made as if the soul of security is exaggerated.Security is the preservation of people from the harm, so the preacher and the guardianship of the country and the guidance of the paths and the illumination of the methods are safe, and the equivalent of the perpetrators and the harm to the darkness of the injustice Rights to their people are a security, for security is in every case with what causes it, and when the predominance of the ignorance of the ignorance took the power of the weak, and it was not between them, and it was not between them, nor was it a matter.The mother is a day that is the life between the strong and the weak, so God made the house a security for people on the day, that is, the strong will be repelled We made a safe sanctuary and the people are kidnapped from their around, so this is from the people of the ignorance, and in Islam, the richest of God has the richest of what he has offended, and what is the richest That is sufficient security.Al -Sahili said, and the exalted of the shrine of Abraham and whoever entered it was safe, but it is a news about the greatest of his sanctity in the ignorance of the rum A reconciliation of the offspring of peace be upon him.The jurisprudence in the use of this verse and its harm to the judgment of the residence of the limits and the punishment in the forbidden will come, and the detail of it will come to them, and it will be separated by it.The mosque is the forbidden [Al -Baqarah: 191] The verse is not from the abuse of this verse.What is meant is from making the verse is either the formation of the formation, because that God has destroyed it and found its reasons, so it is decided that between the people of the ignorance, and it is easy for them to be.God, His Excellency with that, and his son, his son, Asmail, and his transmission in his offspring, and their heels are given to him.Ibrahim, peace be upon him, covenant that God is richer from him with the rulings of security in Islam in every place and God Almighty has been intended, so he does not give you what happened in the mosque in the mosque Al -Hajjaj in the temptation of Ibn Al -Zubayr, nor what happened in it from nomadic, killing, and rust in time Al-Qarqiyah, when the goodness of Al-Hosan Bin Baram Al-Junaabi is a relative to a country that is said to be a hookah (P-710), the noun is the great of the Qarmah, when it was killed.And he used to say to them, O dogs, who did not he said to you Muhammad al -Makki.!It is ignorant of the stupid because God wanted the matter to make the mosque a safe one in the period of the ignorance, as it was not for people to be removed from the dark And the divorced woman, they are three readers of themselves [Al -Baqarah: 228] and his saying and took from the shrine of his revelation, the prayer of his readers, a sophisticated and a son of the same So this is taking from the effects of that eclipse, as the meaning is our people to take from the shrine of Abraham, or we will command them to do so on the tongue The significance of the incidence of the path of the connotation of the conjunction is that it was said: We made that, so they took it, and read it to the remainder of the tenth by breaking the matter of the matter Say: Take the category of speech, so the factor is deleted, deleted with the villages, and the rest of its work is as a saying of a good: ؎ In two, it is its oppression and its age, and it wanted and its aged, for it is not said to the chicks of the good, the fillings of the two readings, to one benefit.And the shrine of Abraham is called the Kaaba because Abraham used to stand up to her, and God is exalted and called for his altercation.In his extent ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ The shrine of Ibrahim on the stone, which was standing on him, peace be upon him, when he was built by the kaaba, so that he would benefit from the place of the carpentry at the top of the ritual, as well The effects of his feet were established in the stone.Anas ibn Malik said that I saw in the denomination the effect of his tranquility and the fifth of his feet, so that he gave it to the people of their hands.ﷺ In his position, two rak'ahs after the tawaf of the elderly, so the kneeling had a year of emptiness.And the prayer is the place of prayer and their prayers on the day of supplication and submission to God Almighty, and Abraham (P-711) was put in place He has for the children around it, so the prayer was on the stone called the place, so this is the worshiper, taking from the shrine of Abraham on both of the two.And the two readings require that taking the place of Ibrahim was a prayer that was the covenant He has it, but it is an inclusive of the prayer in the mosque, and when Islam came, the matter remained on that until it was the year of the pilgrimage or the year And Omar ibn al -Khattab, then the prayer was given at the place in the circumambulation of the elderly.Al -Bukhari narrated on the authority of Umar ibn Al -Khattab that he said: I agreed to my Lord in three: I said, O Messenger of God, if we took from the shrine of Abraham.A prayer, and this narration enriches another means for the verse, which is that the speech is a direction of Muslims, so they will be a sentence and take from the place Between the sentence of the house, the house is a reward for people, a sentence, and our covenant to Abraham So she descended that he came down to the prophet ﷺ the prayer of the prayer at the stone of the shrine after that it was not hungry for them to straighten the gathering between me With the form of the past and with the form of the matter, the last formula does not undertake that it is not the story of what was in the time of Ibrahim For Muslim people, a tank for the Qur’an with everything that its provinces bear, according to what we have in the nine.And his saying and our covenant to Abraham and the hearing of the covenant is the origin of the certainty, and his fell and the fool of the ritual of his saying: If he is prepared to the meaning of the commandment affirmed on the recommended one, he will be pledged here in the sense of sending a covenant to him, that is, send to him, and I will give him a custody of them.Abraham and his hearing, and his saying “that purification” is that the interpretation is that the commandment is in the sense of saying without its forefathers, so the interpretation of the one who says the one who is the one who says: If you do not fate in the words, if not for the story of the saying, he would not have come after the matter, and he said to purify my house, etc.(P-712) It is intended from the purification of the house, which indicates that the purification is noticed from a sense that it is preserved from the dirt and the dirt to be the worshiper in it.Federation, and from the purification of my mean, which is to distance it from what is not met with intention of its construction from the idols and the contradictory acts of the truth, such as the aggression, the one, the one, the one, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not have the right to the right, and the truth For the mud, like the taid, without the clothes of men and women.In this, this is an illness that the participants are not a family of the mosque in the forbidden, because they did not purify him from what he must be cleared of from him, and they said: The righteous [Al -Anfal: 34] and he said: O you who believe, but the partners are unclean [Repentance: 28] and those who are familiar, the people, the people, and those who are glorified, are the types of worshipers Female, And prayer and they are the varieties of those who are afflicted with those characteristics, whether they are separated by some of the nose with some of these attributes or the adjectives in a sect or a lord, and the rituals of the roll, Before the place of the mosque, the forbidden, and these are the hearing and its sons and its nights from their germs, and everyone who believes in the two sons of the Hanafi from their neighbors.The group and the coffee were collected, gathered in peace, and gathered the knee and the prostration gathered a broken group, artistic in the words and after the kindness of the formula is more than the same The saying of the Muslims of the believers of the compassionate, the prohibition: 5] the verse, and its saying that the Muslims, the Muslims, the believers, and the believers [the parties: 35] The lifesters and the people are a group of peace, because it is close to the verb of the verb with a house that circumambulates, that is, they renew the tawaaf to do the urbanization of the goodness The house is with the disagreement of the kneeling and prostration, for it is not necessary to be in the house, nor with it, so this is not unanimous in peace, and this words are not gathered by the gathering of peace Business from the notice of edge and renewal, and testify to him the words of my father Al -Fateh ibn Jinni in the explanation of the Hammasah when the saying of Al -Ansi al -Ansar: Displaced ∗∗∗ He fears his bids on the two peers, Abu Al -Fateh.The verb, and if the verb is attached to the source, it is broken by the dates of his brother, his brother, the ritual of his brother was attached to it.The meaning of the verb is excluded from the likeness of the verb.If we settle for them to be contrary to their formulas, he said a thick: If they hear, as I heard its words ∗∗∗, they were removed to the pride of a rak'ah and a prostration, and they did not know.It is an actor on hearing actions, so there are witnesses, bosses, prostitutes, and prostration.They are a separate grade.
