The researcher of the Qur’an, we copy from a verse or forget it, we come to the goodness of this verse for the verses before it that the Jews apologized for their symptoms from the faith of the faith.We believe in what was revealed to us [Al -Baqarah: 91] and they wanted it that they disbelieve in others while they are in their virginity, so they claim that their project does not get tired of it.Al -Tawarah is a right and that it came as a believer for it, so how is its law to be invalid for the supply and they will not protect the people with what he called the gossip, and it is the best of God What is good for its legitimacy and that it appears to him, then he is exposed to it and replaces a project with a project.We have provided that God Almighty responded to them and exposed them that they are not holding on their parts until they prayed in it and they said: God's wiper before [Al-Baqarah: 91] “and his saying (P-655)” Say: If you have the last house for you [Al-Baqarah: 94] “Etc.And that they have no reason for them other than the good They disbelieved from the people of the book [Al -Baqarah: 105] to his saying “The great preference” is the one that the cause is the envy.When the response was shown to them in all of that, he wanted to break that embarrassment or suspicion that they intended to be tired of people by preventing the copy.The original intention of this is the knowledge of the Muslims originally from the origins of the bodies, and it is the origin of the copy that is dared to a project with a project after it, and it is a valid after it.A project with judgments that it invalidates from that project.And for the fact that this is the original intention, it is amended by the address of Jews by responding to them and directed the speech to the Muslims, as he said: “He said to him” By saying it, or do you want to ask your Messenger [Al -Baqarah: 108] and say what we are copying from a verse and did not say from a project.In these symptoms of addressing the Jews, because the Muslims know the most important, and that is followed by the response to Jews with the way of equality, because if it appears, it appears.For a reconciliation, the ruling appears to change some of the bouquets.Some of the interpreters have mentioned the verse of the verse, because of the descent.About him, and in the interpretation of the murder, that the Jews stabbed in the abomination of the kiss and said that Muhammad commands his companions with something and forbids them from it, so what is the Qur’an Some of it violate each other.And the jams (copying) read the opening of the first noun and the conquest of the Sunnah, which is the origin of the horrors (copying), and Ibn Amir read it to the first of the noun and the brokenness of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who broke the one who is the sake With the prodigy of the transcendence, that is, we command the transcription of a verse.The condition of the connection is the meaning of the condition, so it was a name For the condition, it deserves to express the rituals and shows what is explained by its thumb, and it is also obligatory in the pods of the bond, because the bond, which is the relationship, is what is not.It indicates a certain time from the most prominent of the answer to the condition and attached it to it.And “from a verse” is a bayan.And the verse in the evidence is indicative and witnessed.Al-Harith ibn Halaza said: “Who have it for him for good, for all three in all of them.A thousand to move it and open what it accepted and the relative to it, or Awi.Then the verse was released on the miracle because it is the evidence of the Messenger’s sincerity.The Qur’an that is divorced by a legal ruling, a preacher, or the like, which is the divorce of Quran You are different, but rather do not know [the bees: 101] and support this that one of the suffering of the verse in the words of the Arabs that the messengers give to the messengers to the messenger to believe him They sent a ware or a news with a messenger, whipped him with a practice that they call a verse, especially the prisoner, if he is sent to his people with a sacrifice, as he did the evil of the one who was in Bin Malik and sent to his people with a missionary and wanted to warn them of what their enemies show them to them Holding.Sahim al -Abd said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗

meant by the verse here is the ruling of the verse, whether it is removed from it, or it remains for its memorial because the intended is the rule of the rulings of the rulings, the rulings are not removed.The copy is the removal of the thing with something else that the rich said, it is a reflection of the removal of a picture or the same and the tricks other than it, and it says: And its successor in its position, and the shaved shadow, so that the imagination of the body that was between the entertainment and the grace of the sun in the body of the sun is the one who is the sun of the sun.Its position, and it is said: I copied what is in the cell of the bees and honey to another cell, and it may be called the removal of the east and only without a murder as the one who said: The impact, and on the essence, but it is a special proof, which is the proof of the remote, and as for the repetition of the tricks, I do not calculate it as correct in the language, even if it is an illusion, and it is the most important From it, their saying is the book of the book if you plan the likes of its forefathers in your newspaper, as they found it as well Launching Ajaz with the images or representatives in the case of those who remove the letters from the original book to the copying book and then came from that copy, he said: You work [Al-Jathiya: 29] and he said, and in its copy, it is a gift and a mercy [Al-A'raf: 154].The copy is not called the removal of an isolation, so do not say: The day is copying the night, because the night is not a matter of goodness, but it is the darkness The fierce crime.What is meant by copying is the removal of the disadvantage and the rituals of his saying that he came with good or like it, and he is known to the origins of the people of the people.So the legislator came out as it is not a lift, and it came out with our saying, the law of the law.As the authenticity is not a legal rule, but it is the survival of the numbers that the people were before it before the coming of the legitimacy, where the urbanization is not.To save the permissibility of permissibility except in the suspicion of the perception of its prohibition or in the position of the prohibitions of the prohibitions or the obligations, then the first is the one who says it is not for you You seek a grace from your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 198] in the merchants, in Hajj, where the Muslims thought that the merchants are forbidden in the ten days of the pilgrimage, as if it was on the authority of the ignorance of the ignorance The metaphor is as it comes, and the second proverb is the saying of the Almighty, and it is permissible for you behind that [Women: 24] after the remembrance of the forbidden women and his saying, I will be permissible for you to do so [Al -Baqarah: 187] To be confined to the hearts of the consequences of the time of the day.And it was understood from their saying in the definition.The raising of the lawful judgment, which is known for its time with a discourse that he raised to come out of the transcription of the copy.The judgment raised the rule that is not indicated in it.And where the rule of the verses is known to know the ruling on the copying of the parties, some of which are some of it, which is the one who denied it and denied the place The inhabitants of the period are forbidden from faith in Islam, as they said: We believe in what was revealed to us while it is the conditions: the first: the coming of a project for a resurrection of the one who is a long time The messengers of it (P-658), if it is died, the project will benefit as the project of Noah, Abraham, and the project of Joseph, and the project of Sha’ab said: “And you have come to you.” [34] His saying, if he was perished, you will not be sent by a messenger after him.That project or some of it, as they followed the project of Ibrahim People in its follow -up, which was for them in the time of the veal, as it was a man, for example, for which it is permissible to follow the project of Abraham.Follow it.The second: that a project comes to the people who are commanded to be a mosquitoes, and then it will come after a project that is not brought to the part of it.Some of its rulings and prove some of the project of Jesus.What is stipulated in its copy, and otherwise, it remains on the rulings of the delegation, so it is in its greatness, shown, remembrance, and interpreted as those who preceded it from the Prophet of the sons The first Zakariya, Daniel and their Arabism, and this type is not violated by copying one project of one project, except by its formation by a second messenger.The third: The coming of a project after another, where the second second is invalidated by general heroes, where that project is considered void, whether the rulings that are the rulings that are the rulings that are In it with something that contradicts what is in the first, or when the second project is silent about it, and this is the Islam with the lineage because of what it provides from the partner, for it is the lifting of the part of it.No one of the Muslims is to receive anything from the wasting bodies, while Islam did not speak to him with anything, but take the rulings of that and that is the rulings of that The origins of Islam were made, and it was disagreed that the one before us is a law for us that we did not want to reputation, but that disagreement is looking for another indication, and it is the saying of it.[Al -Anam: 90] And his saying, “Or we forget it”.And in a fracture, then.And Ibn Katheer and Abu Amr (we forget it) read it with a fatal bean in his first and with a foolish dress, and after it is a hasty thym The forgetfulness and the prodigy of the enemy, and its effective, is deleted for the public, that is, we forget the people, and that is in the matter of the prophet ﷺ by leaving its readers, and it is the right of it.The readings of the prodigy, the meaning or its delay, that is, we delay its recitation or the delay of the work with it, and what is meant by the heroes of the work with its readers or its rule (p-659) (p-659) Another section is an interview for copying, which is that the Messenger does not remember the people by doing a holy ruling and does not command someone who leaves him with the judgment of the people, so that he will be the same Battle for the rule because it was if the Messenger would not be silent about Returning the matter with him, and when his skepticism is approved at the obligatory work of it, and I did not find this example in the Qur’an, and his counterpart in the Sunnah is the saying of the Messenger of God.Wood in his grandfather, "when someone says that the forbidden is in it for the prohibition, and it is the saying of my father Hurairah, and for that he was remembered by this hadith, and he said to you, and he said to you.I will be thrown with it between your appearance.The meaning of the abuse is poetic, with the last one, which is followed by Abraham and then.Or is the person who is intended to be the same in the sense of the delay in its coming with the will of God, the exalted, and that after that, after the time, and the arrival of the rituals of the ritual of the ritual Copy a project with project or its wipers or its wretches.And his saying came with goodness or like it, the condition of the condition, and made it a poetic answer that these two cases are the copies, the women, or the waters, and the waters are not in the case.The copy and the time of the women with something is better than the human being, or the like, or the best of the forgotten or the wiping, or the like, so the one who comes with it is from the copy The one who comes with it with the women of the forgetfulness is the transcriber is also from a project or a judgment or is what comes from the rulings other than those who are transcribers, but there is a disbeliever, and the one who is a disbeliever is the one who comes to the one Winter, that is, delay is what compares the rest of the rulings that are descending in the period of the numbers.I have completed the other side and the ideal, so that the soul of the Sama is gone, every time that is possible, and you find it intended, because the good is from the one who is the one who will be from the one who will be The reconciliation of the people, or what is driven by them, or what is in it is the heart of Hamidah, or what is in it is rewarded reward, or what is in it is a companion in the way The positions of the intensity, even if they hold them on the severity, may be more reconciliation.It is not intended that every image of the volatile images in cases of copying and women or the women is a disgraceful and the same, but what is meant is that every one of them is not from them The insults are better than it or the example of it, so this is a good thing or in its saying, more than it, or the same as it is useful for one of the two things with the gathering.(P-660) And the sacrifice of the images is achieved with your hands, and we will be struck by this as a guidance that is guided to the intended and eliminates the rest with the rest of the commitment So we say: (1) Copy a project with the two things, such as the copying of the teeth and the Gospel in Islam.(2) A copy of a project with the two, with the same as a project of project, is a good project, for each of the most likely is a similar to the last in the end of the last The two approaches of the people and the ethics, as they are the best of them to build with all the rent They are in favor of it, and it is not forbidden for that and forbade exposure to the elegance of the face.(3) A copy of a ruling in a project with a good project of it, such as the copying of the steadfast wine, by saying it, say that there is a great sin and the benefits of it [219]: The copy is better than the reconciliation side without the companion, and the transcription may be better in the companion, as the copying of the prohibition of the greatest and the drink and the proximity Breakfast at the stranger, if the fasting sleeps before he lives with his saying, the highest is permissible for you, the night of fasting, the ritual fasting to your women [Al -Baqarah: 187] to the saying Saheeh Al -Bukhari, and the Muslims were happy with its descent.(4) The copying of a ruling in the project with a judgment like it is the copying of the commandment for the debts and the closest to the awareness of the exhibitors, and everyone is a fool for all of it.Fifty prayers with five prayers with the reward of the fifth of the fifth, so they are similar on the side [Al -Baqarah: 184] With his saying, “He who has witnessed from you the month, let him fast it [Al -Baqarah: 185] to his saying, and that you fast for you.” (5) A few in the sense of delay in the project with a good coming from it, the delay of the appearance of the religion of Islam in the time of the two parts of the precedent of each of it, it is one of it.For the nation that was made for it and the era in which it was made, then the partners come to people with what is appropriate for their conditions until the good is to the good.The conclusion that is the religion with God, for goodness is here with some of its suffering and it is a lineage.(6) A project in the sense of the delay of its coming with the will of God, the Exalted, and its fall after time and with the two things like it, as well It is better than that of the disgrace on the greatest interest and what the nation needs.(7) The sense of the delays of the judgment is intended with the two things, as well as the last of the prohibition of wine, and it is intended with the two years of his hatred, or the rituals For those who come to him are better than the prohibition from the way of people in their holders on the separation of something that they fell asleep with his love.(8) A project in the sense of its surgery is not a textured for a known term with the two things, otherwise, that is, the ninth and the best of the arrival and the most valuable (p-661) Likewise.(9) A verse of the Qur’an, in the sense of the survival, is not forgotten to a known term with the two things, good than it in another chapter, that is, the best of the chapter, or in the same chapter in a chapter in a chapter in the same section Reconciliation or reward, such as the prohibition of wine in the time of the prayers and the descent in that period, prohibiting the sale at the time of the Friday prayer.(10) A legitimate forgetfulness in the sense Its impersonation as the project of Adam and Noah with the coming of the project of Moses, which is better, widow, and the project of Idris, for example, and it is like a project of Noah.(11) The forgetfulness of a valid judgment with the coming of it is better than it, or the same, as it was the same ten days of information that was forbidden, so we will be forbidden, so we will be forbidden.The verse and your sisters came from breastfeeding [Women: 23] on divorce and all is similar in the proof of breastfeeding and no shadow over the costs in the breastfeeding or ten days of the one.It is said that the forgotten of the forgetfulness is that it is reversed by its meaning and its images to the meaning and the images of the women in the sense of delay.And the intention is from his saying, "It is good for it, or the same as it is the verge of the ruling and the response to them that they do not care about the custodian of the law With another judgment, and does not praise that in the knowledge of God, nor in his ruling, or his grapes, because he did not copy a law or a judgment, and he has not left it, and he has left it Then, or what is the same from the time and the situation, and what was delayed judgment in a time and then he appeared after that, except that the people were replaced in the time They are the same, and that is the appearance of the rabbit One is the memorization of the system of the world and the disconnection of the people in which it is in it on the face of the face of their conditions from the selection on the basis of the aspirations, the nations and the diligence until it came to the time Hope for people, and for that he said that the religion of God is Islam [Al -Imran: 19] and he also said to you from the religion of what Noah said [Al -Shura: 13] the verse.It is clear that the two are good or more likely to be copied and given to all of the copies and women, so the two of the two are good than the woven or the forgetfulness, or in the same way.So the Almighty said (He came with good or like it) is either a murmur or a reinforcement.This (P-662) is bound by the imperfection, which is not dear.The meaning is that we did not leave the creation at a time.And that the copy is not in the copying.In the verse, a brief summary in the division, the collection of the pictures that you heard and images inhale from them, I do not ask you because it was not imposed from it.And what poetry stands from him and does not want to look at him, some of those who are interpreted in his saying, “We forget it” that the God of God Almighty is the Almighty For the wall, that is, it is from its hearts or its prophets ﷺ ﷺ, so it is the forgetfulness of all people, all of which are at one time, indicating the copy Al -Tabrani brought it up with his bond to Ibn Omar: The fence of Surah, I read them, the Messenger of God ﷺ, and a person with a night pray We are copied and forgotten, so they are from it.The likeness of the hadiths.It is a pest in the human being, as the prophet is infallible before the tuber When he emptied, he said to my father, why did you not remember me?After it is permissible and does not carry the verse for his contradictions to the appearance of his saying: (We came with goodness or similar ones) and the forgotten person who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one It is permissible.It is permissible.As for what was mentioned in the authenticity of a Muslim on the authority of Anas, he said: We were reading a surah that we liked in length with a luster.لابْتَغى لَهُما ثالِثًا وما يَمْلَأُ جَوْفَ ابْنِ آدَمَ إلّا التُّرابُ, ويَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلى مَن تابَ اهـ.فَهو غَرِيبٌ وتَأْوِيلُهُ أنْ هُنالِكَ سُورَةً نُسِخَتْ قِراءَتُها وأحْكامُها, And the Muslims of the Muslims, as it was copied with the Qur’an, is not surprising that it is a strange hadith.Islam on the permissibility of copying and its fall, and it is not contrary to that except the father of the Muslim Al-Asfahi Muhammad bin Bin Bahar, so it was said that his disagreement is for my righteousness and the righteous (P-66) The origins of jurisprudence were written.Remove [do not want your fathers, for you are disbelieved in you to want your fathers].By rhetoric of the verse, and its example is a verse if you are twenty people who are patient [Al -Anfal: 65] to the last verses.The sheikh and the sheikh, if they adultery with them, and when it is not excessive in the copying of the recitation, and the survival of the judgment, and they have interpreted the saying of Omar, when it was followed by the one who was coming.His judgment.Her judgment does not remain in the Qur’an in the Bukhari in the interpretation.The last verse, so you did not write it, he said: O my nephew, I will not change anything from it from his place.* * * Did you not know that God is able to do everything.With good and likeness, there is no separate in the way of wise and wise, and that after he emptied the alerts that the copy is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was To deny the Messenger, it is not a difference in order to bridge the texts with goodness, like him, or to strengthen the rest of it, like him, I want to do so that he wants to do that It is suspicion that it says the denial and what is the one in the copying until it needs to be oppressed and it was necessary for the phenomenon to confront for the two sides of the disagreement of the prayer The hurricane and the sides of the trivial and the idealism in all people and the humanity, and when the confrontation was for that something that did not end the minds of the Samaids of the people Reconciliation and its recession, because that is what needs to be founded from the legitimate and political origins.The ability of God Almighty, which is not intended for it, is intended, and at the capacity of the Mashuar king of the greatness of his knowledge.And on the need of the creatures to him, as a Lord has no one who has no one without him without him, and he suffices with this evidence that he carries them (P-664) on their interests.It increases this preparation that you encourage that the confrontation with the patience opens the door of the newness in the proof of the reconciliation and the varying of that according to the disagreement of the readers and the one.Because the causes of legislation and copying are sections of it, what appeared in the text, so they can understand it, and it is the same as the saying of it, but the Satan wants to fall into the authority of the The wine and the facilitator [al -Ma’idah: 91] the verse after its saying, do not come close to the prayer, and you are my sins [Women: 43] the verse, and the like and know that you are weak [Al -Anfal: 66].And among them is what their understanding is difficult for it because it needs knowledge and separation from the law of the legislators and the scholars of origins, such as the things that are known for the measure and the privilege.And among it is not to be informed of his wisdom in that time, or when it follows it, and when the greatness of his consequences was difficult or the reassurance of their understanding.And for the form of this sentence, the house of the Bayan descends for the first, and it was separated from it.And the speech is in the “learning” that is not intended from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the prophet ﷺ, but it is either a discourse of others who are outside the way of the metaphor of the sake of the one who is not.The absent A house that addresses in his place in which he becomes a address to the month of this matter and the intention of that to work every addressee who is good for him, and he is everyone who thinks that he does not He knows that God over everything is fierce, even if he is running for his knowledge of his knowledge, and to this way, the money of the pole and the goodness of the evil of this is the shout of this.The Jews and the participants, and those who may be suspicious of the matter and the suspicion of the suspicion of it and the exemption of the Muslims, is promoted to him He entered it to hear otherwise.Either it is intended for it, and it is the one, so the addressee is the prophet ﷺ, but the intended from the Muslims, and he will be transferred from the discourse of the Prophet to the address Because the nation’s knowledge of the knowledge of the Messenger is from where it is a messenger who is a customary, so every judgment is related to it with the title of the mission, so what is the one who does not He has one of the information in the chapter on the chapters and the legislation, as it is a way that is intended from the discourse, the guarantee of the rhetoric to him and his nation and his mother who is intended to be intended For his nation, he only said to the book of writing in the will of the original meaning with the Kinary, and here it is not reconciled to the guidance of those who are the one who is the one who does not God is able to be fierce, as it is denying that it is denied by it, Rather, this method (P-665) was used without being brought in the guarantee of the group who addresses what is in the ways of the way of the rhetoric of rhetoric and void with the briefing in the word.And the understanding is a decision on the two guys, and it is the matter of the interrogation within the negation, as it is presented when it was said, I did not say that I am the best of the 33] That is, you know that God is destined and you know that he is the possession of the heavens and the earth with what is taking place in it from the circumstances, so it is his property as well, so it is the same.He indicated in the scouts that he was a junction and stated that the pole was in his explanation, and he was not heard in the words of the Arabs, who were in their words, but he was intended.And his saying did you not know that God has the king of the heavens and the earth.There is no crime to be capable of everything, so this sentence was separated from before.And when the chapter is obligatory, it is that the sentence is in the house Import the addressee.
