The Quranic researcher baffles those who are in the place of his forefathers, which are located in the first way of the light, and in the sacrifice of the other one, all of which are nine and ten years The angel, and some of them were in the second Surah, which came down while it was n.The spelling of the spelling is the first four of the fences, and it is the half of the spectacle and the most of the light in which these wars are located: Amr, and the forefathers located in the light are: In its interpretation.There is no disagreement that his philanthropist is when the reader is chosen by the names of the virginity that is evident in the words with its heavens, and that its names are in the place The exit of the forefathers, and that is, but the reader (a thousand Mim) is for example and does not say (mother), but they wrote it in the Qur’an with the images of the forefathers who are in the way that he is in the way The drawing of its form is the position of the one in it in the words, and they did not write it with the money of what they read about it in the Qur’an, because the intended is the argument of it and the ware of it.It was said that the drawing of the Muhsaf is an incomparable Sunnah for him, and this is the first that it is the most important of the dedicated sayings under it, and here is the one who is more likely to be the one who is the most likely - Those of the forefathers - to cry the two guards and record their miracles from the opposition, or their aspirations for the luminous, it is in it, or as it is in it.To explain the destiny of writing, and alert it to the Umayyad Arabs to (P-207), the benefits of writing to their exiles from the state of the illiterate, and the most correct of these sayings are the three sayings, the first sayings are the first.The second, the seven, the eighth, the second, the ten and the fifteenth, the sixth, the sixth, will be invalidated.With its heavens, not with its names; Because the drawing of the Muhsaf is an incomparable Sunnah, and this is the first because it is comprehensive of the words.Its name was known from two signs: one of them is the transcendence of the names of the names, such as the norm, when you say: the thousand, the Bly, and the same as the gathering: The description when you say: a thousand paid and the second what Sibuy said in his book: The Khalil said a day and he asked his companions how they were noticeable to you in the same way We said: Sufficient.B.He said: You came in the name and did not look at the letter and said I say it is, and with it he means a splendor and I fell in the last of the heat to do so, so that it is the same A single letter that does not appear in the region Unique.And who is used from the sayings of the scholars after he deleted his intervene and the neutrality of his problems is interpreted to one and twelve words and the severity I have never seen the exclusion of the sayings that we are to spread it with its diversion to three types: the first types are referring to the fact that it is a symbol that has been brought up.Secrets, the keys to the people of the knowledgeable, and the custody of the people of the known, and the way of this type are eighteenth.Weakened accounts, and perhaps they prove the knowledge of God on the intended one of them, His Messenger ﷺ said by the people and Safyan.The second is that it is a burning forever from the names and attributes of God, the exaggeration of the conquest with a similar prohibition for this void of the cut, narrated by Sa’id ibn Jabir, And Muhammad ibn al -Qarashi or al -Rabi` ibn Anas (the pain) is for example.The thousand is a sign of one, first or eternal, and the blame for kindness, and the meme to a king or a glorious, and the like, and on this, he needs in her two sides to a loyalty, and that he is a lord and that he has a licking A symbol of the name of God Almighty and the names of the Messenger, peace be upon him and the angels, for example, a thousand from God, and the imam is from Jabril and the Mim from Muhammad, and the laughter said, Fateh from it, and perhaps we will repent on that in its positions, the fourth is the reward of Sheikh Muhi al -Din in the eighth chapter and nine and the hundred in the chapter of 27 The prohibitions cut in the (P-208) prohibitions are the names of the angels, and that if it is followed, it was like a call to its angels, so the companions of these names are listened to what is the one who says that it is the same.With it, then they say that you are sincere if it is after it, and they say this is a believer in truly that he truly subjected and tested with a right, so they will be forgiven, and they will be forgiven, and they will be forgiven, Call.The fifth is that it is all symbols of the names of the Prophet ﷺ and his descriptions in particular said by Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih, who is known as the son of the one who is in the authority of the The virtue of the satire in the sacrifice of the light is able to do a group of its generous names and its own descriptions, so the thousands are able to do it for the sentence of the name The division, and the imam is placed in it for his attributes, such as the heart of existence, and the Mim is able to do it from Muhammad and his signs like a missionary and a sigh of it It is estimated by the appearance of that letters in Yass.This saying was not attributed to anyone, and he commented on this message, the sheikh of Islam, Muhammad, Mu’awad, the most important in which it is more than the number For the mourners of the heart, which is the origin of it, it is equipped with the storage of the gathering of Ziton, with a number of 514, and this saying is rejected The letter of the call and what he said from his appearance in Yassin is based on the saying of who said that Yassin in the sense, Master, is weak; Because the ya has a letter from the spelling of the spelling, and because the sheikh himself is after that after that from the forefathers indicating the names, as it is the same as the one who is the same A symbol of the period of this nation, by calculating the camel, said by Abu al -Ahali, taking a story narrated by Ibn Ishaq on the authority of Jabir ibn Abd al -Allah ibn He was written by the son of Akhtab and Kaab ibn Al -Asharf, so they asked the Messenger of God about the pain and said: This is the sake of this nation from the two years, and the seventy seventh of you said: “P.” and “Al -Murr”, so they said, the matter was walked to us, so we do not know the infection.We take a mother with a lot.And there is no other forefather from this, the one who is interrupted by the seized letters in the ills of the light, as it is a symptom of the number of this Rather, he wanted to invalidate what they understood by the heroes to be a beneficial to their grace on the one (P-209), the way that is called in the grave, and it is not possible.As for his sacrifice ﷺ, it is a fan of their ignorance.The following saying is that it is a symbol of every letter that was symbolized into a word, so we are the pain.It was narrated by Abu al -Duha from Ibn Abbas, and it is delusional that he has no connection to him because he took once with the metaphor of the letter with a letter of the first word, and a time The word or its last.And they saw it that the Arabs had spoken of the cut off, instead of words that are compatible with those letters, an organized and prose, from that of the saying The evil of F, and I do not want evil, unless he wanted, and if evil is evil, and he wanted only to shine, so he came with a letter from every sentence.The other said Qaribi: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ Al -Walid ibn al

killed.Also in the hadith, “September is enough.” In the whole of the righteous from a poem by Ali ibn Issa al -Qimi, who is born: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ِل And in a cultivation of the chapter of Al -Jawhari, he said: “The one who taught us with a goodness, so he made it up, so I went to confinement, so the two robber wanted to study the homes.And the pamphlet of the solution said, p.82: ؎ As if their way is an antelope on the honor of ∗∗∗ denoted by the cousin, Malathum wanted the causes of the two.Al-Rajiz said: (P-2110) ؎ ؎

with what I said to him, and I wanted to pass through.And I have more than the signs of this strange recovery, and I want this to correct the holders of the sacrifice of the sacrifice of the light that is not for you.Graduating the Qur’an on him and not with what refers to it with the enlightenment by making a bitter of the mourning.The eighth saying is that it is references to the states of the zakat of the heart, and made it in the conquests in the second chapter as a gesture to the people of faith, and it is obtained that the sentence of the exalted letters in the righteousness The righteousness of the forefathers is eighteen and seventy letters and the emancipation here is the truth of the place.This is the same as the revelation, so the number of the letters is eighty and the seventy and the seventh.“Faith is a few and seventy people”, so this forever is the people of faith, and it is not complete for one of the secrets of faith until he knows the truths of this forever.How can they claim that it is a widow in the shames that are not known, with the evidence of the thorns of the thief, with the sake of the believer and the suffering of it.The readers indicated to him to ask the liquids and the congregations are left.The judge, Abu Bakr ibn al -Arabi, said, “Were it not for the Arabs that they would have known it with a significant condemnation among them, they would not be the first of those who denied that on the one It was separated and “p” and others, so they were not denying that with their virginity to a stumbling and their kernels in the abandonment of “I said and they have asked about it and what is clear of this Take a testimony (P-211) with it from the house of Zahir and others, so it is from Nawader, the words of the Arabs, and what was brought out the output of mystery and the salt, and this is not the right of the place.The second type shall be made by the statements that the forefathers have been placed in these bodies as names or actions in which the sayings are four.The ninth in the first sayings for the first of the scholars and the speakers and the choice of pride is that it is the names of the light in which it was located in it, and the son of the son of the son said, His book is the chapter on the names of the light from the chapters of what is not behaved or for the creation, and the attribute of the scout is attributed to the most of the most, and the fell of his forefathers in the ware of the righteousness of the righteousness The forefathers have been made with the flag on that light, and it was called as we say The harsh b and the sympathy c, and the locking of what the Arabs named the name of the forefathers, as they called the blame of the good and the father, is hot, and they called the gold: the eyes, Qaf, and I say: A tribe is a tribe from a sacrifice, and Shuraih ibn Awaf al -Anasi or al -Abbasi said: “He remembers me, Hamim, and Ramah is a migrant ∗∗∗, so do not follow the values ​​of the garb.[Al -Shura: 1] Asq [Al ​​-Shura: 2] in which I say I do not ask you for a reward except for the affiliation in the kinship [Al -Shura: 23] and this saying is no longer, so that the time is that there is a matter The name is, and we found this forefather with a reader with the light with the gatherings of Muslims, that he returns to the union of these forefathers in the number of " And that the names of the other fence were not placed in its families.The tenth said, and a group said that it is the names of the Qur’an, which was involved in it.It is invalidated that he had come after some of what it does not cause, even if it was a name for the Qur’an, the part of the pain [Romans: 1] The Romans dominated [the Romans: 2], and the spider [1] The sharp saying is ten, that all the compounds of which are a name of God, they narrated from me that he was saying, O Kahis, O Ham, and I have been silent about the forefathers of the forefathers, so what is the forefathers of the forefather It is appropriate for it to be taught under it from the sayings and its invalidity of the link between it and between it and what is after it because it is (P-22) is a news or the one who is from the name The book [Al -Baqarah: 2] and the sucking [Al -A'raf: 1] a book that was revealed to you [Al -A'raf: 2] The second is ten.What is meant by that book [Al -Baqarah: 2], that is, it is revealed to you, and his words are invalidated that it does not read the form of the verbs that this does not come in all of it, and “ The strangeness of this saying was free with symptoms of it.The third type is in which the statements are shown that its forefathers are the wars of the spelling of what is intended with its names for purposes that call for that and the one who says: It is twenty that his forefathers have divided God, as it was divided into the pen, and you intend to intend it because its names are consistent with the names of God, the Almighty, and the Most High, This is the saying that if it was divided into it, it was reminded of the letter of the division, as it is not deleted except with the name of the Majestic at the Basra, and that it has been in the authority of it, and that it has been in the authority of it.Najo n and the pen [pen: 1] and flesh [Al -Zukhruf: 1] and the clear book [Al -Zukhruf: 2] The owner of the scouts said: And they have developed it among the two divisions on the one who is divided into one of the words And the night if he fades [night: 1] and the day if it is evacuated [the night: 2] that the second waw is the one that includes the names For the names, that is, and the kindness, and the answer to this is that the deletion of the deletion in the name of the Majesty is different in it and that the purchase of the collection of two divisions is the one who will be made by Or the compassion that they had gathered between two divisions, the napstel said: ؎ God and God for the blessings of the boy, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: The argument is the way to the pattern of reciprocity in the purpose of crying for the participants and waking them to look at them that this book is the one who is based on them and the one who has the same Likewise, it is a word that is composed of the eyes of their words, as if it deceived them with the admission of the opposition and is insulted for themselves with the same And the treatment of the region is subject to them with their treatment of the treatment of those who did not know the absence of the language.So he founded it as the Sabyan, at the beginning of their learning with the book until they are my reward for the exhibitor after this, which is a reward, not for the sake To this cold saying, dirt, and varying, he said in the scouts, and this saying is from power and creativity by acceptance in a house, and I said, which is the one who sees it and its choice and the appearance of it.So the wound is that every surah is intended to be miraculous, because God Almighty says, and they come with a wall of the like (P-213), so it will be made by the sake of the miracle of the miracle Because he is in support of this saying, that the argument is appeared in this intention If you mention the spectrum of that of those in the way of learning in a place that is not good for the learning, the knowledgeable that they are the same As he is in the cushion of the two words, he will support this face, the hatred of his forefathers in the majority of the signs of the remembrance of the Qur’an, and it is not like it [Maryam: 1] Walm [Spider: 1] The people were calculated [the spider: 2] and the pain [Romans: 1] For an affairs that we do not know, and perhaps to take into account the eloquence of the words, and supports it that the great parts of these forefathers in the ills of the angel are the same All of them are civil and the family of Amran, and perhaps that is because they descended with the approach of the covenant of the migration from Mecca and that the intention of the definition in the Qur’an is the descendant of the Qur’an, Also, the letters whose names are sealed with a scourge like the yaa, distraction, and the back, the brightness, and the b The boys in the book have a request for lightness, as it will come to the last of this search for the interpretation of pain.The fifteenth saying is that it is a teaching of the cut Even if they were reversed after that, they would have taught them, as the young man learned to be cut off, and then they learned to him, he said to him, he said: He lives, it means that it was not in them who did not write the book except for some of the cities as the people of Lira and some of the rest and some of the villages of the village and the people of the family The conditions of the Arabs in the readers and the writings are varied in the different juices, so they were the same as the people of a book because they were displaced to the Arab country of the Arab The elderly, and Iraq is the cradle of reading and writing, and the history has proven that the son of Irm The Arabs when they did not live in the nose, the dignity of the nose of the nose of the time of time and the writings, and their occupation of their condition on the height of the principles of the sciences, so the rest of the writers in the rest of the book, so that the writers remained in The right and the Hijaz, then when they separated after the seam of the old, they transferred the book to the citizenships that they descended, and it was a delicacy with a foundation, and they knew the reading, Al -Wahida is one of the two people in the country of glory.They taught it to the civilians with a grandfather, and the people of Lira teach the writers, so the Arabs with the Hijaz are the leaders of (P-214) that the line learned about the people of the people, In the books of literature, we remind us of that, as the newspaper read a boy from the beyond.The Awis and Al -Khazraj were with the displacement of the two dirties, they have forgotten the writers when they were the people of agriculture, Russia, and war, so he had been returned and returned in the path that he did not return.The supporters improve the writing of the city and in the prisoners of the partners on the day of those who improve that, so those who had no money from the captives were to be able to know that the tenth of the family is taught Zaid bin Thabet learned in a group, and the cure was the daughter of Abdullah Al -Qurashiya, the writer is good, and she taught it to the mother of the believers.There are what is required in the myths of the Arabs that it is necessary that the people of the Hijaz have learned the writing of the people of the city in their neighborhoods.He had six children, who are: Abg, and Hoz, Hatzi, Wathim, Sa`fas, and I have been.So he made his children a loyalty to the country of a city and what was around it, so he made the gloriousness of Makkah and made a deer and put down with the sects, and he found the three, and he made the three, and he made the three, In the time of Shuaib, and he is one of those who took the torment of the day It requires that the story is a variety of the tendency of the buds of the domers with an easy way that suits their minds and requires that the forefathers of the thickness of the thickness of it The domers of the people of a city, so the people of Hijaz are attached to it, and it is really that it is from the forefathers, other than the many, the usual, or the existence in all languages, except that this is the saying All of the letters are provided in the sacrifice of the light, but the existence of its half, as it will come from the words of the scouts.The sixth saying is that it is an alert from which the Samait alerts, like the call that is intended to be alert And the fear and Abu Ubaidah, Ibn Attiyah said, as he says in the guidance of the most famous of the poems, no, but rather, no, the pride said in the interpretation of the Surah of Al-Anakkab: The place of ignorance or the preoccupation of the mind is presented to the intended words, something to wrap the addressee to it because of that presenter, then it is prescribed in the place The present is a word like the call and the forefathers of the conquest, and the presenter may be a voice as someone who is accompanied by the one who is accepted to accept it.The proceeds of the argument so that its indication of the intention of the alerts is in kind, as there is no concept, so it is incurred by the alerts on an impurity.The four -year -old saying is that it is a miracle of deeds, which is that the illiterate prophet who has not been read by the origins Surprisingly, and this is clear that the illiterate is not difficult for him to go to the forefathers.The eighth saying is that the infidels were subjected to the hearing of the Qur’an, so they said: Do not hear for this Qur’an and the people in it [Chapter: 26], so it is for the sake of this Let them accept a request for understanding, so that he will fall to them, so what they recite without a intention.The ninth saying is that it is a mark for the people of the book, and they are prepared by their prophets that the Qur’an opens with disconnected wars.The twentieth said that Al -Tabrizi said that God will say the introduction of the Qur’an, so they show them that it is composed of the letters of the words of the words, and this is the words of the words, and this is the words of the words, The voices of words are more indicative of its connotations from the consequences of the cuts that are cut off.The twentieth and twenty say, narrated from Ibn Abbas that it is a praise that God praised him for himself and he returns to the first or second saying.This is the collection of sayings, and there is no doubt that the readers of all Muslims have with the names of the spelling of the spelling like a thousand.Lam.Mime without reading the mother and that its drawing in the line is in the image of the forefathers, he will adopt all the sayings of the first types and appoint the prejudice to the two of the two of the two of the two of the two.It is leveled Under you, the two types are varying in the grades of kisses, because the second sayings, the seven, the eighth, and the second are ten, and the fifteent The forefathers, even if it was taken from the names or words, would have the truth to be bound by its heavens, not with its names.If these two types are appointed and we were dropped, what was from the recruited sayings under them are wow, concluded that the most likely from these sayings are three: and it is the same The two men and the registration (P-216) for their miracle of the opposition, or its aspiration for the luminous wounds in it, or as it is the sections of it, the division of it, the sections of it.And the Umayyad Arabs alerted him to the benefits of writing for their exaggeration from the state of illiteracy.And I suggest these three sayings is the first.He said in the scouts: What was mentioned in these savings is one of the names of the forefathers is the half of my adequate manners, as it is four ten, namely: the thousand, the blame, the m and the one, the one, the one, and the sake, The eye, the lord, the cinema, the b and the end, and the noun, in nine and ten walls on the number of feet of the domers, and this four ten years of disgrace on the righteousness It is from the task of its half: the hunter, the sufficient, the distraction, the cinema and the b Handbraft is half: a thousand, the sufficient, the loudness, the endowment, and the softness of its half: the blame, the m and the back, the sterility, the distraction, the eye, the cinema, the b, and the one.And from the applicant is half of it: the one who is the one.And from the exile is half of it: the thousand, the blame, the m, the view, the sufficient, the distraction, the eye, the cinema, the end, the water, and the noun.And from the recipient, it is half the slope, the one who is the one.And among the rackets is half: the thousand, the blame, the m and the back, the sufficient, the distraction, the sample, the eye, the cinema, the b, and the noun.And from the forefront of the anxiety, its half: the endowment, and the brightness.Then the virtues whose remembrance is abundant in the male, so they were the one who has been gone in everything.And the goodness increased to that, other types of forefathers, and we will not be prolonged, so whoever wants, let them return it.And the crops of their words were that it was spent by mentioning what was mentioned of the forefathers and the talcum of the remembrance of what I have the right to the right And to measure what was not reduced to the acquisition of the wiseness, which is the indication of the care of writing, and the right to summarize the words.So the remembrance of the group of these is the sacrifice of the Qur’an from the scientific miracles, which is the reminder in the third face of the faces The tenth is one of the presentations of this interpretation.And how the region is to be conquered by a standard without signs of Arabization of the ruling As it was not a work for the inhabitants of it, as is the case in the numbers, when you say three of the fourth of it (P-217) and the names of the names of the righteousness of the righteousness of the Say, for example: a rib, with a rug, a sword, without Arabization, and whoever Arabs was wrong.Therefore, the readers have broken down with it, a knock on the one who is the one who is on it.And what was one of the names of the forefathers, the last of which is made in the fences of the fence, a parallel, because it is a marketer, the argument of the incorporation of it, and it is in the case of the argument of the ritual Because the argument is a majority to teach the beginner, and seek it in the argument more, so it fell in the sacrifice of the light, which is short, because it is the one who is in the way of the ritual, or it is a place that is in the way of the rituals of the ritual, or it is a short It is taken from it.But people may make one of the lights as the name for it, and they say that I read (as a disobedience [Maryam: 1]) as they make the first word from the poem of the name So they say that I read the rhythm of your Prophet, and that the happiness of the one may be treated.For the regulations of that formula from the names, it is not a matter of Hamim as Sherih ibn Awaf al -Anzi said the old one: Before the advancement, and the quantity said: ؎ We read to you in the family of Hamim, a verse ∗∗∗ its interpretation of us from us is his understanding and is Arabized, and it is not Arabized as a disobedience [Maryam: 1], as we do not have a perspective.As for the poison [poets: 1], it will be Arabized to express the mixed compound, we are attended by Hadrmat and Darborad and Sibuyeh said: If you make the name of the Surah, then the name of the Surah, then the name of the Surah, Hood read to the scientific and ethnic, he said that she was emerging with a woman who was called Omar.And in all of you, you will bring it in the Arabization in the case of the story and the fall of its vastness with the way it follows from the Arabs, so if you make it a virginity, it will be free And she cried to them, and it is a show that it is then anchor and does not accept a symptom, because it is then in the house The mindset is indicated that the skirt is prepared by the signs of what he wants after it, such as the narration of the account numbers on those who want it to be in the authority of it, or the one who has a gathering (28) It is divided, so there is no Arabization with it with what follows it, nor the meaning of the ability to the author of this forever, as this is not a matter When it is prepared from the exposure, because the one who shall the forefathers to those who contradict if it is intended to be intended to teach him, he is the intention that he intends to intend.And if you appreciate it as a name for the paths, the Qur’an, or to God, it is divided into it, then it is said that it has rulings with it It is followed by the Arabs, some of which are needed for the many appreciation, so let you see it for you, for time is short.It is a Qur’an, a Qur’an, not referred, but it is disagreed in that they are independent verses, and the appearance is that they are not in independent verses, but are parts of the verses of the righteous.The doctrine of the readers of the readers.It was narrated from the readers of Al -Koufah that some of them enemy are independent verses and some of them did not prepare it and made him part of what he followed, and he did not appear, and he did not appear.Scouts: This is not an income for the measurement in it.It is correct for the Kufic that all of them are verses, and it is the one who is in the people of this saying, as detailing is judged; Because the indicators are incomprehensible.And the face of me is that they are verses because it has a diet as a kinetic, as the intended is the purification of their creeks or the like, so it is the case of what is in the case of what is the case with what is It is involved in the connotation of speech in the sense of a kinetic that it has a clear meaning, but the consequences of the jungle are considered in this forefathers, we are in appreciation.The consequences of the applicability of the commitment of commitment.The procedure indicates the ruling of the parts of the verses, that they read it if they read the verse that is connected to it.Romans.The pain [Romans: 1] was the dominated of the Romans [the Romans: 2], and in it, the father of the righteous came out, shouting in the aspects of the Mecca of the pain [Al -Rum: 1] The narration of Ibn Hicham from him, “The Messenger of God has read to A Ataba ibn Rabiah Ham [Chapter: 1] Displayed, like a stubborn and stubborn shift [Chapter: 13] Hadith.And on this disagreement, it was disagreed with the parts of its readers in the prayer when those who are satisfied with the reading of the Surah with Al -Fatih with a single verse like the companions of Abu Hanifa.
