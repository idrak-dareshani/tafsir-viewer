The researcher is the defamation of God, some of them, with some of the earth, but God is the best of the two worlds.The loyal verses indicated: to be deposited from the smile, the insightful of the aspiration of the rule of judgment in the modernities of these maqinahs and its proverbs in this world and the one who is the world of this world This verse is a cross from the acres of the universes, and a ruling from the wisdom of the history, and the arrogance of the age that is not guided to one of them before the descent of this verse.It was elevated to the last lesson as his saying (and their prophets said to them [Al -Baqarah: 247]) and what was after the head of the verse.It is amended to nlection in its compassion, from the leaving of kindness, and the peace of the abuse.Nafaa read, Abu Jaafar, and Jacob (and if God's defense of people) was read by the form of the reaction, and Jamour read it to pay the form of the deceased.The defense is the source of the motive, which is exaggerated in a payment, not for the reaction, as the saying of Moses Jabir al -Hanaf Aqli: As he is in his saying, God is defending those who believe in [Hajj: 38], that is, he is pushed because the one who pays a truth is the one who is the one who is noticeable in the definite He was assigned to God because he who destroyed him and destroyed his reasons.Therefore, some of them said some of them, so he made the defense of each other, and it is from the chapter: and you did not throw when you threw, but God threw [Al -Anfal: 17].The origin of the defensive payment is the same for the exclusion from the perpetrator.He said: So I pushed it and defended it while it was a sacrifice from the reconciliation of the motivation and the meaning of the verse: that if it were not for the payment of some people, some of the people of the people of God The payment and its motives in the motivation, the earth was spoiled: that is, whoever is on the ground, and the (P-501) is a system of what it has: so that God is upset when he created the rituals of the rituals, Types, and kinds, created it for the addition, and he was called in its individuals a Sunnah that indicated that God's intention of his hatred is to a long time, and for that we find the ritual All types of prostitutes, with what is type, except in its individuals, the power of finding their proverbs to be these proverbs with a difference of the individuals when they are in its conjugation, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is By reproduction in the animal, the seed in the plant, the sacrifice in the hostility, and the generation in the Kaimawiya supporters.And this power is provided in all the first indications that it was found that he wanted to meet the types, as he wanted to add the individuals at the time Her morning, and we know from this that God is the creator of these universes, he does not love its corruption, and you may provide us with the interpretation of his saying.Heroes and the relative, and God does not love corruption [Al -Baqarah: 205].Then, God Almighty, as he called in all the ancient women, is called, with a contemporary or reflection, to what is in which it is in its goodness and its hatred, as it is the harmony of the wilderness.The animal to the sinner and the caravan, then expands these perceptions, so all that is in which the sheep of the shelter is separated from insight and bids.This is called the Shahi power.He also fell in all the entities of the norms that he pushed into the melting of themselves, and the payment of Al -Awadi from them, on the other hand.The cow is the head of the vertebrae of the feeling of what it attacked from it, as it is contemplated in the superiority of the power of the attacker on the power of the defenders, then the time So you are separated to everything in which the ritualization of the rituals of the people of those who are signed by the harm, and from the request of being, the taking of the weapon, and the resurrection of the enemy, and the enemy of the enemy At the end of what is in the power, which is the angry power, and this increases the power of the defense, in addition to the increase in the fall of the dangers even in the animal.And what God has made in all kinds of supplies is one of the causes of harm to the bad of Him, as evidenced by God that God created it for the will of its survival, and it may be compensated for the human being And the idea of ​​referring to the survivor of those who want him to harm, and on the rhythm of harm in those who want him before he intends him to intend it, and he is the one who expresses it.Then it is up to make every kind of species, or an individuality in which it has been in which it is beneficial to others and its souls to stimulate each other.This is a general law.(P-502) made the human being what he bid farewell to the mind is the one who has the rest of the types.He made knowledge for him in the types of characteristics, and from the individuals of his kind of benefits.So God created the reasons for the defense with a motivation from God, who pushes the harm of harm with the means that the intended one uses.The individuals of the species, so that the greed of the forces in the weak knees, and the conjunction of those who flip up the benefit to itself on the benefits of it, found it, so that it will find it, so it will find it, so it is from it, so it is from it.Every type in the mountain of the shelter is to himself by the negative of the shelter of the shelter for others, from what he has, and to forget the owner of the pilgrim, when the need is in the face He also has.Thus, every lust is overwhelmed by it, and every power is on its weak Likewise, until the most powerful
