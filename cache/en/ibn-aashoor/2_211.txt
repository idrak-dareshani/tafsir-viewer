The Quranic researcher (P-288), the children of Israel, how many of them came from a clear verse and whoever replaces the grace of God after what he came.Before the house of the proof in the sense of the precedent sentence, then his saying, do they look at [Al -Baqarah: 210]) Whether it was a news, a feast, or a long time, or a long time, or a long time, and no one, or a long time, In it on the precedent, and it has been exhausted by an exhaustion of an excessive difference of vastness, and a rush in the infidels, and a lack of enmity with the verses of the signs, so that the signs of the signs are that With their fools to the few who have been informed of the sons of the children of the sons of the sons of the sons of the sons, with the few verses of the signs It has a weak faith, and then they changed the religion after that.And on the authority of the conscience to be in the view of the people of the book: that is, the children of Israel, so the enemy is from the guarantee here to the endowment with the saying of the children Their condition is that they are more severe: that they have seen many verses, so it was appropriate for them to be raised with faith in the faith.Because they know the people in the fields of the messengers, and on all of this verse and what is after it is incurred between the purposes of the legislation followed in this surah.And (Sel) is a matter of what he asked, asking his origin, asking, and the gossip is relieved, after the transfer of its movement to the silence before it, in order to give it to it.For the likeness of the hazardousness with the perfection of the heart, when the first of the horrors moves, he took advantage of the assumption of the ghost of the prayer The matter is afraid of fear, and the Arabs are more than this diminishing asking about the past and the matter; However, if the matter is signed after the waw and the loyalty, then leave this diminishing dominant.And the one who is commanded by the question is the Messenger; Because he is the one who monitors that the children of Israel answers him from his question; They do not fill in a question other than him; Because what is meant by the question is the question of the report for the bribery, and the question is the question comes because the tools of the infringement come to him.What is meant by the report is to show their acknowledgment of their violations because of the contradictions of the verses, so it comes from this report.Rather, they are the same as their being.(P-289) It is intended for the children of the people who are present.And the guarantee is in them to them, and the intended is the coming of their predecessors; Because the steadfast qualities of the predecessors of the doves and the nations are valid to prove them to the successor to arise of the effects of all as it is very high in the last nations of the nations.It is permissible for them to be the meaning of the verses that they are transmitted by the verses of their messengers in their books and they are certain of them, as if they had gave it as a foreigner.And (how) is a name for the vague number It will be for the question, and it will be for the news, and if it is for the news, it indicates a large number of vast number; Therefore, you need a distinction in the news, and it is here, as it is indicated by the question of the question, so the questioner about it is the number of verses.And he had the right to ask that he excels to two things from the door of Ka Ka, that is, the origin of his acts is starting and informed, and a sentence, how many of them have come to be the second.As the question is not required, but it is the eye of the request, then the verb is attached to the second verb for the sake of the understanding, and the sentence of what we have in The second is a boredom.And commenting abounds in the words of the verbs of knowledge and thinking if it comes after the verbs, or the negation, or the mother of the divorce, or the mother of the division, and the right of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge The verbs, he said in Al -Tasheel: They share it in it, that is, to comment with the question, look, think, see, and ask, and he asked.[Al -Dhariyat: 12] And when he took, he asked here the first act of it, he was suspended from the second verb, because the reasoning is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one To comment is not a state of the first effective, it does not reconcile because it is a second effective for the act of the student who is active.Some of it is in some of it, so it is not a beginner in which nothing before it is done.In it is a meaning and estimation, so the sentence was the rest of the place of the work, and the tool of the confession between the rest of the duties of the relationship is stronger in its distance from the meaning He asks for it, because the words with it are not the news of the news, except that what is caused by the tool of the questioning in the sense of the media is the meaning With the self, but it is a weakness with its fell after a factor, so the question became a photo, so this is not the authority of the worker except for the sake of you, so he said: He knew that after it was achieved, and the questioning became a picture (P-290), and the comment became evidence of that, and if the concession was left on the basis His summary is a work for the suspended treatment.And a standardization, but it is for the extension of the question, and the meaning: I knew the one who understands people from it, uh, so he comes from his words that you say: He knew something that people ignore or adhered to his knowledge, with the difference of your saying: I knew more, and I may be the one who is the one who is the question of the question.So the sentence of the questioning is a bay of the question of the question.It comes in this verse.It is permissible to join the meaning of the saying, that is, it will be the second verb, as I have been given the most effective: one of them is a suitable for me, and it is not appropriate for me.The meaning of the guarantee.Al -Tafazani was allowed in the explanation of the scouts that a sentence of how many of them came to the intention of the question from the question, that is, they asked the answer of this question.The sentence is located in the event of the verb, that is, and do not know the verb.The owner of the scout was permissible to be (how) is a experience, that is, it will be the words of words, and the verb of the question was cut off from his suspension of what he had to do with what he did not.They are in the thanks of the grace of God, so that the brilliance obtained.And it would be how many of them have come to come in a distress with a village, and whoever replaces the grace of God, and after it, it is an expert in it that the father of Hayyan denied it, and he said: The sentence is obeyed in it “how much” of the sentence of the question with the fact that the question is the question about the blessings.And from a clear verse that is distinguished (how) I entered it from “who” is the same as the way of the seizure of the way It appeared in some of the positions to be permissible, because every letter installs a host whose appearance is permissible except in the places of the same as the same.He was separated between the “how” expertise and the inferiority and between its distinctiveness with a prepared verb.His Excellency said how much they left from paradise and eyes [smoke: 25] and how much our family is from a village.That is, lest it noticed by the verb of that separate action, or is it to be an alert from the beginning of the matter on the fact that it is a distinction, not the effect of relief, from the understanding of the name, And when the appearance of the appearance of “from the case of the chapter is the distant of the distinctive, it is not other than it, and it was said: the appearance of“ from ”(P-291) and it is obligatory with the chapter with the act of the one who is the one.Other than him, as Abd al -Hakim said about the right and the Tafizani in the explanations of the scout.In the sufficient, the appearance of “from” in the distinction of “how” the experience and the inferiority is permissible as well as the son of the son of the Hajib, but the satisfaction he said: He did not find it “The sectarianism is only with the chapter by the verb.The example that was satisfied with the satisfaction, but rather used to appear "from" in the distinctive, which is the back.And the verse: here is the miracle and the evidence of the messenger, or the words indicating The comeback of Muhammad ﷺ, it is a verse for Moses; If he was told before a century, and a hayah for Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, as he was preaching before and his presence with a verse, and he described it in the past The adjective is a verb that any back, so the appearance of the appearance of the appearance of the first face, and the appearance of the significance on the second face, and in this question and the form of it His saying: And whoever replaces the grace of God, his estimation, so they changed it and did not work with it.And his saying and whoever replaces the grace of God is a way to a sentence of Salail, how many of them have given them, etc.With his saying: Save the children of Israel, and he stated that the children of Israel had changed the grace of God, the Almighty, and that was indicated by that that the verses that were given to the children of the sons of the people are not.To deny their experiences with the ruling of those who change the blessings of God is appropriate, and this is what is intended by the rhetoric, so he sings like him in the words of the remembrance The deletion and the briefing of the palace together; Because it is beneficial that it is said: How much we have come from a clear verse that is a blessing on them, so they did not appreciate it, the right Punishment; Because whoever replaces the grace of God, God is punished, and because he is beneficial to this general judgment that includes those who are intended and others who are like that The universal speech after a partial judgment that it presents in the original is an expulsion that is similar to the exposure, and its counterpart is that it speaks to you with a hadith, so he said: So, so that he said: You want that he had lied to you, but that this supplication had not been for that prayer when he was heard that hadith is signed.Rather, it was proven to the verses that it is a blessing; Because if it was the righteousness of the Messenger, then it is a blessing because (P-292) is the evidence of the honesty is the one that guides people to the acceptance of the call of the Messenger from the one who is not.Follow it, and increase those who followed the messenger of faith, he said: “He who believed in the faith, and those who believed in their faith [Tawbah: 124].The righteousness of the world and the hereafter, and that is an urgent grace and later, and if the verses are the words indicating the evil with the Messenger, then it is a blessing upon them, because it is the intention of it.They have the messenger from the messenger, so that they would not be repeated in its honesty after the signs of the signs that they were kept on their memorization.And the way of the first direction is the same as the description that they exposed those verses, so the intended is changed from them, as it became symptoms that caused the slander of the people, and the people of the people, for the sake of the people.If you were not given to them, it would be better for them in the world; As they will be a naivety, they are close to doing the good of them after the intention of the perseverance And symptoms; Because they are baptized to the pillar of evil, and in the hereafter, too, because the punishment for infidels stops the supplication and the appearance of the miracle, and the appearance of this, and the appearance of this Participation in their symptoms of the Qur’an and manipulation in its guidance or the extermination that they used those verses in the other than what is meant by the one that is what is good for them to make it.Their messengers came to those verses, except for the preference of his nation, so they fell on that and they are lost on the religion, so they said: We are the sons of God and love him [18] Enemies [Al -Baqarah: 80].And the extermination of making something instead of another, that is, it is broken by it, so it will be the same as the same and the one and the height of the Creation and the misery of the stimulus of the opponent, for he wanted to turn the condition of the youth in the case of the young, and the saying of the jungle: I pledged to it a neighborhood, and it is a dignity, so it is a dignity, so it is a dignity.Al -Najah Al -Jawafel, and his saying is the grace of God from before the place of the phenomenon.To show that the grace of God is in the face of the verses of the verses and others from the blessings.And his saying after what the coming came in it is a seduction of clarity, witness and possibility, because it is from the boundaries of the coming.Rather, the punishment was made, arranged for the conversion after this ability to indicate that it is a way for a vision (P-293) that is not ignorant of the ignorance or the way of the way They came and then deported him after what they have said while they knew [Al -Baqarah: 75].The grace was delegated to be deleted to include all the conditions of the extermination of some of it, and the symptoms of some and misfortune.The punishment is caused by the beginning of that blessings in its descriptions or in itself, and it is not a substitute except for the intention of its violations, otherwise it is not the same, but it is not the same.His Almighty said, did you not see to those who have changed the grace of God as a disbelief [Ibrahim: 28] because that verse was not presented in it what is permissible to give permission that the grace is not Here you can appoint the expulsion with its extension, and those who are in that verse are not intended from those who are in this way, because that is in the Kafr al -Qayr.After it, and made it to God [Ibrahim: 30].And his saying is that God is the hardship of punishment, the evidence of the condition, and it is his highest, because he made this general judgment as a answer to the condition that he knows that whoever is a stain He enters into the general answer, for the abuse of punishment is a matter of knowledge, so his remembrance is not intended from the good, because it is a knowledge The intended is the destruction of the everlasting, and it is referred to the meaning: God will punish him, because God is the hardship of punishment, And the meaning of the severity of his punishment: that the perpetrator does not spoil and that is because it is the one who is punished for punishment Punishment for the guarantee that is added to it, which is punished.And the appearance of the name of the majesty here with the necessity of the phenomenon to be said: It is the hardening of punishment, to introduce the ritual in the conscience of the poisonous and the rabbi of the ritual, and for the sake of this The college is independent of itself, because it is in the same house that is taught by people before, and the punishment is the reward that is painful for the sake of the rituals, and the grace of the name Genius.
