The researcher, the Hajj, the pilgrimage and the Umrah for God.His head is a fool from fasting, charity, or humanity, this is a return to the words of life, so it is a kind of saying: “And the righteousness is that the righteousness is that it is the righteousness of it.” 189] etc., and what is between them is a bound or a symptom, that the rulings are kind to some of them for some Quranic paths, so that you can make this Before her is a story of a story.There is no disagreement that this verse was descended in the six -year -old when the Muslims were repelled Umrah, and that before the pilgrimage is imposed (P-217), so what is meant by the words is the Umrah, but the pilgrimage was mentioned on the face of the integration, and it is not the same.This is one of the miracles of the Qur’an.And the completion of the talism of the thing, and the two residues of what remained of it until all of it is equal.And like this matter related to the description of a verb that falls in their words on two bodies: one of them: It is the most that is the one who is the one who is the same The description is like the perfection in his words, the Almighty: and the pilgrimage is complete, that is: they are full if you are granted in it, and also the saying of the Almighty: Then come to the fast to the night: [187] And the Almighty said: “So they will give them their covenant [Repentance: 4] and the same is to say: I hurry the walk for those who walk with a pleasant walk, and the second is: In order to obtain the verb from the first and a richness on that adjective, we will say it to the Almighty: and my blessing is fulfilled on you [Al -Baqarah: 150] and for you Call me so, adding to him, addressing it that he did not seek after the walk after, if you command it to the events of a fast walk from the first and the first, and the angel of it - And their saying: Expand the amount of the meal and narrow its pocket; That is: I find it as well as one of the first things, and this is a warning from the storm of the expression, which is not in a bond or metaphor, but it is a matter of all things, which is less and it is less.Because the one who is required to be a formula is the same as the event from which the material of that formula.And the verse leads to the two recipients, if the first is a matter of entrusting Hajj and Umrah, in the sense that it is not a pilgrimage and a longing, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, or a richness, and a richness, By entrusting them and the promise of the return from them after the essence of them, and they do not repel them from them, the enemy, and if the second is a matter of their fullness of them; That is, they are completed by what was agreed upon.The first meaning is the appearance and attributed to the verses before it, and as if this urgency is indicating that the intended is the best of the pilgrimage Umrah here are the goodness in the pilgrimage, as well as in the Umrah on the saying of its jurisprudence.And the blame in the pilgrimage and the Umrah is to define the genius, and they are the worshipers of two famous people with the addressees who are distinguished from the rest of the guns, so the pilgrimage is the Zayyar al -Ka’i In one time for the group and in which the elders are known, and the Umrah is the vision of the kaaba in other than a specific name, and it is for every individual with its own, and the origin of the pilgrim.And its broken: the integrity is rented to something or a lot of intensity.On (P-218) Ibn al-Sakit: The pilgrimage is a lot of conflict and frequency, the pilgrimage of the children of so-and-so is said to so-and-so: That is, its integrity is AH.So he made him a beneficial purpose of a group, such as the saying of the tranquilizer and the name of the racket: and the most witnessed of many solutions, and they do so One of the most famous worshipers at the Arabs is what they inherited from the project of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, as God told that of his saying: He said in the people: The Arabs are the oldest of a nation that has a habit of pilgrimage, and they believe that the vision of the kaaba is an endeavor to God Almighty.They are in their Lord, so they are like the tanning of the humiliating, and they were worsening with the warning of the sewn of the clothes, and they did not touch the good, and they did not come close to the women, and they did not.With the house and pursuit between the luxury and the bitterness, and a well -being and a sacrifice with me.Perhaps some Arabs did not eat the period of pilgrimage or a fat - that is, because he eaten the racists - and does not persevere in a stance, and for those who do not perform the pilgrim, who is a pilgrim, who does not perform it It is clouded from the sun, and among them is those who perform a silence that does not speak, and do not drink the wine in the most famous pilgrimage, and they have the pilgrimage to your impurity and the rulings that we mentioned in Tarik The contemporary for the Arabs is many, and the most famous of the nations in that Jews, they were pilgrimage to the position in which the coffin of the era; That is, to the elderly of Arshilim, which is the maximum mosque three times in the Sunnah, so that they may be then that there are the two sits, only there, and from this time.And the Christians took many pilgrims, the most famous of which are their visits to the descendants of Jesus, peace be upon him, and the Executive of Arshilim, as well as the Executive of the grave of the grave With the stomach, and from the pilgrimage of the Christians, who are not known to many people, and it is the oldest of their pilgrimage that they were before Islam, they used to perform the city And those who think that those who were invoked their pilgrimage are the Christians of the Levant from Al -Ghusanah to the intention of the people of the people of the vision of the kaaba, and it was mentioned by Sahim Abd al -Has.The two greenery in his saying describes the muds of the sword: ؎ As if the wicked with it is a matter They killed them, and this was mentioned by the imams of the language, and the Egyptians and the two shadows had Hajj to the obstructing country with them.Like Olbia, and the same as the wedding, and there are many grooves.What is meant by this verse is the completion of the Umrah that came out of its judgment, and the mention of the pilgrimage with it is a integration; Because the pilgrimage was not a day; As the pilgrimage was in the hands of the two participants, in his remembrance, he was about to be in the hands of the Muslims.As for Umrah, it is a derived from the perpetrator, and it is the occupation of the place against the brotherhood, but it is with this weight that is not called except for the vision of the kaaba in the same way The Arabs, and they made its meeqaat what was the most famous of the Hajj and the forbidden, and a whistle, and they would say: If the arrogance was exonerated, the effect of the effect, and the yellowing of the time Upper.Perhaps they made that to be Umrah after the return from the pilgrimage and the comfort of the souls.And the harmful people, on making a righteous, is the month of Umrah, and for that, it was forbidden, and he was called a bad, and he followed the rest of the Arabs, for the rest of the Arab Safe from his enemy; Therefore, they called a righteous, and they saw the life in the most famous pilgrimage.And his saying: (to God), meaning: for the sake of God and His worshipers, and the Arabs from the era of the ignorance do not intend to perform Hajj except for God or Umrah except Him; Because the kaaba is the house of God and his forbidden, the piety is here with his saying: (God) is clear that the pilgrimage and Umrah are not for the sake of the two parties, and if they are, and if they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the The sanctuary, and they are those who prevented the Muslims from it, so that the Muslims are not guilty of the pilgrimage in which they have been hurt in the harm of the participants, so he said to them: that there is no Hajj and Umrah; Because you do not perform Hajj for God, not for the sake of the participants, and because the righteous thing that is desirable in it if he is paid by what he sees, he will not be informed of it, so that he will not be.That is the opposite of him, and from his removal of the fighting referred to it with the preceding verses.It is permissible for the piety to be his saying: (for God) to repeat the intention of what was destroyed by the intentions of the people in the ignorance of the closer to the idols, for the two of the people, for the two of the people, for the two of the people Haba on the kaaba, and put on the ravine and the righteousness of the row and the bitterness.The integrity may be from this piety, both of the two.(P-220) There is no pilgrimage in the verse with your money and the father of Hanifah, may God be upon the pilgrimage and the pilgrimage, but the evidence of the Hajj is the ruling of the Hajj and the authority This is the verse, and it is upon it, so the verse is carried out on them on the authority of these two worshipers for those who forbade them, and the money of them is the one who has come to them.Seventh worship with us: prayer, fasting, reward, Hajj, Umrah, Al -Tawaf, and Al -Tamam, and the father of Hanifa has lost all the nawfil.And whoever does not see the nawfil with the honesty and does not see the Umrah and a duty that makes the ruling of its completion as the ruling of the origin of the hurricane in it, and the matter will be in the matter Participated from the request is used on the readers, and from these who read: (and Umrah) by raising, so that you do not be as it is the matter of the matter of the matter of the matter of the matter, the matter of the matter of the matter, the matter of the matter, the matter of the matter, the matter of the matter of the matter, the matter of the matter, the matter of the matter of the matter, He is sealed with Hajj.The Shafi’i made it an indicative of the path of Umrah as the Hajj, and the face of the one who is the one who has been done to Him that God commanded its perfection, so that the matter is with the end of the matter.That is: the gathels of the parties and the ancients, so what is meant by the perpetrator is to complete the legal meaning on one of the two recipients, they said: If there is no words, there is no words In order, and because it is a member of the rulers (and the pilgrimage), or that it is intended to be complete here, here is the last of the worship, so it is the same as the matter.Because the perfection stops the hurricane, and the duty is not fulfilled except with it, then it is obligatory, so it is the matter of completing as a matter of the matter.The truth is that carrying the matter in that matter with the origin of the essence, not in its description - a little sorry as you know, and the readings: (and evaluate) for its abnormalities, not to be a reason, and it is not for me to be.The house of the news of the ones is revealed, if it is not valid for the one who was attributed to it, and on the first involvement, then it is that it is to be done to complete the affairs With the sake of goodness to the bearing on the back; That it is indicated in a sense: If you are laid down, come to Hajj and Umrah, then it will be from the connotation of the performance, and it will be a truth and briefing, and it is the one who is permissible for us to do so, and it is the one who is permissible.Because they were the nations of Umrah, on the positive of the flow, with the affirmative of the afflicted, to be the one who stipulated that it is the intention, the intention is the intention, so the intention is the one who is the one who is the intention.“Do you” here are intended to have a positive.Because what is not required is only for him, it is obligatory, as the ID indicated to him.(P-221) It is true that the verse is not a sign of the rule of Umrah, and the scholars have disagreed in its ruling: Malik and Abu Hanifah went to the fact that it is a Sunnah, he said: Leave it, and this is the gold of Jabir ibn Abdullah and Ibn Masoud from the companions, and al -Nakha’i from the two followers.Al -Shafi’i, Ahmad, Ibn al -Jahm, from the Money, went to their garment, and with it Omar, Ibn Omar and Ibn Abbas said from the companions, Giving, jaws, Mujahid, and Al -Hassan, Ibn Sirin and Al -Shaabi and Said bin Jabir, Abu Barada, Mesraq and Ishaq ibn Rahayah and Dalil, God, “It was said: O Messenger of God, the Umrah is a duty like Hajj, so he said: No, and that you are permeated, then it is better.” The prophet was not commanded ﷺ, and its bearing does not prove it with weak successes, and it was narrated from Ibn Masoud that he would say: If not for the embarrassment, I would not have been That is something that I said: Umrah is a duty AH.The place of the pilgrims said: I did not hear.Etc., and because God Almighty said: And to God for the pilgrimage of the house [Al -Imran: 97] and he did not remember the life, and because it is not two worshipers who are one of the one.Because the obligatory worship is to be anchored, and our companions also begged with a hadith: “Islam is built on five”, and the hadith of Jabril in faith and peace is not in faith Umrah, and the hadith of “The Arab who said: I do not increase or decrease: He said:“ Will it be true ”and he did not remember the age and did not take the Shafi’i from this one.As it was counted in the pilgrimage, and the words of some of the companions and with the stomach.Omar ibn al -Khattab interrupted this verse to prevent enjoyment, which is the warning of the Umrah and then the solution from it in the period of Hajj, then the pilgrimage in the general of that is before it.Al -Bukhari was removed from the hadith of Abu Moses Al -Ash'ari.I said: I did like the prophet, he said: I was good; Is it with you from this?I said: No, then I commanded me, and I was flooded with the house, the description, and the bitter, then I commanded me, so I analyzed, and I came to a woman from my people, so I combed me, or was the one who washed, So I had fulfilled the people until the disagreement of Omar, so I mentioned it to him, and he said: If we take the book of God, then he commands us to do, and he said: We take the Sunnah of the Messenger of God ﷺ, because he did not come until the guidance of the guidance is his place, he wants Omar, and God knows that Abu Moses qualified for the sake of God.“ Peace be upon him, that he was a component and was not permissible, and this is a building on the largest that specializes in the victims with the ones as he said in the hadith of Fatimah, the son of Qayyah.And his saying: If you are confined to the guidance of the guidance, it is a kindness on (complete) and the fulfillment of the male separation, for it is what he commanded to do the pilgrimage That is the perfection.Not the pilgrimage; Because his time He misses the majority of the objection, with the unity of life, and the blockade in the words of the Arabs is to prevent the self from action, it is said: It is confined to it, it is forbidden.In the way of God [Al -Baqarah: 273], meaning: Poverty prevented them from traveling to the stress, and Ibn Mayada said: ؎ He will be immortalized, so that you will be the same It is not an adequate.Because he is a target of his limit, and their counterparts, he repelled him and repelled him, this is the saying of those who achieved from the imams The enemy, and many of the arrogance of the “confined” in the prohibition from the enemy, said: They took them and confined them to them [Repentance: 5], so it is a truth in the two meanings, but the one who is the one said Al -Zamakhiri in the scouts, and from the linguists who said: “Achievement” is a truth in preventing other than the enemy, and the “restriction” is a fact in preventing the enemy, and it is the saying of the And the zigzag, and from the linguists who reflected, and he is the son of Faris, but he is very abnormal.The condition came with a letter “because“ because the condition of the condition is unaware of them, so the words were given to them the meeting of the news that is doubtful in its fall, and the one who is the one They will prevent them from Umrah, and jurisprudence has been destroyed in the meant manner in this verse on the part of the disagreement in the place or in the recovery, and the one who is in the end of me.I call what is forbidden from an enemy or otherwise with the sins of his saying, the highest of his punishment: If you are honest, then it is a strong and strong in that the person is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who wants to be from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who wants to be This blindness is in which the right to summarize in collecting the rulings of the blockade, then its separation, as it will show it when it is the Almighty saying: If you believe, and if this is the one who is safe God, and that is not invoked in the root of the rule of the blockade without an enemy with this verse, but rather he was embarrassed by the Sunnah, and he said: And the like without preventing the enemy, based on the fact that the launch of the blockade of this prohibition is the most in the language.Because this verse made it a guidance, and the Sunnah did not return the guidance of the guidance of the guidance of the enemy (P-223); That is, the guidance of the guidance for the sake of the blockade.A breath or a break from everything that prevents him from standing with people with the path of tawaf and pursuit of the demise of the obstacles and the obligatory judiciary in the absence Muaba ibn Hasaba al -Mukhsumi that it was made with some of the Mecca method while he was forbidden, so I asked Ibn Omar and Ibn al -Zubayr and Marwan ibn al -Hakim.And it is redeemed, so if it is correct, it is permissible His warning, then he has a pilgrimage, and that Omar ibn al -Khattab commanded that Abu Ayoub and Habar ibn al -Aswad when they missed the adherence of a well -known, with a disagreement, with the disagreement of the That the Prophet ﷺ did not command anyone of his companions, nor who was with him to spend something or to return to anything, and our companions directed that with separation; Because the objection is in the disease and its surroundings from the same pilgrim; So it was required to be complete, but in the blockade of the enemy, the obstacles are external, and the appearance in the recipient is that the verse, and if it is reconciled to every prevention, but it is forbidden, but it is forbidden, but it is forbidden to prevent it.Its appearance supported the Sunnah, and the Shafi’i said: There is no elimination of them, and it is the appearance of the verse for the conflict of the guidance, and it is a confidence in the concept of the verse and the absence Abu Hanifa said: Every prevention of an enemy or a disease in which the judiciary and the guidance are required, and it is not obligatory for him to have a tawaaf, nor an effort after the disappearance of his excuse, but his virgin To him.It is not necessary for what is required by the hadith of the Hadaybiyah; Because the verse, if it was descended after it, then it is a copy of the hadith, and if it came down before it, it is one that does not devote the Qur’an to it Founded; Because those who witnessed the Prophet ﷺ then increase the number of frequency, and they were not transferred from that with them that what the references are available.Al -Shafi’i said: What is meant here is to prevent the enemy with the cows of his saying: If you believe, and because it was descended in the year of the Haddiyyah, which is the blockade of an enemy; Therefore, the guidance is due to the confined, but the enemy is limited to the text of the verse.And upon him: If his virginity is removed, the circumambulation should be done by the house and the pursuit.And he did not say the journey of the judiciary on him; It is not in the verse or in the hadith.And his saying: So what is easy for the guidance of the condition, which is a disgrace to one of the chains of the chain of transmission (P-224), and it is the chain of transmission to it without the chain of transmission, so no His saying: From the guidance and his estimation in the scouts: I have to do you, and it appears that the verb is appreciated; That is, guide what is facilitated by the guidance, and both of the two estimates are indicative of the guidance of guidance.And his duty in the pilgrimage is back and in the life like that; By what must be completed after the warning of the fans.And (Istir) is here in the sense of easyness, for the Sun and the Ta’a to confirm, causing it to be difficult for him in the sense of difficulty; That is, what was possible from the guidance that you can get it, and you can find it, so it is a pleasure here, which is intended for all the faces of the facilitation.And the guidance is the name of the impermissible, which is close to God in the Hajj, so it is a verb of my soul, and it was said: It is a collection of guidance, as the grandfather of the shed is gathered, so if it is from me Bayaniya, and if it is a group, “from“ is a whiteness, and the least known to them from the guidance of the sheep, and for that, God has not shown it here, And this guidance, if his leg has been intended for Hajj and Umrah with him, then I will be confined to him, then he will be sent to him if he is able From his duty and his numbers, and the intended of this is the same as the interests of the pilgrimage with the amount of the possibility, then if you miss your sufficiency, he will not miss what is good for the sake of the sake of it.And his saying: And do not spoil your heads, with a bias of the state of the state of war, until the guidance is removed, He is a gift for his saying: Whoever is from you is sick or with him from his head, and he knows the ruling of the righteousness of the rest of the sake of the measure of the measure, and the righteousness, and the righteousness, And it is not possible for the replacement; For the clarity of the mandate.What is meant by this is the case of some of the conditions of your sufficiency, and it is the path of the intended Shiites in your insults.The place is with the opening of the mim and the breaking of H It was said: (his place) is the place of the sacrifice of gifts; It is from me, and the first is the saying of Malik.And his saying: Whoever is from you is sick or with him from his head of the verse.Its head is a seed of the dirty and the lump.That is, a harmful thing about his head.(P-225) And in Al-Bukhari on the authority of Kaab ibn Ajra, he said, “I was carried to the prophet and the sake is spread over my face.He said: Fasting three days or feeding six holders for every holder, half a saa of food and your head, so this is a public.AH and from the sects of the Qur’an, leaving the expression of what is a removal from the conservation.And his saying: Faddah is a fasting, the one who is deleted to him for his appearance, that is: to him, and the meaning: let him shake his head, and upon him, and a pioneer.His saying: And do not glorify your heads, and God has fully infection and its destiny, and his hadith showed him as a son of the son Nun - worship and calls the intended sacrifice from which worship, which is what is meant here, is derived from your descendants as a victory and generosity, if he worshiped and sacrificed to God, and the people of God Relating to the slaughter that is close to it to a slave, and in the hadith, “And the other one day you eat from your humanity” means the victim.* * * If you are safe, then whoever enjoys the Umrah to the pilgrimage, then it is easy for the guidance, then whoever does not find it, then the fasting of three days in the Hajj and the seven if you return His family is my present The mosque is the fulfillment of the compassion on (you are in line with you) if it is intended from the security of the subordinate blockade, and perhaps it came down after the abuse of the Hajj; Because there is a remembrance of enjoyment and the remembrance of the fasting of the enjoyment if he did not find three days in the period of pilgrimage and seven if he returns to his horizon, and that is not They can do the Hajj, and fulfillment of the masculinity of the masculinity.He came with (if) because the condition is desired in it, and security is against fear, and it is also peace from everything that is afraid of it.Safe as a joy, safety, security, security, and security by breaking the proud, and it is deficient in the lineage to the safe of it, so it is intended to say to the one who says: “Who” The faithful, she says: I believed so that if you made it safe from you, and it appears that security is against fear of the enemy, which was not said by his suspension, and in the Qur’an, and in the Qur’an, and in the Qur’an, and in the Qur’an, 6] If a comment is not mentioned to him, we will be removed from the house of the obligatory, so he referred to the blood of fear from the fighting, and it may be presented in the saying of the Almighty: the Lord of this.(P-226) This is an indication of what is meant by blockade, while what is included in the prevention of the enemy, and for that it was said: “If you believe” and supports it that the verses have come down in the age of It was presented, so there is no concept of the condition here; Because it came out for a clear and extensive time, the verse indicated the rule of Umrah; Because it is only with the security, and that is that the Muslims came in the year of the Umrah of the judiciary, who are dominated and nods, if they enabled the pilgrimage to perform Hajj, and they will know that The municipality is removed from the measure of the ruling of the caliph.And his saying: Whoever enjoys an answer “if” and the appreciation: If you are safe after the blockade, I will fulfill the time of Hajj and I can do so, so that they will be promised and wait for a year.Umrah, whoever enjoys Umrah, has a guidance for the guidance of Hajj, so it is clear that the chest Umrah, and that his saying: If you are safe, I want to obtain the security of security with the place of the two places of Umrah, and you have missed the time of the Hajj, meaning that it is the time of the time, and it is not the time, and it is not the time.Whoever is safe and has the rest of what he can do with Hajj; He must perform Hajj.And the meaning of the Umrah was enjoyed to the pilgrimage, which was used to urge urgently, and the benefit of it is either in the sense of the benefit with its rewards, or by the descendants of it, if it is a matter of it.As he has performed it in the travel of Hajj, or in the sense of the integrity of the solution from it, then the return of the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage, so he benefited from the vicinity of the ritual of the period of time, and this is a long time.He permitted Umrah in the period of Hajj after that was prohibited in the era of the ignorance; As they saw life in The best pilgrimage is one of the great immorality.The lobby in its saying: (by Umrah) is a verb (enjoyment), and its saying: to the pilgrimage attached to a deletion that indicates that it is (to) to the one who is in the face of the argument.That is: his days; It is the tenth of the pilgrimage, and it is understood from the word "that" between the Umrah and the Hajj is a time in which the domicile is forbidden, and it is the replacement between the one who is between the age and the ritual He has what he facilitated from the guidance for the sake of the replacement that between the two warnings, and this is where the time of the blockade was not guided when I see it, and God knows best.The linguist; That is, the integrity and pointed to what Muslims called for enjoyment and the Qur’an, which is one of the parts of Islam that the ignorant project has been overlooked, and the name of the expansion of its The enjoyment is to prohibit the pilgrim with a urge in the most famous pilgrimage, then he will be permissible from it, then he performs Hajj from his year before that before the return to his horizon, and he singled out the Qur’an in the way One and begins in his act with Umrah, then it is permissible from it and it is permissible for him to be paid the pilgrimage (P-227) at the age, all of that, God has been blessed, and for the sake of God.The ignorance of him from preventing Umrah in the most famous pilgrimage, and God imposed on him the guidance for algebra because he was screaming from the hardship of the return to the Mecca of the Mecca of the Mecca of the Mecca of the Mecca of the The ignorance, and that he called it enjoyment.The predecessor has fallen in the enjoyment and in his class, for the gambling is on his psalm, and that he is dissolved from his age, which he deprived in the most famous of the pilgrimage, then he is forbidden in That was, and Uthman ibn Afan did not see enjoyment and forbids him in his disagreement, and perhaps he was interpreted by this verse with the same as the first of it, as is the first of the first, as it is the first of the first, as it is the first.And it was contrary to Ali and Amran ibn Husayn, and in Al -Bukhari on the authority of Amran ibn Husayn: We enjoyed the covenant of the Prophet and the Qur’an descended, then he said: He wants Uthaman and Omar ibn al -Khattab does not see the comparison if it is forbidden with urine and an argument with the end of the lines and the pursuit between the locking and the bitterness that it is permissible from the forbidden of it.So the father of Moses Al -Ash'ari said to him that I came from the right, and I found the Messenger of God with a maaka makram; That is: the year of the mine, so he said to me: What do you have?I said: I have been given the righteousness of the Prophet, so he said to me: Is there a guidance with you?I said: No.So I commanded me, I was shed and sought, so I analyzed and washed my head and combed me with a woman from Abd al -Qais, and when the father of Moses spoke to him, he said: He commands us to complete, and if we take the Sunnah of his Messenger, then it is not permissible until the guidance of the guidance is his place, and the companions of the companions and the jurisprudence are the one who is a good About Abu Musa, And with the hadith of Ali, “The Messenger of God ﷺ said: Were it not for the guidance of the guidance, I will be analyzed.” It is permissible to replace the Umrah in the enjoyment until it is permissible from the pilgrimage, and that is the meaning of his saying: It is not permissible until the guidance of the guidance is the place The structure of the pilgrimage is contrary to his intention, which was what he expressed to completely, and perhaps he did not see the Sundays specialized for the frequency of writers or Sunnahs; Because the action of the Prophet ﷺ is frequent, as he witnessed many of his companions and transferred his pilgrimage and that he qualified all of them.Yes, the father of Bakr and the age of seeing the individuals of the pilgrimage is better than the enjoyment and the Qur’an, and with him he took your money, narrated from Muhammad ibn al -Hasan that it is the most likely With the work of the two sheikhs, and Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with him, sees the enjoyment of the exclusive, if it is possible from the prayer to the house, then it is the same.So he makes his pilgrimage a Umrah, and he performs Hajj in the suspended year, and the first saying of the Almighty: to the pilgrimage, that is: to the time of the next Hajj, and the phrase say: to the pilgrimage.And his saying: Whoever does not find the fasting of three days of the verse, she is overwhelmed by whoever enjoys because whoever enjoys with his answer, while he is not a person, then he is not.The guidance of the guidance was entertained.Ten days; Three of them in the days of Hajj and seven after the Hajj.He said: In the pilgrimage, that is: in its most famous, if the one can do it before the time of the pilgrimage, then the pilgrimage is not realized, then the pilgrimage is real The verse.And his saying: That is a full ten, so that is the same account; That is, his collection, then the compassion, if he mentioned two numbers, said when he wanted to collect the numbers: then that - that is: the enemy - such, so it was made for this saying: Pastness; If he says in the name of God, and he said; If he said, there is no power or power except with God, then it is a vulnerability, so that is a gathered from the forefathers, so that, as the east said: ؎ Three in the guarantor, then it is the same A nine on the day is a irrigated day ∗∗∗ and the drinking of the woman, above the irrigation, is a disease, so it is a word that is not heard from the words of the word The frustration is on the sum of the number of numbers, and if the rulings are the rhetoric of the word (that), as we say in it, that is a full ten: The fall in the storyteller is not the memorial of that, and the same is the saying of the Farzdaq: ؎ Three and two are two, so the sixth of ∗∗∗ and the sixth of the tunnel to the sham: And the acceptance and in the face of the need to the frustration in the verse, and it is said that it is a repetition of confirmation, as you say: I wrote in my hands that it means that he came to me, that is, that he came to me, that is, that he came to me He came to an Arab style, and it is only beneficial to the ruling in the mind, two times, and for that the owner of the scouts said when he mentioned the same: as the one who said: And on the authority of Al -Mubarrad: It is a certainty to pay a delusion that the rest of it is something that his fast is obligatory, and Al -Zajaj said: He may be delusional that the one who is delusional is the one The fasting of three days in Hajj or seven days if he returns to his country in place (P-229) of the three, then I will be removed from the way of what is meant by saying: The scouts said: Waw may come to the porn in the face of your saying: The goodness of the good and Ibn Sirin, so I missed a denial of the perpetrator of the porn.He wants pornography that it is for the release that the group is permissible and does not appoint.In both words, there is a need for the origin of the origin of the illusion of the meaning of the selection, so I say: This meaning, even if it is the disagreement of the original in the waw until the grace of the son of Him, The choice is used from the form of the matter, not that it may be deluded from where God mentioned two numbers in two states of different ones, and made the least of the two to the two of the two cases To be afraid, then there is no crime that is delusional that God has fulfilled the fast of three days, and that the seventh is a summary of those who wanted to choose, so what is the good, so what is the good, so what is the good, so what is the good, so what is the goodness, so what is the goodness, so what is the goodness, so what is the good, so what is the good.Rather, the indication is that the intention of God is the adherence of the fast of ten days, but its separation is a summary and a mercy from it, so it was the same.And his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: We are three nights, and we have completed it with twenty, so the meeqaat of his Lord has fulfilled four nights [Al -A'raf: 142] when he said: Four successful nights, but it was notified of it as a texture.I had been asked about the rule of one ten days, and I answered that he may have arisen from the collection of seven and three; Because they are a number of two places, but the extension of the defense, and the wisdom of the time of the distribution was to two varying numbers, not equal, and not equal.To disagree with the status of the pilgrimage, it is hard, and the state of stability in the house.And the extension of making some fasting in the period of pilgrimage, making some worships when it is due, and the increasing of the time to three and the seven is that they are all of them.Religious and judicial works.As for the saying (complete), it will benefit the incidence of the two days of fasting, all of which are not decreased from them, with the intelligence of that fasting, and that it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same.It is used in his right and metaphor.And he said: That is for whom it is not His family is the present of the mosque.As for the angel, he did not intend to seek to restore the travel, so therefore he was not guided, and this (P-23) said the money of your money, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: They have the people of the Mecca in the Mecca in the Mecca and the Quran; Because they are not difficult for them to return the Umrah, and Abu Hanifa said: Referring to all what the previous words include in the name of the sign, which is the abuse of the The guidance, it does not see the enjoyment and the Qur’an for the people of Mecca, which is a side of the view.And the mosque is present, they are the people of the country of Mecca and what it has gave it, and it was disagreeing in defining what it has gave it, so Malik said: What was connected to the Makkah and that of those who have been Mecca.Al -Shafi’i said: Whoever was from Mecca on the distance of the palace and was attributed by Ibn Habib to Malik and his mistake is the chicken of the gold.Ata said: The mosque is present, the people of Mecca and the people of Arafa, and bitter, and a burden, and Daghnan, and Al -Rajah, and Al -Zuhiri said: It is like it, and Ibn Zaid said: Tawass said: The mosque is present, the forbidden person, who was inside the sanctuary, and Abu Hanifa said: They are those who were inside the times, whether they were angel or other than them, * * * Fear God and know that God is the hardship of punishment, and to piety after the two rulings that are not devoid of hardships, to warn of the sake of the year And the pilgrimage is from the sentence of that is from the sentence of the general, and it is the most beautiful individuals of the general, because the words are in it.And his saying: Know that God is the most punished, he was open to his saying: and know that he was tired of the news, so he did not say that it is said (and fear God).If he had been assured of it, he would have obtained the one who is required.Because science is from the news, but when I want to achieve the news, it is open to the matter of knowledge; Because it is in the sense of achieving the news, as if he says: Do not doubt that, then he stated that “if”, and a nose is presented when he said: “And God’s saying: The righteous [Al -Baqarah: 194]
