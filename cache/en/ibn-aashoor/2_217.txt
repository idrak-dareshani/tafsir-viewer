The Quranic researcher will ask you about the month of the forbidden in which there is a fight in which there are great among the most important of the consequences of the conditions in the fighting that was written on the Muslims in the verse that is what is before it.If the fighting between them and between the two famous peoples, the most famous of the deprivation, was a quarrel in the Arabs from a pledge (P-324) as an old, and Islam did not remember the heroes of that stone; Because it is from the reconciliation, the Almighty said that God made the forbidden house to stand up for people and the month of the forbidden [Al -Ma’idah: 97], so the situation was sent on the question about the one who is the one in Islam.The one narrated in the reasons for the descent from Al -Zuhri, a messenger, and Al -Tabiri narrated from the Arab ibn Al -Zubayr, a messenger and a long time, that this verse was descended in Bin Jahsh, then the Prophet ﷺ sent him in eighties of his companions, he receives an expression of Quraysh with a palm tree in the last of the last in the year of the second year The Muslims are in which a merchant from the sects and on the elder Amr ibn al -Hadrami, and a man from the Muslims killed Omar and the family of two of his companions, and the two of his companions God ibn al -Mughira and al -Hakam ibn Kaysan, and he fled from them, Nawfal ibn Abdullah ibn al -Mughira and the spoils of the Muslim are a spoil, and that is from the first day The last, so he grew up on a Quraysh and said: Muhammad was broken by the month of the forbidden, and they were filled with that, so this verse was revealed.And the two captives, and it was said: He responded the two captives and took the spoil.If it is true that this verse was removed before we were descended from the verse of which the fighting was written on you, and it is a hatred for you [Al -Baqarah: 216] and a verse and fight in the path of God.With a long period, when the two verses came down after this, they were put in recitation before it with a special loyalty, so that this verse would not be done for this verse, so that this is a good thing.The other verses, and this has a lot of verses in many verses by adopting the descent and recitation.And it appears that this verse has come down after the verse that was before it and that it is complementary and affirming the verse of the month of the forbidden month [Al -Baqarah: 194].And the question here is the question of the righteous, the one ﷺ on the day of the Hadaybiyyah, is it fighting in the month of the forbidden as it is presented at the saying of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month.This is the appropriateness for his saying here and a reply from the path of God, etc.The sentence is a premature exile, and it was answered on the question of people about the fighting in the month of the forbidden and the appropriateness of its signing, the following of the verse of which is written on you.[216] And the definition in the month of the forbidden is the definition of gender, and for that I do well to replace the denial of it in His saying: (P-325) is a fight in it, and it is a detection, so it is permissible in it during the disappearance of the definition from the knowledge, with the disagreement of the bit of some that it is the same as the denial of the denial of it.It makes it in the power of the knowledge.What is meant by the rule of the ruling of any month was one of the most famous and any of the conquests.Among the Muslims are like you, and the one who is the one who caused the question to the question is in a certain month that does not require that the question be specialized, as the question is not.The questioner, but the intended, is the question about the permanent judgment of the rule that has before them before Islam, and he does not conclude a month without a month.Rather, the choice of the way of creativity here was the necessity of the phenomenon to be said: They ask you about fighting in the month of the forbidden for the sake of the sake of the sake of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month of the one who warns it to the one Is there a fight?No, for the sake of fighting, is it falling in the month while they are dead, but the progress is to spend the right of the fulfillment, and this is a disorder to dispel the kindness of the people, in the kindness On the way to the way of the insults, a skillet, then detailing, and the denial of “fighting” intended by the general, as the one who is responsible for it is not in the right of it.But what is meant is this sex in this sex.And it has a description of a special fight for him.And he said that there is a fight in which there is a great way to keep the fighting in the place of the guests, so that the answer is clear until it is not deluded that the month of the forbidden is the great The question is in Al -Falaz, but it was not known to be the one who is the second to be given with the imams with the question of the question, because he has been used to seek to know the question of the question of the question And the answer was noted while it is a dispersal (in it), as it is not intended from the definition of the denial with the blame if its remembrance is repeated, except for the prescription that the one who wants it is not the same With the description of the unit, Al -Tafazmani said: The one who is responsible for it is the answerer of it, and it is not otherwise, as it is accused of based on the fact that the denial, if it is repeated, is the one who is repeated, if it is repeated, if it is repeated It is not a stroke of necessity that he wants to follow the readers.The answer is legitimate, if the question is from the Muslims, and a confession and acknowledgment if the question is a denial of the participants, because they signed to answer them with the pledge In his heart is ill.(P-326) The largest in the origin is the great corpse of its type, and it is a metaphor in the strong, the many, the elderly and the obscene, and it is a structured boss on its similarities, with the suspicion of the mind.The strong in its type is the great corpse in the individuals, because it is a flock in that it is strong, and it is here in the sense of the great in the sinner in the curtain of the shrine, the same Sins are great, and the news of the Prophet ﷺ “and what they are tormented in great and the great” hadith.The meaning is that the fighting in the most deprived months is a great sin, for the denial is here for the public with the reverence of the shrine, as there is no specificity for the fighting of people without one another, nor for the two people, nor for the two people Other than him, not, and the answer to the answer to the question, you have confirmed the general, because the question about him is the ruling of this gender, which is the fighting in this gender, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is I am the most part of the fighting that it is permissible is our involved fighting and with that, so he is the one who is responsible for him, and he is the one who has fallen from the embarrassment of it, but the fighting of the Muslims is not With his struggle in the month of the forbidden, and as for the fighting of the other nations, it is not dangerous at that time.The verse is a sign of the prohibition of fighting in the most deprived of the most famous and a report of the most famous of the deprivation that God has made for it since the time Peace, the forbidden time requires the blessing of the ingredient in its duration.This is the most famous of the pilgrimage and its advances and its sisters and for the life as well as if he would not be forbidden to fight through it to be disturbed by the Hajj and the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage, and for the pilgrimage, In the country of the Arabs, they are partners for the benefit of the Muslims and the extension of the pilgrimage.And the prohibition of fighting in the month is prohibited after this verse was then copied, so it is devoted to it, so it is said that it is exalted, and you will not fight them at the time In it [Al -Baqarah: 191] to the saying of the month of the forbidden month, the month of the forbidden and the forbidden is divided [Al -Baqarah: 194].As for his copying, he said, “Him, and His Messenger, to those who have pledged to those who have been entrusted to those who have been shared by the one who is the one who has been in the land.” The most deprived of the rituals, kill the partners where you found them [Repentance: 5], so it was stated in the abuse of the covenant who has pledged to the Muslims who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been the one who has been the one Reformed the Hadibiya; Because it was not a covenant that is affected by a certain time or forever, and because the participants have become their faith (P-327), as in the other verse, you will not fight them.With the exaggeration of the Messenger [Repentance: 13].Then, God Almighty has rented them for a sake of time, which is the elimination of the most deprived of that year, and it is a year of nine of migration in the Hajj of my father, with the people, because that is the one who has been The participants came out, and he said to them, and they were shouting in the earth for four months [Repentance: 2], and the last of the one who is forbidden from the year of ten of the migration, then he said, then he said, then he said, then he said, then he said, then he said, then he said, then he said: [Repentance: 5] That is, that four months, kill the participants, where you found them [Repentance: 5] So we copied the prohibition of fighting in the most deprived of the famous, Because the participants are a collection defined by the words of the spectrum, and it is one of the form of the general and the general person of the people who is obligated by the generalities of the Azniyah and the one who is able to verify the The month of Al -Qaddah is a hoop, so he opened Mecca as it is in the books of the correctness.Aba Amir was invaded to a whims in the month of the forbidden, and the Muslims were collected on the invasion of the invasion in all the months of the Sunnah, they invade the people From the partners.If you say: If it is copied, the fighting is dirty in the most deprived of the famous, so what is the meaning of the saying of the Prophet ﷺ in the speech of the Hajj of the Hemorrhoid Your day is in your month in your country, "because the suspicion requires the reports of the prohibition of the most famous.I said: If the fighting is prohibited in it, it is a follower to glorify it, its prohibition, and its eagerness from the fall of the parties and the grievances in it, so the crime is in it, it is more than the greatest of it.And the oppression is forbidden at all times, and the fight for the sake of the truth is worshiper, so we are dirty, the prohibition of fighting in it is for that, and the remainder of the famous is the same.It is better than this that the verse has decided the prohibition of fighting in the most deprived months of the ruling of the faith of the paths of Hajj and Umrah, as the life is more in the righteous, and there is a ritual that is in the righteous, and he said: And he dominated that until the Prophet ﷺ the pilgrimage to the participants in the year of the Hajj of Abu Bakr on people; As the Mecca has become in the hand of the Muslims and entered Islam, Quraysh and the great doors of the Arabs and the rest are prevented from the vision of Mecca, and that this was the necessity The most famous Because it is forbidden in it for the sake of the two ways of the pilgrimage and life.This has been disrupted by the lineage for the participants, and the pilgrimage remained only for the Muslims, and they are not fighting between them, as the oppression is forbidden in every time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time.He did not occupy a concern like Hajj, so his name (P-328) is a copy of forgiveness, but it is the end of the referee, and the same is the same in the name The one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is pre -emptive is before the Hajj, With the prohibition of fighting in the most deprived of the most famous, as there is no point in the pilgrimage.The meaning of the copying of the prohibition of fighting in the most deprived of the famous is that the pilgrim to it has passed as it ended as the bank’s behavior ended with the expense of the zakat.* * * And he replied from the path of God, disbelief in Him, the mosque, the forbidden, and the delay of his family from him is greater than God and the girl is greater than the killing of the one who is the one.After that they grabbed them with a report of the deprivation of the deprivation indicating that what was signed from the family The month or the rituals of the deprivation of the lineage of the fighting of the enemy, for the entrepreneurs, they are glorified and developed, and they are disappointed while they come to what is more than that of it The forbidden is not for the souls of the most famous, because the time is not forbidden in itself in itself, but it is forbidden to make God, which is forbidden, so it is forbidden.The prohibition of the most deprived of the consequences of the insurance of the path of pilgrimage and Umrah and their presents and their concerns in it, so do not go that those who have the exaltation of the exaltation are in the way Self -prohibitions in the way of the Muslims, and disbelieve in God, who made the Kaaba a forbidden and forbidden for the sake of the most famous pilgrimage, and they went out, and the people of the people, With the adherents and the slander, because the things that are mentioned all are prohibited for themselves, they are not followed by others.Al -Hasan said the Basriya of a man from the people of Iraq, he asked him about the blood of mosquitoes if he hit the garment, will he be imprisoned, and that was the punishment of the one who kills the one who kills the good About them: Wonder to you, O people of Iraq The representation here is entitled to the saying of Al-Farzdaq: ؎ I get angry, if we are permanently groaning, and you did not get angry to kill Ibn Khazim (P-329) (P-329) It is one of the verbal actions of the two parties with the sin of the sin in the month of the forbidden.And the one in his saying of God with a metaphor of metaphor, and it is the science of knowledge and judgment.And the precedence in its saying is the greatest compulsion of the richness, that is, every one of those masculinity is greater.What is meant by the echo of the path of God is: from those who want Islam from him and his counterpart, his saying is exalted, you promise and repent from the path of God who believed in [86].And the infidelity of God: the partner of it with the proportions of the two participants, and they are the most Arabs, and also the denials of its presence in the lineage of the two of them, and the one who is in the authority of the words of the words His Excellency said that those who disbelieved themselves with them [Al -Baqarah: 6] etc.And his saying in it is in it for the transgression of “disbelief” and it is not for the kindness and the guarantee that is bound by the bacterium, which is domesticated to the name of the majesty.And disbelief is given to an eternity, that is: a reply from the path of God and a disbelief in God is greater than the fighting of the month of the forbidden, even if the fighting is great.And the mosque is the one who is given to the path of God.And know that the appearance of the phenomenon of the arrangement of the word of words is said: It is a replacement of the path of God, an infidel of it, and a reply from the mosque, the forbidden, and the people of his family, from his family, This system is required to the image that the verse came to, that his saying was presented and disbelieved in it, so he would be made of a shift before he is a replacement.And the mosque is the forbidden It is a kind of one who is attached The one who is attached to the one who is attached to him is a foreigner about the one who is given to him, and the one who is given to the comment is from the prayer of the one who is given to him, and the preacher is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one On the most accurate levels than the necessity of the phenomenon, which is the fulfillment of the presentation of what is more than their wives, then the disbelief in God is more than the one who is the one The organizer is the most important and the most important, for that the replacement of the path of Islam collects a lot The Messenger of God, and the conversation with them, their identity for their idols, make God a single God (P-330).Islam, so the reply came from the path of God, then he praised the disbelief with God, so that he can benefit from the custody of the abstain They have to replace them with the mosque, and then his family was released from him.It is not correct that the mosque is the righteousness of the guilt in his saying about it, because there is no meaning for disbelief in the mosque, the forbidden, for the disbelief is what is the disbeliever They are included in a debt, that they glorify the mosque, the forbidden, and they do not accommodate in it what is justified to be charged with release of the disbelief on the face of the face.And his saying and the delay of his family from him, that is, the lament of Muslims from Mecca, so they were around the mosque, because in their exhaustion, there is a lot In their circumstances to the city, and many of them have been afflicted by the fever until it was raised from the city with the blessing of the supplication of the Messenger ﷺ, that the preference is that it is suspended The most deprived, not by the same murder, for he has a judgment that specializes.And the people: the parties with whom the more is added to what is added to the memorizers, so among the people of the man is his tenth With it, and he wanted it here, the one who is the one who is the Muslim, and they are the Muslims, and there is a gesture that they have the right to the mosque, because they are the ones who followed the one who followed the one who followed He said: And what were their guardians, that the first of the righteous (Al -Anfal: 34).And his saying and the temptation are greater than the killing, a marketer, the argument of the explanation, for its saying and the delay of its people from it; And if the people of the sanctuary were lagging more than the killing; What was mentioned before the dislocation of religion and the disbelief in God and the replacement of the mosque is the greatest of the sake Mecca.And the temptation: operation and rhythm in confusion, and the necessity of living, it is a comprehensive name for what is exaggerated from the harmful harm on one or a group of others, and I want it to what it is.One of the partners is one of the injustice in religion by exposing them to harm by saying and verb, and their prevention of the emergence of their worshipers, and their category, in the way And the damaged and the fill in killing the Messenger ﷺ and the launch of the Mecca and the prevention of their mothers and their women and their repulsion from the house, and it is not hidden from the one who is the same One of the Muslims is one of the people of the participating, who is the age of Al -Hadrami, and their families are two men.(P-331) The greatest is more powerful, i.E.Power in the incest, that is, greater than the killing that is in the month of the forbidden.* * * They are still fighting you until they want you from your religion, if they are able to be a senior sentence, which is called to the symptoms of it, the appropriateness The breasts of the temptation are among the Muslims and what the temptation is included in the fighting that the Muslims turned and the participants.As the fighting is included in the types of harm, and the killing is only some of the conditions of the fighting not to see it to say it to the ears of those who are fighting that they are wronged [Hajj: 39] The Muslims are a fighter and called the Muslims who fought with the opening of the vit.After the migration; Because they were measured by the effects of my age, so they said it is still, and if I feel that their fighting is obligatory, then what is meant by the reasons for the fighting, which is harm and the guarantee of the fighting, as well They are cut off from it, that the sworn is “the indication is that this lasts in the future, and“ even ”is for the cancellation, and it is an endless end.The meaning: that their fascination and their fighting lasts until they get their abuse, which is to return you from your religion.And his saying that they are able to inflict it that they do not seek the response of the Muslims from their religion, so the location of this condition is the fall of the entry of the head of the His saying until you want you from your religion, and this is the condition with a letter.And the response: The way of something and the return to what was before that, so it exceeds the verb with itself and to what increased the verb to the one and the one who is omitted Related to the mediation of “to“ to show that they fight them to return them from Islam to the evil that they were on, because the people of every religion if they believe in the right of the religion The entry of the people in it said: The highest said, and you will not be satisfied with you, nor the Christians, until you follow their mill [Al -Baqarah: 120], and he said, “If you disbelieve, as they disbelieve [89].And the condition of the condition The significance is that their depletion is that, and if there are Muslims, they are a matter that is excluded by the power of the faith of the Muslims, so the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The Muslims are false.* * * (P-332) And whoever recovers from you from his religion is dead while he is an infidel, then those who have been seen in the world and the hereafter, and those are the people of the fire, they are in it On the syntax before it, and the intended it is warning, because when the partners were kept kept in the response That is one of the Muslims, followed by warning about it, and coming with a form of repetition and it is a folded formula, indicating that their return from Islam is that it is not possible Among the participants, whoever tasted the sweetness of faith is not easy for him to return from him and whoever knows the truth does not return from him except with a curse, and he did not notice the second.As I do not reflect on the debt that is promised to it, but rather the judgment of the ruling on the abuse of Islam to any religion and from the day the name of the response has become a nickname for the sake of the grace of the authority of the grace of the In this conclusion, there is a return to a debt that this outside was.And he said it, and it is a matter of kindness on the condition, and it is a second condition.And the verb “lounging” from the door of hearing and transgressing with the prodigy, the linguists said: Its origin is from the lumping with the opening of the B is, and it is a swelling in the camels of the camel from the largest of the greatness, Its release of the acts of acts; Because the camels eat the vegetables as a lust for the sacrifice, and it will be upon it with the death, so the state of those who did the righteous work would like to benefit them in the last, so he did not.She ate until she was stained, and that was not restricted by the work with glows to appear that representation.And the waters of the works: the disappearance of its effects is the arrangement of a law, so its effects are included in the world and the reward in the hereafter, and it is the secret of its saying in the world and the last.The effects in the world are what arises from Islam from the properties of the Muslims, the first of which is the effects of the word of martyrdom from the sanctity of the soul, the money, the symptoms, the prayer, the prayer, the prayer, the prayer, the symptoms, and the prayer of the soul, and the symptoms, and the prayer, and the prayer is upon him The Muslims of the Muslims.And the effects of worship and the virtue of Muslims in the abandonment and the brotherhood between the migrants, the supporters, the Islam and the effects of rights like the right of the Muslim in the mind of the money and the money Inheritors and marriage, states and equality, and what God has guaranteed to the Muslims, like his saying, whoever has done good from male or female, and he is a believer, so let him be a believer, so let us be a believer..(P-333) As for the effects in the hereafter, it is the survival of the fire in the cause of Islam and what is arranged on the righteous.What is meant by the construction: In the original of the material and the place of warning; Because if the blasphemy was overwhelmed, the words would be burned, and the work was mentioned in the Qur’an with the domination of only the rest of the righteousness.And his saying, and those who are the people of the fire, are in it, and they are kind to the sentence of the penalty on the infidels, as the things are with its seeds, so it was repeated on the disbelief: Salafa, and the punishment of the immortality in the fire, and the formation of the immortality is a punishment that is the restoration of the name of the sign in its saying and those who are the people of the fire.And in the name of the sign in the two alerts, they are hated by what was mentioned after the name of the sign for the sake of what was mentioned before the name of the sign.This has arranged the lifting of the works on the group of two things that are more and the death on the infidels, and the excess of the death did not restrict it to the death of it, and whoever is in the words His work was loaded while he was in the last one of the losers [Al -Ma’idah: 5] and his saying is the Almighty, while you are partner, and your work will be loved, and you will be among the losers [Al -Zumar: 65] They were overwhelmed by what they were doing [Al -Anam: 88] and the scholars have disagreed with the people who were from Islam if he repented from his response and returned to Islam, so he has a money and my father is from my father The Muslims, then he returned to Islam and repented, did not return to him his works that he did before the increase He returned to Islam, and if he had Hajj before he was wounded, then he returned to Islam, he rented the pilgrimage, and it is not taken from what was on the time of the excess, except for what he did.Al -Shafi’i said: If the one returns to Islam, all of which are returned to him, what he has and what he has.As for the pilgrimage of Malik, Ibn Al -Arabi said: Our scholars said: But God mentioned the condition of this, because he was suspended in the fire on the fire, so whoever is in the fire is upon him, so whoever is in the fire is upon him, so whoever is in the fire is upon him In this verse: And whoever shares (P-334), his work is overwhelmed with the other verse, so they are two beneficial verses of two meanings and two wiped people.He wants that between the two parties and the two answers here is a time, so he said it: Those are the ones whose work was seen in the world and the hereafter is a answer to the saying of it.And his saying: And those who are the people of the fire are in it, they are an answer to his saying: He is dead while he is a disbeliever, and perhaps in a return (and those) to mark that it is a second answer, and in the first answer Perception of the death on the infidels is a verse on the purpose of this meaning of this restriction in this verse.And in this recitation of the cancellation of the boundary of the boundary, and perhaps we look at your money in abolishing that, that these judgments are returned to the basis of the religion With the false evidence, if the absolute evidence is carried on the restriction of the budget The project is because it is a thoughtful indication, and most of the evidences are a thought, but in the origins of the belief, it was taken from every clear verse, and it is in this way.Some of the reminders of the bones returned to the Islamist and its branch like the pilgrimage.The argument for the advisor is the bonds of the boundary, as the pride mentioned it and the son of the horse was corrected from the money.If you say: The righteous deed in the ignorance is determined by Islam.About Islam is less immediate than the people of the ignorance.The answer is that the ignorance of the ignorance before the coming of Islam is the case of an evacuation from the law, so it was a virtue of Islam.This is a dispute in the meeting of the ruling of the companion for those who wanted after the Prophet ﷺ Then they returned to Islam like the village of Bin Habir Three, Al -Ash'ath ibn Qais, Ayoun ibn Hasan, and Amr ibn Ma’adi Karb, and in the explanation of the judge Zakariya on the al -Awqi al -Araqi: and in the Muslim, then he wore, then he became Muslim after the death of the Messenger in the companions, a great look.Halalu said in the explanation of the collection of the pipes: If the companions would be worsened in the life of the Messenger ﷺ and returned to faith after his death, that was running on the dispute in the response, whether it is the same Its fall or it is lined with the condition of the death on it, because the companion of the Messenger ﷺ is a great virtue, but the acceptance of his narrators, after his opinion, after the forefront of it (P-335) If you say: What is the secret in the abundance of these two conditions in this verse with the rest of the rest of it, we are notary of the two of the two conditions, I said: that is the one who came to the other.Participation on the satisfaction of its fall from otherwise, as in a verse and whoever disbelieves in faith [Al -Ma’idah: 5] or its struggle with whom he is in the way of it, and its sins from it, as well It was not for them to do what they were doing [Al -Anam: 88]) The loss is with an extent, but this verse has been returned to the commemorative remembrance of the entrepreneurs and their reasons for the Muslims who are addressed to the two who are addressed to the two who are the ones who addressed.The polytheism and the increase of them are close, because of the infection of the partners, that is to the seizures of the Muslims, so he reminded in it the increase in Tahuil, which is the immortality in the fire.And this verse was from the evidence of the prophecy, as it was located in the year of the response, that those who remained in their hearts were the effect of the evil, they were tried from the Muslims who are more than that Great and the friend rose May God be pleased with him with his intention and protect him, and he will fight them, so he returned from them who remained alive, and if this verse had not been made, they would not be from the abandonment of the return to Islam.The compassion has indicated in his saying, and he died with the beneficial fulfillment of the punishment that the death follows the increase and the knowledge of every one has known that the greatest of the one who is the one The increase, so the smile knows, then that the apostate is punished by the dead, a legitimate, so that the verse will be a sign of it on the authority of the one who kills the one who kills the one who kills the one who kills the one who kills the one who kills the The scholars of the nation, and the Jamour said: The steadfastness is followed three days and it is imprisoned for that, so if it repented, it will be accepted.Al -Kha into Al -Khattab and Uthman bin Afan and with him said Malik and Ahmad ibn Hanbul and Ishaq ibn Rahayah, whether he was a man or a woman, and Abu Hanifa said in the man in the man And the killing of the threshold did not see, but he said that it is divided, and his companions said that he is loved until they were greeted, and Abu Musa Al -Ash'ari said, and Mu’az bin Jabal, Jubays, and the son of the son of the son Al -Aziz ibn Al -Majshun and Al -Shafi’i by killing the stretching and not being followed, and it was said that a month and the pretext of all the hadith of Ibn Abbas “whoever replaces his religion and kills his religion.” Abu Bakr al -Bakr al -Mursenin murdened, and burned the rackets who claimed to be on me, and gathered on the authority that the intention of the hadith is: Islam, and the gathering agreed that “who” (P-336) is a whole for the male and the female except for those who were distracted from them and he is the father of Hanifa and Ibn Shabarmah, Al-Tuari, Ata, and Al-Hasan: Al -Mu'tamidah and begged by the Messenger of God ﷺ on the killing of women, and they were allocated to him, “Whoever changes his religion”, and he is a wondrous argument, because this is the rulings of this And the woman from its matter is not to fight, for it is also forbidden to kill the dread and the albums.Malik and Abu Hanifa have tightened in the stretching with the sobright, i.E.The purification of Islam and the infidelity of the infidels, and they said: He is killed and his repentance is not accepted if he is taken before.And whoever curses the Prophet ﷺ was killed and his repentance is not accepted.This is, and know that the narration in the origin is the exit of the bond of Islam when the Muslims were crowded; And the exit of the holy and the leaving the aspirations of Islam at the Kharijites and some of the disgraced, who say the disbelief of the greatness With its declaration, a text or a guarantee, the text is back, and the guarantee is that one comes with memorization or verb that will be included in that, and it is not the same The Muslims are collected that he only releases a disbeliever like prostration of the entity, And hesitation to the people in the case of the people of her religion.And they attached to that denial of what was known as the one who came to the Messenger of the Messenger, that is, what was knowledgeable about it is a harmful person.And in the discourse of his realism, it is a view of the jurisprudence, the books of jurisprudence and the dispute.And the ruling on the legitimacy of the killing of the rose with the fact that the infidel is not killed that the increase is the exit of a group or a group of the Islamic university, so it is with the goodness In it, it is called that when this religion is the one who found it, it is not good and found what was before it before that reconciled, so this is an abandonment of the debt, and it is a delegation, Whoever wants to be forgotten from this religion, and that leads to the dissolution of the college, if he would not make this mower, the people have not been improved, and we did not find anything like that The death, so the death was made is the wise for the warden until no one enters religion except in insight, and until no one comes out of it after the entry I will be in the religion that is exaggerated by the Almighty saying (P-337), I do not deny it in the debt [Al-Baqarah: 256] on the saying that it is not a texture, because his dedication in the debt is the one who is dedicated to the religion of the people.And the income in Islam, and this is from its eclipse of survival in Islam.
