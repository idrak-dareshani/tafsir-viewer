The researcher of the Quran, where you came out, and your face, the waters of the mosque, the forbidden, and it is the right of your Lord, and what God is unaware of what you do, and from where you have come out, then you will come out.And where you were, and their faces, so that it would not have a pilgrimage to you, except for those who have been wronged, so do not fear them and fear me, for you and for you, and let me be blessed with you You are guided by his saying, and from where you have come out of his saying, and your face is the dominance of the mosque.The Kaaba in the present prayer does not go to doing it, even if in the case of excuse is like a travel.The hardships in the calamity of the kaaba, maybe a delusional understanding of the rituals of it, and in the greatest of this verse with the words of it, and it is the saying of it He is fulfilled by the matter of kissing, and his saying is confirmed in the preceding verse of the right from your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 147].And his saying, and what God is unaware of what you do the increase in warning against the eolescence in the matter of kissing.And he said after him and from where she was brought up to the sentence before him, and he was returned to the words of the righteous sentence to build upon him to say to him.You have an argument.And he said it, and where you were, and they were your faces, and his affliction is kind to his saying, and from where the verse was out of the verse.And the intended intention in this judgment in the travel of Muslims, so that it is not delusional to the prophet ﷺ.And he obtained the greatness of the great words of the ruling, so that his saying should be repeated, so that people will not be for you a pilgrimage.The matter was disturbed by receiving the news, the Kaaba, three times, and the matter was repeated by receiving the Muslims, the Kaaba two times.And he was repeated that the truth is three times, and the baptism of the flaws is repeated three times, and the intention of all of that is the intelligence of the righteousness of the calamity of the ritual of the calamity and the calamity That is a report of the right to the souls of the Muslims, and a increase in the response to the denial of confirmation, from the increase and from where it was out of it, and from the sentences of the supplicant With the ruling of the ritual: It is a sentence, and those who have given the book to know [Al -Baqarah: 144] The verses, and a sentence, and it is for the right of your Lord and a sentence that is not for you to be for you The defamation of the right of the kaaba with that, because the one who is the right is not increased by the denials of the denials, except for the silence.Because the return indicates investigation in the sense of speech.It was mentioned in this way from the Bayan of this manner of this manifestation and what he has paid for it, what is driven by a little bit God With a heavy etc., and he mentioned his saying, so that people would not be for people, etc.(P-46) The guarantee is in and it is the right of your Lord to return to the sentences of the sentence, and it is the ruling of the manifestation.We gave them the book, they know it [Al -Baqarah: 146] and the public read what you do with a certainty and remaining on the discourse, and Abu Omar read it.And his saying, so that there will be no argument for you to say that they will be the same as the request of the verb and its compliance, that is, I will see you for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you.And it is the reason for the form of the student that the reason for the request be to adopt the adoption of the required actual act.The manifestation of the form of the student is to find the verb or the leaving, not the media, as the student is a student, otherwise the compliance is required for the commander, so he will be satisfied with the hearing of the good.Investment.And the definition in the “people” of the darkening includes the partnership of Mecca, for it is that they are liked to say: We do not follow this religion, as it is not a boredom that is a mourning Before the Jews and the Christians, the people of the book, and the argument to say: Muhammad, fight us and receive before us, so how they invite us to follow it.And for all people, who are your promise to you, that is, for this religion to be contrary to the future of every religion that precedes it, so the people of the religion are not claimed.There is no doubt that the appearance of the receipt is in a matter of view for every one because the perception of the violation in the rulings and the legitimate intentions and the premiums are not preferred by the one who is the best of it.Everyone knows that it is only known to those who have known knowledge, and on this, he will be his saying, so that people will not be for you, and the argument of those who look at you, and those who say to you, and those who say to you.The book is to know that the truth [Al -Baqarah: 144], and the saying of those who came to the book they know it [Al -Baqarah: 146].It was said in the sense of the argument of people, with other cane, which I see beyond.And the argument in the words of the Arabs is what is meant by the proof of the violator, in which he does not find it in detail, and for that it is said to the one who defeated him with his pilgrimage: The needy is what he thinks of a pilgrimage and if he is a jungle, he said: He was taken, it is said: Haji if he comes with what he thinks of his argument, he said: “Do you not see to the one who is a pilgrim,” A fact is called only on the proof and the exaggerated signs of the violator, and its release on the suspicion is a perfume because it is used in the image of the argument They were performed (P-47) is a flood with their Lord [Al-Shura: 16], and this is the language of the language as he referred to the scouts, and as for the words of some of the people of the language of the language Al -Haqqi and Al -Mujezi, but they wanted to detail from the roses of the discretion and form On the authority of them, because the condemnation is the rule of it by providing the judgment of the triumph from it by the whole of the people of the tongue and the scholars, but there is no disagreement The origins, so this discretion became that those who wronged them have an argument, and the owner of the scout answered you, that he was released for him to his argument In their legs, the proof of the proof, that is, the discretion of those who wronged it, requires that they come with a pilgrimage, that is, with what the Hajj is likened to, and he is a warning, but it is not.A prejudice used in the metaphorical meaning, and the release of the memorizers in its true and metaphorical meaning is not a creator, not with the two words that he is not.The discretion is interrupted in the sense: but those who wronged you are listening to you, so do not fear them.And a sentence, and for my blessing, and a second prayer for his saying, and their faces are given to him, and he will be given to him It is a nose, which is that it is complied with compliance.It was built for God Almighty, and it is known that the rise of the blessing by compliance with what we commanded it, and the whole of that is the ruling and the entry of paradise.That is, the end of the rhythm is the entry of paradise, and that was not in the interpretation of this verse, but it is from the sentence of its own Not to complete it after it was incomplete, for it is a closeness of his saying, so he came to them, that is, they are completely complied with them, and it is not intended to do so, then he did, then do so, then he did, then do so, then he did, then do so, then he did, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do so, then do it, then do it, then do it, then do it.And to be a blessing in every case.And his saying, and perhaps you will be guided by kindness, and to fulfill any of you with that, the hope of your compliance, so that the deduction of you will get the right.And the “perhaps” of his saying, and perhaps you will guide a metaphor in the necessary meaning of hope, and it is the proximity of that and its closure.And the meaning of making this closeness is that they will be acquired by the Kaaba, who is authorized that they are accustomed to (P-48), whose things are their things, because the principles are on the authority As his saying, and so we made you a nation and a simple nation [Al -Baqarah: 143] as we came to him and Habib said: “If the crescent, if you see its growth, you will be able to fully fully.
