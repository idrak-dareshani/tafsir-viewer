The Quranic researcher has a partner, so let them come to their parts, if they were honest (P-96) (Umm), a third transitional is a third of the conversion We are given the same as what the Muslims are given or the best of what they give, which is to be supposed to be that their idols support them and make them a luck from the reward of the good.The meaning: Rather, you will be proven to them, that is, for their sake and their benefit, any partnerships for us in the divine in their claim, so he deleted it (to be stuck) When they became a partner in the dome of the title, that is, the mother of God for them, so let them bring them to benefit them on the Day of Resurrection.And the blame is in (they) for the lame, that is, for them with added estimated estimation, that is, for the sake of their victory, the blame is like the blame in the saying of Abu Sufyan on the day of the day of God..And it is a disgrace (partners) in the matter of the interrogation that is used in denial, it is beneficial to be one of the partners, that is, the idols are for them, that is, to benefit them, so they are in the place of all the idols Participated in its worshipers between the doves, and the one who is devoted to some doves.We have transferred the words of the speech from the speech to the absence of the appropriateness of its fall after (they asked them, whichever is a leader [Al -Qalam: 40]); Because the people are more important to the definition of this vulnerability, it is the prophet ﷺ and that is followed by the followers of this invalidation to them with the way of being broken.And the separation in its saying, so let them come to their parts, separately, to deny them to benefit them.And the addition of (partners) to their guarantee in its saying (let them come with their parts) to invalidate the shower of the blessing in the divine from them, that is, they are not in the divine These are the divine, the truth does not be proportional to the lineage to a group or a tribe.And like this release is a lot in the Qur’an, and it is saying it, say, claim your partners, then you are uniders, so do not see [Al -A'raf: 195].
