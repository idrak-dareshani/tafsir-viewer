The Qur'anic researcher is a running eye, a third adjective for paradise.What is meant by the soul of the eyes is like the Almighty saying: I knew the same as what I brought to [Al -Takwir: 14], meaning: the soul taught, and this is a description of the paradise in the past.Or you have a paradise of palm trees and grapes, so the ritualization will be separated through it.[Al -Israa: 91].Rather, it was not overlooked by the sentence before it for their interference by the actual actual in the first and the heavens in the second, and that is the difference from the improved of the good of the Single [Al -Ghashiyyah: 11], which is intended to be removed from the disclosure and a sentence in which there is a neighbor, which is intended to prove some of its merits.
