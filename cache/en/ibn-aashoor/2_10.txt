The Quranic researcher, their hearts are sick, and God increased them, and they have a painful torment of what they were lying in terms of incitement to the time of their equality, and it is permissible for me to be.An arrogant arrogant from the hearing of the conditions that they described before in his words, the Almighty: they deceive God and those who believe and what they deceive, except for themselves He hears that a sect that deceives God is the Almighty and deceives the people of many and reassures that its deception is walking on them, then you do not feel that it is a good He admires her arrogant command and wonder how this is dangerous with her domains.Fan.(P-279) And this is the custodian, while in their hearts, they were given to the imitator because the hearts are the place of thought in the deception, so when the questioner was about it, he was attached to it and he was attached The answer.And she dedicates a disease to exalt.And the hearts are called here to the place of thinking, as it was presented with the saying of the Almighty, the seal of God for their hearts [Al -Baqarah: 7] and the sick is a right of the right The accustomed for the vice of that body is completely completely and in the capacity of the conclusions, the pain is tired, so if the exit is completed, then it is dead.It is a metaphor in the symptoms that are exhibited for the human ethics, which comes out of its fullness, and the release of the disease on this is very popular in the words of the Arabs.To remove this symptom and his return to his accustomed is the true and metaphor, as well as the relationship of Ibn Abda al -Mulqab al -Muqaba: An expert in the medication of the women, so he mentioned the medicines and medicine for the corruption and their prayers.What is meant by the illness in his verse is the meaning of the metaphor, not referral because it is the one who was described by the hypocrites, and it is the intention of their affiliation and the two people of the people.And the meaning of God increased them is the satisfaction that that is the manifestation of the rising from the hypocrisy and the mandate of it, it was a constraint of them in the end of the days, because of the time She could be increased by increasing the days until she becomes ups, as Al -Mualtab Al -Qura’i said: The boy is for the good, as soon as he saw it ∗∗∗ Likewise, the saying in evil, and that was said: Whoever does not dream about the young is not dreaming in the oldest, and the napstels said: ∗∗∗ If you grow up or a young man, but the hypocrisy is obligatory for the increases of what it compares to the eagle of the ethical because the hypocrisy is the disturbance of the sacrifice, so they will be the one And the educated and the guided, and that is inherently inherently and the children are not limited, so the hypocrisy is in its deadness.The disease is his disease from the doctor, and you are in the way that arises from the hypocrisy from the moral diseases in the newly mentioned newly Taken in this grandfather.(P-280) (P-281) Know that this is a class that arises from hypocrisy or compares it from where he is nor the hypocrisy in religion.The hypocrisy is eliminated by three qualities: the lying of the saying, and the actual lie, which is deception, and compares that fear because the liar and the deception is that The emergence of his realism, and that is only for harmful fear or the fear of the failure of my pursuit, both of whom are authorized by the few courage, steadfastness, steadfastness, Then, every one of its thirteenth characteristic is the one who is foolish, it confirms the other things, so the liar arises from something of his stomach, because the liar is a liab People, and this is a few intelligence, because the prophet knows that people are like him and a good way of it, then his stomach leads to ignorance of the truths and the paths of the mind, and the minds of the mind His companion with the burning truths and his suspicion with him with the length of the embarrassment in that until he may have met what he created and shed, The opinion and the art in the mind, and the scholars of the ethical and the medicine have become a liar from the diseases of the brain.As for the emergence of the wonder, vanity, infidels, and corruption of opinion about the stupidity, ignorance and shedding, it is a show, and the emergence of the isolation, the coward, the coward, the coward, the coward, the coward, the coward, the coward, the coffee, and the sake The enmity of the people about deception, because the enmity of the faded starts from their feelings with his deception, and the enmity of the companions is followed by the fact that if they see that you see that Inside them, the doubt is that his salvation, which appears to them, is from the deception, so if the enmity of the two parties gets the people, all of them will be confronted with it, The perpetrator of them and corruption is to reach its perpetrator, so the people threw it from one sitting, and it was one of that to become a mockery of the people all.You have seen that the appeal about the disease of hypocrisy and the increase in it is the increase of that appeal, that is, its originality, its ability, and the generation of the other slander, and the one who is in the authority of it The two people, I feel this, for the first denial of the signal to a variety or a multiplication, and the second denial to indicate that the increased is another disease on the rest of the ritual.Rather, the increase in the disease of their hearts was attributed to God Almighty with the fact that the increase in his hearts of hearts of themselves is that God is exalted when he created this and was the one who was over.The people alerted the danger of the embarrass The denunciation, and that it is more than that of these intentions, possibly (P-282) of the heart, so it is difficult or it is excused for the impeding it after the time, and it is not possible.To his name, the Almighty is that God Almighty is angry with them, so he neglected them and their affairs, and they did not turn them out with his kindness, who awakens them from their misfortunes, to whom he is not.And that it is difficult to take off its companions from it, so that they will be warned against their treatment.The sentence of God increased them with a experienced experience of his saying in their hearts, a disease and a satellite that is signed for the abundance of the coffin, in the way, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside the bond, inside the bid, inside the bid, inside the bid, inside the bond, inside the bond, inside the bond, within the definition of the one who is in the way, inside, That the reason for their disturbance in corruption and their infection is what is not attained because in their hearts is a disease, and because it is a disease that increases with the days, it is a good way His shame.And some of the interpreters said: It is a supplication to them, as the saying of Jabir ibn al -Dabat: The interpretation is not good, because it is the disagreement of the origin in kindness with fulfillment, and because the Qur’an is confronted for their insults with that, it is not from his heart, and for the sake of God He pledged to supplication for those who are lost in the guidance of "O God, the guidance of my people, so they do not know." And his saying, and a loud torment of what they were lying to the kindness of his saying, and God increased them with a disease, as a disease The corruption of the situation in the world and the torment in the hereafter.And the progress of the neighbor and the boundary, and it is the same for his alarm that it is a news that we do not have until it is decided that the beginning of the beginning of the beginning is that the knowledge is from that of the righteousness Glam.The elder is effective in the sense of effective, because the most in this form is that Al -Ruba’i in the sense of effective and its origin is a sufficient torment in the form of the name of the name On the way of the mental metaphor, because the one who is the one who is tormented without the torment as they said his grandfather, or he is an effective in the sense of an actor from the meaning of my mother, and that is the same An active, that is, a painful woman who broken the mother, so he did not prove the Arabs in this material and fixed in its counterpart the like of the wise and the hearing with the meaning of the meaning Bin Ma’ad is raised: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ Preventing the measurement of it for the birth of the birth of it, the one who is in the violation of the violation of the measurement with a reason, so that the state of the ignorance does not confuse the case, so there is no prohibition of the words.(P-283) And he said what they were lying to the cause and read the fans (lying) by ensuring its first and tightening the worse.Asim, Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i read it, and a successor.His first and relieve the humiliation, that is, by their misfortune, the Messenger and his people are sent by God, and that the Qur’an is in the life of God to the Messenger, so the exalted of the Like the enemies and prejudice, and the readings of lightness, on their own lies in their saying, believe in God, and on their lies in the public in their saying, but we say: Reconciliation, so what is meant is lied to the defamation of faith and in making themselves the reconciliation without the believers.And the lies against the truth, and it will come with his saying, but those who disbelieve will fascinate God, the lie [Al -Ma’idah: 103] in Surah Al -Mawdidah.And (what) is the process with the breasts of the source, and the source is the lineage of any of the universe.
