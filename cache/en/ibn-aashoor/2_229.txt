The divorced Quranic researcher is two times, and they are held with a well -being or a relaxing with kindness of the male of the absence And when they are right in their return, if they wanted to pray [Al -Baqarah: 228], and about some of what is indicated to him, his saying is the Almighty and the men are upon them.For the sake of the right, as the right of the men, and made the men an increased cortex: from it that they have the right to divorce, and they have the right to return to his saying and his words [Al -Baqarah: 228] And when the matter of the Arabs in the ignorance was running over the number of the end of the divorce, as it will come as a relative, it will be reminded of the punishment of all of that.In a statement of project in this section, he was driven by what he might be stuck or commented on and in accordance with it.Malik narrated in the gathering of divorce from the slowdown: on the authority of Hesham ibn Urwah from his father that he said: The man was if he divorced his wife, then he would have come to her before that He divorced her with a thousand times, and a man baptized to his wife, so he divorced her, even if you know that she was spent.The divorce is two times, so they hold a well -being or a relaxation with charity, so the people received the divorce very new from the day of those who were divorced from them or did not divorce.(P-404) And Abu Dawood narrated, and the women narrated from Ibn Abbas, close to him.Al -Hakam narrated it in his reinforcement to the Arab ibn al -Zubayr on the authority of Aisha, and she said: It was not for the divorce a time when the man will be divorced, then he did not return it, then he did not return it, then he did not return it.A man from the supporters and among his family, some of what is among the people, and he said: And God does not leave you, neither any nor or with a husband, so he will make it divorced even if it is a matter So he did so, so God Almighty has revealed two times, and there are many narratives that are close to this, and in the Sunnah of Abi Dawood: the chapter of the dirt of the rename is the three.And the hadith of Ibn Abbas came out that if a man was divorced, then he was the right of her return, and if he divorced her three, then he will be copied and the divorce came down.The verse on this is the heroes of what the people of the ignorance have, and the definite of the rights of the struggle in the bull.And the definition in its saying is the divorce of the purpose of the sitting, according to what is replaced by the issuance of the sources, and in the legislation of the legislation, the legislation intends to the right of the truth, We say his saying, and God is the best of selling [Al -Baqarah: 275] and his saying, even if they are determined to divorce [Al -Baqarah: 227], and this definition is the one who indicated the owner of the scouts to the choice The return, who preceded the speech on it, is a nose in his saying and their dependence is the right to their cold in that [Al -Baqarah: 228], then it is the original divorce, In the origin of the project, a clear, unable to the same rejected, except for the divorce of the third, after the precedent of two before it before it, then it is not.The clear divorce that is stable with the Sunnah, so it is clear to the right of a knowledgeable, such as the right of the wife, as it gives it from its money in the immorality, and the same is the right of the Shari’a in To think of the abandonment of the good of the pamphlets, then we have been informed, and the same is the right of women to judge the ruler of it by divorce, to harm it, and delete it, for the sake of the ritual.He has to be able to estimate: the reactionary divorce is two times.He was told about the divorce that he was two times, so he knew that the estimation: the right of the husband to the rhythm of the launch of the manner two times, as for the divorce of the third.This is the saying of the Almighty after the remembrance of the two times, so he holds a well -known and said after it, then if you divorce it, then it is not permissible for him to be removed from it.[Al -Baqarah: 230] The verse was narrated like this interpretation of the Prophet ﷺ: Abu Bakr bin Bin Abi Shaiba narrated that “a man came to the Prophet ﷺ and he said: Two times, which is the third, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: I hold a good knowledge or relaxation with goodness.A known ruling either from the Sunnah, or from the rest of the verse, but he asked about the face of his saying two times.And when what was meant by the ruling of the race of divorce, by adopting his obtaining his actor, which is only obtained from the curtains, the memorization of the divorce was to the meaning of the peace, as well as the meaning Passing.And his saying two times, the time of one time, and the time in their words is the one act of one of its Sufism, or its addition, it does not fall into a neighbor, or with a journey, or with a junction In addition and its part, and falls into a paradise, and a gathering, so it is indicated by the effect of the verb, or the repetition of its verb, and the one is repent Interestingly, the Almighty said that we will torture them two times [Tawbah: 101] and the Arabs say: I ended you again, so you did not die; That is, a righteous, and the time is not mentioned in the sense of one of the things of the elderly, not to see that you say: I gave you a two -time dirham, if you give him a dirham, then they will not be.I gave him two darkens, and you are unaware of your saying: I gave you two dirhams.So he said that the highest time is two times that it is beneficial that the rejected divorce, in which the right to repeat it was made to a two -time limit.Once, one time, no other, so it is not deluded from it, in the understanding of the people of the tongue, that what is meant: the divorce is only two divorce That was the need for a pioneer to pay it, so he did not go away from my Arab recipient, and more group Among the use of interpretations in this verse and the separation of it, was buried with a generated understanding, and then they applied it to the righteousness of the new in the way The proof of the preacher divorce or its negation, and they are in their relaxation of the long saying that they are caused by the suffering of the recovery, and from the investigators who did not fulfill the meaning and did not fulfill the meaning His phrase as he fell in the scouts.It is permissible for the divorce to be the definition of the covenant, and the righteous is what is benefited from the saying of the Almighty and the divorcees are leving [Al -Baqarah: 228] to his saying In their response [Al -Baqarah: 228], it will be like a covenant in the male’s knowledge of his saying, and the male is not like the female [Al -Imran: 36], for it is a grace of what is from the one who is the one who does not say.ما في بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا [آل عمران: 35].And his saying is a constipation with a prestigious sentence on the verge of divorce two times, so the fulfillment will be for the punishment in the masculinity, not in the existence of the righteousness.And holding a starting and deleted news, its estimation (P-406), so the affair or the matter is a constipation with a well-being or a relaxation, on the way of the patience of the patience: And the permissibility is possible for every time of the time of divorce, the meaning was a constipation or a relaxation every time of the two times, that is, the time of the divorce is from the time of the time Punicly by returning with a well -known or leaving charity, that is, without a damage in both cases.And on it, the constipation and the relaxation of the source, what is meant by the truth and the name, without the will of a wise from the verb, and the meaning is that the divorced is on the head of it His wife, his mother, has gone, that is, her bulls, and if he did not want him, he would have left it, so she will leave her, and she will be left, and the one who is the one is the one With charity in the event of the bull, and in the event of its leaving, God has written charity on everything, as heroes for the acts of the people of the ignorance; As they may return the woman after divorce and then give it to your states, to remain a long time in a state of leaving it, as it was not for the time He possesses after the bull, and in this is a gift for what he wants after his saying, and it is not permissible for you to take from what they have come to.It is permissible to be a miserable and a relaxed export that made two sides of their actions, on the way of the divorced acting, which comes from the same, and the one who does not do it He changed the text to raise the meaning of the meaning, as it was amended from the text to raise it in the saying of the Almighty.The meaning of the matter, in the wildness of its action, and the permanent use of the revenue of the two exports, and the estimation, so they will hold or be happy.It turns out that the divorce is limited to two times, each of them is met with constipation After it, and relaxing with goodness on people to see after the divorce, what is appropriate for them and the condition And they feel what they might overlook his consequences when the divorce is created, from anger or from a sign, as he said, “Do not know, may God happen after that,” You are lightly, to be used to you and those who do that, so you have unjust himself and do not take the verses of God to shake [Al -Baqarah: 231], and that is for that, so that he can take it As they did before Islam.And it appeared from this that the intended of the sentence is the constipation or the relaxing of the divorces, and the possibility of the constipation of the well -being, and the sanctity of the charity, so it is a good man, so it is a good manner, so it is a good.The two states, a combination of guidance in the project.(P-407) The constipation was presented to the rest of the rally until it is the most important, which is desirable in the view of the law.And the constipation is the right to the hand of the hand over something that it will fall or be wrapped, and it is here to be a sense of the pans.And the relaxation against the constipation in its meaning: the real, and the metaphor, and it is a bothering here to abuse because of the pans after the divorce, and it is the reason for the return and then the arrival of that For separation, it is metaphorical with two arrangements.And what is known here is what people have known in their customers from the rights that Islam decided or decided by the customs that do not contradict the rulings of Islam.It is appropriate for the imams, because it includes all the rulings of the infallibility, all of which is the charity of the pensions, and otherwise, it is a best way from charity.As for relaxation, it is a dance and its knowledge is confined to charity to the separation by the good saying, and the vulgarity with the enjoyment, as he said, so they have come to them, so they used to be blessed.[Al -Ahzab: 49] The curtains were oppressed by the divorces and forbidding them from their sweetness, and their arrogance, and they multiply the stabbing in them.Is it said that you are held with charity or relaxation with a well -being.Not to be wronged from her right, so it is required to give and the money is more difficult on the souls than the good of the pamphlets, so the known is made with the constant, as it does not It is disturbed and the hard charity is made with the rest that is not remembered.The people have taken from the verse to prevent the collection between the three divorce in a word, based on the fact that what is meant by saying two times the separation and we will remember that Received it, so do not be permissible for him after [Al -Baqarah: 230] the verse.* * * It is not permissible for you to take from what you have come On them, when it was redeemed with it, it is permissible for the waw to be symptomatic, so it is a symptom between the emoters.And they say it is a constipation (P-408) and its saying, if it divorces it and it is permissible to be given to the charity, because it is from the charity of the tranquility that it is not the charity The divorce is a disadvantage of divorce, and this is a suitability for the coming of this symptom, and it is artistic artistic mastery in the collection of legislations and the discourse of the nation, so that it can be taken from it.He sings with it, for the husband stands from taking money: and the matter is judged by the number of his obligation, and the wife or the greatness To follow these things with the opinion of the opinion from the sides of the two sides, and the rest of the nation is commanded by the compliance of that, and this is the matter You are grateful for the mother of you [Women: 5] to his saying and gave them to them [Women: 5], and to him the owner of the scout indicated, and Ibn Attiyah said, Al -Qurtubi, and the owner of Al -Khattab: It is permissible for you to the elders of the villages of his saying that you take and say it, and you will come to them and the speech in his saying, so if you are afraid that you will not be the same for God, for God is for the sake For the Azal, it was said: If you are afraid, do not be evaluated or not to be able, he said in the scouts: We are like that, so unable And he seen it in the scouts by saying the exalted in the surah of the class and the good of the believers [Al -Saff: 13] on my opinion of the owner of the scout, as he made him a kind of grace.Etc.Because it is in the sense that they believe and guide any, so that it will be given to the general speeches of the nation, and if the tuberculosis is specific to the Messenger ﷺ, because it is not from it.And it appeared from the theorizing of the owner of the revelation to look at it with the words of the Almighty, while it comes: And if you divorce the women, then you will be released, then do not make them happy with them: [232] The divorced and the most beautiful, and they are surprised.The feminine guarantee in their coming is back to divorcees, the concept of his saying of divorce two times because the gender requires a number of divorces and the divorce That all of the rhetoric be for the judgments, and its first saying is to take.And his saying from what you have come to by the support of taking and coming to the rule The brightness is the same as the joke of the tafs, and the owner of the scouts, and others that the disobedience may occur with the hearts of a slave, so what the curtains came to the face of the face of the one who is the one who is the most On the hand of the ruler, then this face is invalidated, and the meaning is not permissible, and it is not permissible or permissible to allow it, and the resurrection of the solution and the prohibition, in this sense and its opposite, is a valid in the Arab Snacks for those who have been forbidden for him And for her, she did not prohibit (P-409) and said as a play: ؎ If a century is permissible, it is not permissible for him to be left to the Qur’an, and it is a new one who has been said by the saying of it.The mutilated in the dignity, warning against taking the least few with the difference of what if he said: money or the like, and this signed from the merits of the summons of the word “thing” Del the miracle.It was presented in the simplicity of that when he said, and let us give you anything of fear and hunger [Al -Baqarah: 155].And his saying, except that they are afraid of the reader, with the conquest of J, the absence, for the verb is a supporter of the risk, and the guarantee is based on the one who is the one who is the one who said that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said From what they have come to something, and so is a guarantee that they will not be able to live and destroy, so there is no wing to them, and this action was given to them without the rest of the mother of the mother They are.He read Hamza, Abu Jaafar, and Jacob, to be guaranteed by the cloudy and the verb is based on the deputy and the guarantee of the one who is the one; The actor is deleted is the guarantee of the addressees; And appreciation: except that you fear them, not the limits of God.And fear falls on what the soul is hated while it is against security.It is called his impact, which is the pursuit of the satisfaction of the fears of it, and the compliance of his orders as his saying, so do not fear them and fear if you are believers [Al -Imran: 175] Because the residence of God's limits is what the believer is afraid, and fear exceeds one effective one, he said, "Do not be afraid of them [Al -Imran: 175].And the poet said, “A man from a man who has been cooking his dog and his name was loved:“ He loved him, why did you eat it for his mother ∗∗∗ If God feared you, and God bless you Humanism, upon him the saying of Al -Ahwas in it, on one of the two things: ؎ If it goes away, it will go down to a deceased ∗∗∗ you fear its rayra on the sins and delete it To enter it on the source.Some of the interpreters have said: Fear is here in the sense of thinking, he wants the thought of the deceased; For fear is only called on the fact that the deceit is thought, and it is fearful with the original means.And the residence of God's limits, and the money of God, may God have mercy on him, was pleased by the possession of the husband, and the righteousness of it, and the righteousness of it, then if the woman is lost, then it is the same.“ And the one who is given in that is, "and a redeemed for the side of the inhabitants, and the shrine may be enrolled because the guerrilla is returned to it in particular; Because paying the money from it only.And the appearance of the general saying of his saying, as it was redeemed by it that it is permissible then the immorality is what increased the skill and the dispute will come in it.And the nation’s scholars did not cost that what is meant by the verse is taking the rituals on the parts, but they disagreed with this separation, is it divorce or dirt, The gathering went to the fact that it is divorce, and it is only clear; If it was not clear, the abnormal appeared in the humiliation of the rituals, and with it, Uthaman, Ali, Ali, Ibn Masoud, Al -Hassan, the tender, and the son of the son, Abu Hanifa, Al -Tuiri, Al -Awazi, Al -Sha’abi, Al -Nakha’i, Mujahid, and Makhoul.A jurisprudence went to the fact that he was dirty, and Ibn Abbas, a peasant, a generosity, a cruise, and Abu Thawar, and Ahmad ibn Hanbul, and everyone who said: And the saying of Al -Shafi’i missed in that, and he said once, he is a divorce; And he said once, not a divorce, and some of them tell about Al -Shafi’i that the immorality is not divorced, unless he intends to do the divorce, and it is correct that it is a divorce, and it is a divorce, They wanted to be immoral, the first of the grace in it, so what is all of it is not returned to the fools, and the appearance of this disagreement appears in the fullest between them.After the man divorced two divorces, then when the fans divorced the thirty, then it is not permissible for its analogy until after the husband, and the son, and the son of the son, And Isaac, and who agreed to them: it is not a divorce, and they are to hold a long -standing marriage.And this verse has been held by Said ibn Jabir, Al -Hassan, Ibn Sirin, and Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan, so they said: He will not be immoral except for the sake You did not fear the limits of God.And the gathering is on the permissibility of conducting immorality with the authority of a person, because the speech is not open to the ruling and it was true of Omar, and Uthaman, and Ibn Omar, that they have been permissible.Tribal.And the gathering is also permissible to take compensation on divorce.And they gathered that if it is a renovation of them, then it is forbidden for it, so Malik said: If the harm is established, the divorce is spent, and its money is rejected.Abu Hanifa said: It is a past, but it is the (P-411) based on its origin in the end, if the outside of what is forbidden from it.Al -Zuhri, Al -Nakha’i, and Dawid said: It is permissible only with the Nashaz and the division.The truth is that the verse is open to the prohibition of taking the rituals from divorce, unless he is afraid of the corruption of the pamphlets.It is the limits of God because the concept of the discretion is close to the wounds that if they are not afraid of that, the immorality is not permissible, and he assured him of his saying, then if you do not have any.A wing on them, while it was redeemed with it, because its concept is that if they were not afraid of that, the wing is proven, then all of that confirmed that all of it is the same Then, on the one hand, with his saying, and whoever is considered the limits of God, then those are the unjust and have all among that Bennat or the sister of Abdullah ibn Abi Ibn Salaoul, and between her husbands, Bin Qais Bin Shamas; When I said to him, O Messenger of God, neither I nor fixed.He turned a blind eye to her, the Prophet ﷺ you want him to be his neck, who believed you, I said yes and his increase.His saying, except that they are afraid that the limits of God will not be able to do the condition, but rather because it is the majority of the conditions A reprehensible one [Women: 4] This is the answer of the money, as in the rulings of Ibn Al -Arabi, and the interpretation of the Qaribbi.And when it is a false answer, and it is holding without exact, as for the denials of the universe in his verse, it is an arbitrary, and a script of the words of the face of it, and it is a matter And with their understanding, and that is its saying, and it is not permissible for you to take from what you have come They are afraid of his vanguard and concept, and his saying, if you are afraid of his mouth, like that, then the concept that comes to the way of the majority is the concept And the case, and the end, without what is not happening in the words except for the intention of the premature, such as the discretion, and the condition.As for the pilgrims for the pharaoh by saying it, if you have a soul from it, it is a soul from it [Women: 4], so his refuge in the forgiveness of the woman is from some of the righteous The charity, because the first of the verse and the women of their charity are a solution, for if we are blessed with you [Women: 4] the verse is a guidance for what is presented in the case of the infallibility, what is more Between the two verses, and if we gave our peace, he would have to look at your hearts, the whole of the two, or the survival.(P-412) And they disagreed about the pamble of taking the increase in what the separators believed, so he said, the bond, the tender, the Al-Awazi and the Isaac, and Ahmad: it is not permissible to take the Zaid, for the sake of God With his saying: From what they came to and begged, “The Prophet ﷺ said to Jamila, when she said to him: I respond to him with his neck and his increased On the authority of Ibn Jarraj.And the gathering said: It is permissible to take the increase to the general saying of the Almighty, so there is no wing on them, as it was redeemed with it and they were crowned with what the Darqi narrated it from, She was under a man from the supporters, married her to a sharpness, and he signed between them as a words, so they raised to the Messenger of God ﷺ So he said to her, and he will want him to say to him.Yes and his increase, so he said to her, and he was more and more intense for him.Malik said: It is not from The honor of the ethical and I did not see anyone of the people of science, which he hates, that is, he deprives him, and he did not correct what he narrated: As for the Zaid, no, and the truth is that the verse is a matter At the point of divorce, but God is permitted by the Almighty if it is the hatred and the blow from the woman in the principle of the pamphlets, in order to harm the husband in the loss He increases from him with a benefit; Because most of the hypocrisy falls on the principle of the pamphlets, not after the throat.And his saying: From what they came to, it appears that this is the place of the privilege, but the gathering is interpreted by it that it is the majority of what it is, and it is not the same.His saying when it was redeemed and your money has indicated his saying: It is not from the honor of the moral, that he does not see it as obligatory for corruption and the end; Because it is not from what is dispersed by a warning or a need, but rather it is a heal to improvements, and the work of Muslims has passed on his permissibility and disagreed with this, the mother of this Mansion: The gamborn is that it is a judge, and a jug said: It is a texture with the words of the Almighty, in the wall of the women.Take something from it [Women: 20] and the attribution of the mourning of Bakr Bin Abd Allah Al -Mazni, which is an abnormal saying, and the abundance of the verse of women in the man, who wants the woman, who wants the woman, who wants the woman, who wants the woman who wants the woman who wants the woman, who wants the woman who wants the woman, He will be forbidden to separate her, then he will increase, and he will take money from it, with the disagreement of the verse of the cows, as it is in the will of the woman in the way of its husbands from his deeds.* * * (P-413) That is the limits of God, so do not accommodate it, and whoever is considered the limits of God, for those who are unjust are the sentences of those who are the same It is permissible for you to take from what you have come to something and what it is connected to, and between the pre -emptive sentence on it, and it is if it divorced it, then it is not permissible for him: [230] And the appropriateness of the symptoms of what happened in the words that were before them from preventing the disadvantages of divorce, except in the case of fear that the limits of God will not be found, and it was the limits of God.So this is the opposite sentence; Because preventing muds from divorce is from the limits of God.And the limits of God is a sense of the laws and the Sharia, with the revelation of the signal, it was likened to the limits that are the conclusions between the rulings of the rulings, because the rulings of the rulings, because the rulings of the people, Distinguish between the permissible and the forbidden, the right and the falsehood, and separate between what the people were before Islam, and what they have after it.And residence in the truth, the emergence and the creation, it is said: He established a limit for his land, and it is here to be a business to work by the journey as a follower of the unrelated to the rulers of the rule The one who is the one who enjoys the limit on the violation of the rule of the law is a follow -up.The judgment is similar to it.And a sentence and whoever is considered the limits of God, then those who are unjust are a sacrifice, and a sentence benefited, for those who are unjust are an exclusive, and it is an exclusivity For the limits of God, the endowment of the one who is the one who limits the limits of God appeared in that he is unjust.And the name of the sign is from its saying, for those who are unjust are what is meant by it.To them.And it was released to the action of the ruling of God, to nominate, to develop the limits to the rulings of God, and it is with his nomination, and the slander of the rulings of the rulings, Because the violation of the matter and the end is similar to the equivalent of the limit in the accommodation on the owner of the opposite thing.And in the hadith, “No, every king has a fever, except that God is forbidden.”
