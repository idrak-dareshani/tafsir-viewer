The Quranic researcher, his argument, was raised.A magic that affects this is only the saying of the human beings.The symptoms hurry up the bid of him, and to hurry the path to the Prophet ﷺ.And a sentence that he thought and destined to be clear for a sentence that our verses were stubborn [Al -Muddathir: 16], so it is complementary and clear to it.And tags: torture and the unbearable, and its action is a joy, he said, and you do not care about my matter of hardship [Al -Kahf: 73] in Surah Al -Kahf.(P-307) Al-Sawad: The hard-and-hard obstacle is the hardship of the walker, and it is an exaggerated action from Sa`d, then the obstacle is difficult, then if it is the obstacle The usual is said to be: Sa`da.As if the origin of this description was that the obstacle was described as a ritual on the way of the mental metaphor, then that description was made the name of a gender.And his saying, I will see him as a representative, as against the condition that is beautiful in his saying, and I was guided by him.The world, then to the painful torment in the hereafter, and all of that exhaustion of it.It was said: It was a tendency to take away, and it was ascending itself, then he did not die and it was made for him from the torment of the fire, as the torment of the world.His Eid was distributed on what his work is required, because when his stubbornness was mentioned, and he is one of his intentions, the bad thing about his preservatives on his preservation and his preservation of his preservation on the authority of his preserve ﷺ This is one of the worldly purposes, it is a punishment for its return with what the torment of the world is in order.And when his stabbing was mentioned in the Qur’an by saying that this is only a magic that affects and denied that it is alive from God by saying that this is only the saying of the good With his saying, I will pray it.[Al -Muddathir: 26].And on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ “that Sa`aaa: a mountain in Hell, in which seventy seventy are shining in it, then he will ever in it.Al -Tirmidhi said: It is a strange hadith.So God made a liquidation of a flag on that mountain in hell.This is an interpretation of the greatness of what is indicated by his saying, I will give him a difficulty.And a sentence that he thought and estimated to the last of it, as a result of a sentence that our verses were stubborn [Al -Muddathir: 16] as a detection.He has described his condition in his frequency and his reflection on the verge of and a description.So he begins the remembrance of his thinking in the opinion that will be issued by him and his appreciation.And the meaning of (think) he did his thought and repeated his opinion to make an excuse for his virginity and promotes him in the dignity of the Qur’an in the Qur’an of the words He agreed that he is a neighborhood that I have revealed to him The Prophet ﷺ.(P-308) (and he was able) He was made as destiny for what is dangerous for his risk to describe the Qur’an to expose him to what is appropriate for what the Qur’an degrades from the types of the words of the words The prophet ﷺ from the people who are contrary to the conditions of the usual in the people, for example, to say in himself, we say: Muhammad is a madman, then he says: Evil, whispering, and not Muhammad, and then he says in himself: He is a poet, and he says in himself: I have known the poetry and heard the words of the poet The words of Muhammad like the words of the poet and then say in his soul: a priest, and he says in himself: He did not speak to him as a priest, and he does not say: We say it is a wizard, because magic separates between the woman and his welfare and Muhammad who separates the man, his family, his child, and his loyalists, and he said to the people: This is the meaning.And his saying, and he killed how he appreciated the words that are incompatible between (think) and (estimated) and between then he looked, which is the creation of a divine insult to the news of it, and he is the one who is a separation from the news.Because the one who is mentioned is angry with it.Fulfillment is to save his deeds from a bad deed, and the same in the symptoms, his words are exalted (and what we have sent before you is only a man who suggests to them, so ask them, so I ask them.Learn about the sons and the bees [Al -Nahl: 43]).And the separation does not contradict the syntax; Because the symptoms put the words between two words, they are connected with the severity of the view of what the sympathetic words are in line with it, so that it runs on what is required.And the call to symptoms is to hurry to the exaggeration of the speech to the fulfillment of it.And those who claimed: that the synthesis is not to be fulfilled, they have been delusional.And he was killed: a supplication to him to kill him a killer, meaning: a supplication for him to hurry his death; Because his life is a bad life.This supplication is used to be surprised by his money and lamentation for him as his saying, God killed them and their saying: Your promise, and his mother kicked him, and his mother has been done, and he will do the same Well, the situation is said: God fought what he encouraged.Al -Zamakhshari made him a nursery from his being, with an exaggeration, which the speaker is envied by him until the dead wish for him.And I think that the meaning of the envy is not good, but that is a pretext of limiting it to the words of that word of admiration or admiration because it has become like that.And the place here is the appointment of the place of its misfortune; Because what (P-309) appreciated it, which is not what the doors of the door are connected to his injury, as he has had the right to say, when he said: What is the contract of the magic, and no He thought, he said that this is only a magic that affects itself.And he said, then he was killed, how to confirm his perception of his perception.And compassion (then) benefits that its sum is more arranged than the one that before it in the marketing of the words.[Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
