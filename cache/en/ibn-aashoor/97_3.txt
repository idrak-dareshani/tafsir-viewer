The Quranic researcher (P-459) The night of destiny is better than a thousand months of two months, the first of the thumb that is in his saying: What do you realize what the night of destiny [destiny: 2] The obstacle [Al -Balad: 12] Follow the title [Country: 13] or the food of the verse.So the sentence was separated because it is a bayyan navigational, or because it is like a bayyan.And it is good for a thousand months, but it is weak in the best of the righteous works in it and the admiration of the supplication and the abundance of the reward of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness; Because the days are not the same as the measures of their Aznah, nor with what is happening in it from free or cold, or rain, nor its height or its shortness; If those conditions are not accustomed to God, the Exalted be exalted; But God is stubborn with what is made of goodness to people, individuals and groups, and what is concerned with the right, good and spreading religion.And he said in the best of people: If I honor you with God, I will fear you, so you are the best of the homeland, but it is measured by what he gets in it; Because it is an offense to the tanks and has subjective characteristics that can be preferred by the people of the people, so it is preferred by what God has prepared for it.The last night of the relatives, and the number of a thousand appears that it is used in the abundance of multiplication as his saying: (I find it as a thousand) and on it came the saying of God: A thousand years [Al -Baqarah: 96], but it was made the number of many here with the month of the pad on the faction that is the ritual ritual.And in Al -Muwala: His nation is not to be informed of the work like that, others have reached the length of life, so God gave him the night of destiny is better than a thousand months.And the appearance of the word (the night of destiny) in the place of the guarantee for the imitator, and this memorization has been disturbed by three times and the three times, it is finished with it, as it is the same.And some of them are a partner, who are their tongue with the book to calculate it from the book and what is from the book.And Adi said: I do not see the death that prevented the death, something that we have dwelt with richness and the poor, and from what the alert comes to him, what happened to him in the gathering of Al -Tarmah (P-460) Al-Haddani on the authority of Yusuf ibn Sa`d said: The believers; he said: Do not derive me It means: a river of paradise, and I came down, “We sent it down on the night of destiny [Al -Qadr: 1].A month, “The son of Umayyad owns it, Muhammad, Al -Qasim said: We have prepared it, so if it is a thousand months that does not increase a day or decrease it”).Abu Issa Al -Tarmahi said: This is an odd hadith that we only know from this face.It was said about Al -Qasim ibn al -Fadl on the authority of Yusuf ibn Mazen, we know it and the ibn al -Fadl al -Fadl Ibn Katheer said in his interpretation: Ibn Jarir narrated it from the way of the part of the virtue on the authority of Issa ibn Mazen, so he said, and Issa ibn Mazen is not known, and this is the same The hadith, meaning: to be obligated to them in the one who narrates the bond of Bin Al -Fadl; And on every involvement, it is unknown.And I say: Also, there is no benefit in his bond that Yusuf ibn Sa`d heard that of goodness - may God be pleased with him - and in the interpretation of the one who said: Al -Hasan: O Lord of the believers of the believers to the end of the hadith.Issa bin Mazen is not known in the first place; If we do the tropics of Yusuf ibn Sa`d, then it is not in his narration what is required that he heard him, but it is permissible for him to be the remembrance of the story of the story.The scholars ’suggestion agreed that it was a denial hadith; He stated that Ibn Katheer and his reminder of his good sheikh, and I say: He is the one who is the various meaning and the features of the place is clear to him, and he is from the place of the people So that he does not follow his example from goodness with the excess of his knowledge and his compassion, and any malevolent between what they claimed from the Lord of Ra’i Good deeds from himself.There is no doubt that this news is the subject of the preachers of the Abbasids that it is contrary to the occurrence; Because the period between the goodness of the good is the rivalry to the Ma’awiyyah and between the sacrifice of the joke, and it is the first of the creator of Abbasiya, a thousand months, two months, or a month, or a month, or a month, or a month or a month, In two months, what was attributed to the restriction of the Haddani from his saying: We prepared it, and we found it, etc.It is happening that this news that the Tramsi has been removed as a denial as the Muzi said.Ibn Arafa said, and in his saying: The night of destiny is better than a thousand of the most prominent, the name of the hoop As a skeleton in which the swimmer is in the glass of the glass, as if it is a dumping cock [light: 35] uh.He wants to fight what includes the two centuries in the fee and the continuity in the verse.And his example in the poetry is the saying of the other way: if the arguments come down, the ground is satisfactory.Etc.
