The researcher of the Qur’an killing the human being, what he disbelieves from anything that he created from a sperm that he created, then he destroyed him, then the path is easy, then he died, then he granted it, then he wanted it.A sedimentary exile that arose from the remembrance of those who took advantage of it, for I want one or more appointed one with it, and that shows him what was signed from the words of the words Sanads who are involved in the sitting in which the son of the mother of Maktoum entered.And the appropriateness and description of the Qur’an that it is a remembrance of those who want to remember, and when it was greater (P-120), their reasons for the absence of the Qur’an is the one With the belief in it, the reference was to the foster of the resurrection, the most important thing that he is in this memorial and that is from the affairs of his saying: Whoever wants to mention it.And who is known by his saying: (Whoever seeks to seek) is included in the general who was reported by (the human) from his saying: The human being was killed.And the act of killing so -and -so is a supplication to kill him.And the first interpreters made (killing the human being) that he was cursed, narrated by the laughter of Ibn Abbas, and he said Mujahid, Muqdah, and Abu Malik.He said in the scouts: a supplication for it, and this is one of their calls for their calls.That is: his referral is not the same as the Almighty saying: God fought and said: God fought so and so; They want to like it, and this is a reference to the recovery and there is no reason to hold it on the like; Because he said: What I disbelieve will sing about that.And the supplication of worsening from God is an anesthetic that is used to complacency and support for the appearance that the truth of the supplication does not suit the divine; Because God is the one who turns to people with the supplication.And by building (killing) for the unknown, it is separated from its use in the supplication, as there is no abuse in a killer who kills him, and he has many in the Qur’an based on the sake Rest [Al -Muddathir: 19].And the definition of (the human) may be the name of the name of the gender, and it will benefit the exploitation The individuals, according to the readers, are generated by the form of exploiting a claim of the number of people who are invested in a few of the individuals, and the expulsion is called the nursing in the world, Including the divisions of the scholars of the origins, and the presidency here is what the disbelief of the human being shown from it: from anything that created it to the saying of it, then if it is, then it is: What is meant is from his saying: (human), the rich, denounced, and on that, the senior of the interpreters, for the most Arab of the Arabs is enough.Mujahid said: It was not in the Qur’an (the human being was killed), so the infidel meant me.And the rulings that are judged by the sexes that are wanted to be overwhelmed by gender, so the darkening (P-121), which is required to be a conservation of gender My wedding It is based on the confirmation of the judgment of the Messiah on the sentence, so it is not necessary to equate all the individuals with it, but they may leave it for some of the individuals, and it has been given to the one who has the absence of it.Sometimes, his saying: (What is disbelieving it) is surprised by the disbelief of the humanity of the human being or the intensity of his disbelief, even if the little of it is unbelieving.The meaning of the human being to the infidels is from this race, and they are mostly on the type of human being.The majority of people disbelieved in God from the oldest of the rocks of the rocks, the disbelief between the individuals of the human being, and they were victorious to Him and struggle for it.It is not surprising that the disbelievers of those who deem the miracles of the struggles of a carpentry and a wood, or they deny that they have the Lord of their creation.It is permissible for a person to be known to be the covenant of a person who is appointed from the human being who is appointed by the news of the causes From his souls, whom the son of the mother of Maktoum was deceived, and when the first one would have wanted Al -Walid ibn al -Mughira.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the intention is the son of Abi Lahab, and he mentioned a story that has no relationship with the news of the sitting, whom the son of the mother of the mother of the mother Summary, premature, and the appropriate appearances.And the sentence (what I disbelieves) is an inception to create the supplication upon which the supplication of recklessness and supplies.This is a miracle of the severity of this human being.And the meaning of the intensity of disbelief is that its disbelief is a quantity, how, and a dead, because it is the disbelief in the bodies of God, and its ability to return the creation of the one who is the one The Messenger, and the way to it ﷺ, and that it is a strong disbelief; Because it is a strong criticism that does not accept jokes, and that it is a continued that is not quoted with it with the repetition of remembrance, warning, and support.This sentence has reached the end of the brevity and raised the earthquake with thickens, indicating the defamation in the language of the limit of the slander, a gathering of the words, and it is not the same, and it is not.One of the domains of the word Quranic.(P-122) The comment was removed by the word (disbelieved) because it appears from the cure (disbelief) and its estimation: what I disbelieve in God.And in his saying: The human being was killed by what is the best of the advantages, so it is from the sea of ​​the sand from his first display.And a whole of anything created by Bayan for a sentence of killing the human being, what he disbelieves; Because this sentence is based on the abandonment of the missionary and that denial of the greatest of their infidels.Come on in this question with a question of a question and an answer to the way to the guarantee, and for that the vertigo of the insulting to the answer to it on the way of the ritual in the way They wonder about the great prophecy [the Prophet: 1].And the questioning is a picture, and the one who is understood from it is made of the matter that the human being created; Because the place here is not to prove that God created the human being, but the place is to prove that the creation can be re -fired With the first creation on the way of his Almighty saying: We are aware of the first creation [Q: 15], meaning: as the creation of the human being was the first time from a sperm, which is a second one, whoever creates a second one.And his counterpart is the Almighty saying: Let the human being from what was created [Al -Tariq: 5] created from a dug water [Al -Tariq: 6] He comes out from the crucifixion and the chairs [Al -Tariq: 7] [Al -Tariq: 8] In Surah Al -Tarq.And the guarantee that is shown in his saying: (created by him) is based on God, the Almighty is known from the verb of creation; Because the two participants were not denying that God is the human being.The neighbor and the boundaries were presented in his saying: (From a sperm created it), a simulation of the presentation of the indicated in the question that requires its validity, as it is the same, With the fulfillment of the presentation of the creation, because of the presentation of it from the alerts to the greatness of the great wisdom of God Almighty; He was formed by a well -known creature of the lowerness of something, which is the sperm.Rather, he did not seek refraining from returning the verb (created it) in the sentence of the answer with the knowledge of it by submitting to the remembrance of the one who has obtained it in the question of the increase in the abuse of the one.(P-123) The reaction of the verb (its creation) in the equality of equality is not briefly, and it is not with sneaks.And the sperm: the little water, which is a verb in the sense of an effective, such as their saying: the arrest of love, and the light of water.And the launch of the sperm was overwhelmed by the water from which the reproductive is, so the sperm was mentioned to see its remembrance because it is the material of the creation of the animal of the sign of the man So the mission has occurred, and it is not in the remembrance of the severity here.Because this is the intention of that, the place here is the significance of a great creation, and it is not the place of the oldest and the old.And he was raised on the verb (created it), so it (his appreciation) with the fulfillment of the separation; Because the ability here finds the thing on an organized and regrettable estimated, as he said, the Almighty: He created everything, and his estimation was fed.Creation because he created it is prepared for the growth and what he is dressed in the mind and the behavior, and it can be able to look at his mind, and the hopes that he wants to do, Surprisingly.This is the separation and what was overlooked by a integration of the teeth through the recipient.And he added (then) from his saying: Then the path is easy for the arrogant cries; Because the path of human work is more impressive in the significance of the manufacture of the makers of God; Because it has the effect of the mind, which is the greatest in the creation of the human being, and it is stronger in the time.Al -Sabil: The way, and he is arrogant to what the human being does from his business and his disciplines, similar to the tanks with a way in which he walks with walking.It is permissible for him to be a slogan to drop the lord from the stomach of his mother, so he was released on That path is the name of the way in their saying (the two ways), so this is from the recovery in his metaphors.And it is a suitable for his saying after him, then he died, and he granted him, so he (his death) met with (his creation), and (he granted him), and then the way is easy; Because the rackets are an ingeniousness in the land, and it is against the mud of the lord to the ground.Al-Taysir: Al-Tasheel, and (Al-Sibil) is based on an effective verb on the way (P-124) of the assignment, and the guarantee is a source of (the way).And appreciation: the path is easy for him, as his saying: The Qur’an is pleased with the remembrance [the moon: 17] meaning: the remembrance of people.And the (al -Sabil) is presented to the verb of the pace with the lesson of the path of the way, with the meaning of the metaphor, and it is a sponsor of the lifespan.Likewise, he (then his death) on (facilitated it) with the war of crudeness, and it is for the screams of the rank, for that the lending of these mental powers and the goodness is that it was a time.What is a wondrous lending without taught or waiting for a time that equals the period of its survival, and this is a integration of the significance of the great ability.It is known that the many who are not the same as the individuals of humanity, his command has become to death and that whoever is alive is a referral, not a referral, then the meaning is: The form of the one who is going on in his saying: (his death) is used in his right, and he is dead who died, and his metaphor is the death of those who will die; Because their death in the future is achieved.And the remembrance of a sentence (then his death) is a slowdown and a gift for a sentence (so he granted it).And the chain of illness to God is the highest mindset, according to the knowledge of the recipient.This is a integration of the delegation through the cursing, as it was intended, and it is destined, then the path is pleased with it before.And (he set it) made it a grave, and it is more special than the meaning of his grave, meaning that God caused him to be granted.Al -Farah said: That is: (He made it a grave, and it did not make it from those who are thrown to the bird and the predecessor, and no one who is thrown into the bonds) It is in it the dead and it is made in a house or its surroundings.And the Qabar: The grave is prepared.It is said: He also set it up, if he commands that he be granted, and it is said: He granted the dead, if he buried it, then the meaning: that God made people with a grave.And the chain of gravity of God to God is a mental metaphor; Because God, the people of the burial, as in the story of the burial of one of the sons of Adam, his brother, with the delusion of his imitation of the act of a hole for another western (P-125) He saw it in it, and it is in the wall of the contracts.This was confirmed by what was commanded in his bodies from the beginning of the dead.And the saying that the form of the past is used in its right and metaphor, the counterpart of the saying in the form of (his death).This is all evidence of the great ability And their levels and entrusting their forces are life, and their honor is a mother with burial so that the human being is like the one who is the one who avoids the sons of his soul, and the sons of his life The predecessor and the stretching of the good and the dogs, so the one who has been said in his saying: (Then his family) is while he was spread over him by fulfilling his saying: (So).In the verse, there is an indication that the burial of the peoples of the people with the cabinets without the burning of the fire, as it does the inhabitants of the Indian, and without the meeting in the way of the ritual in the mountains With two grandparents, without a stood, as the mosque of the Persians did, and the people of the ignorance did it with the dead of war and raids in the Fafi, as they did not go to them, and they did not.With that and wishing him, Al -Shanfari said: Do not be granted to me that my grave is forbidden to you, but my father is a mother who wants to eat it, and the launder The Prophet ﷺ was buried the testimony of the Muslims on one day in the shared graves, and the killing of the partners was killed by a minor in Qalib.؎ I did not burn the killing of you ∗∗∗ So they smoked the woman and made it clear and the sentence, then if he wants to spread it, there is no return to prove the resurrection, and it is like a result.And his saying was signed: (If he wants), it is opposite between the sentence (his death) and the sentence (spreading it) to return the delusion of the two partners that the abuse of the murmur is the same The recipient and (if) is a disagreement for the future, then the action of the one after it is followed by the future.The meaning: Then when he will spread it, that is, it will be published when his will are attached to his opinion.(P-126) And spread it from the earth, and the origin of the publication is the disappointed thing, it is said: the spread of the garment, as it removed its fold, and spread the newspaper, if it is clear.And from the hadith, they spread the teeth.As for the spread of the prodigy, it is specific to the death of the dead from the earth alive, which is the resurrection, it is permissible to say: the publication of the dead, and the Arabs did not be the ones who are not.They said in their imaginations of delusion, so the saying of the east will be from him: ؎ The people say what they have seen ∗∗∗, wondering to the God of the Prophet, and God said: You are after the death after the death of those who disbelieve, if this is nothing but a clear magic [Hood: 7].And in his saying: (If he wants) a response to their similarity, as they were asking to hurry the mission by limiting and insulting to make it not the same It is, so God knows them that he is sitting when God will be brought up and not in the time that they ask; Because it is a member of the wisdom of God and the benefit of their saying from the way of the kiniyah.
