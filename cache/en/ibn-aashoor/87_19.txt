The Quranic researcher is that this is in the first newspapers.A clearness of the words and its intelligence with it that it is one of the righteous words that are in the books of Abraham and Moussa, peace be upon them.The message of Abraham and Risala Moses, and that confirmed this news that the blame is that it is a market to the denunciations.(P-291) And the sign of this word to the group of his saying: He has succeeded whoever zakat [the highest: 14] to his saying: He is more than what is before that from the first of the first Whoever recommends [the highest: 14] is not what you have proven in the newspapers of Abraham and Moses, peace be upon them.Ibn Merdawi and Al -Ajri narrated from Abu Dhrar who said: I said, O Messenger of God, did you come down to you from what was in the newspapers of Abraham and Moses?He said: Yes, I will succeed whoever zakat [the highest: 14] and mentioned the name of his Lord, and he was pray This hadith.And the meaning of Al -Zarfiya in its saying: In the newspapers, it is similar in the meaning written in the first newspapers, so the newspapers were released on what is written in it, as it is written on the face In his words, he said: Our Lord has a hurry, our cat [p.16], meaning: what is in our cat and he is the instrument of the work.And Al -Sahaf: A group of a newspaper other than a measure; Because the measuring of his collection is a deity, but it is with his being, it is not measured, it is the most correct, as they said: Suffhered in the collection of a ship, and the face of the gathering Sobes, and Moses had many newspapers, and it is a group of newspapers.The arrogance of the words came to the levels of the bumps and detailing, so that this news is more, a report in the dedication of people, and his saying: The pipelines of Ibrahim and Moses.And the first: a description of the Sahaf, who is the collection of breaking it, so it has the ruling of the ritual, and the first is a formula of preference, and it is different in the original letters of the first person: The origins are a wow (a deceased), so it is a lord that mentioned it in the tongue, so it will be the first time: the first, the second gossip was turned over, and it was tweet in the waw.It was said: Its origins: and time and blame and that the gambling that is in the first is more and a first time: I do and slurry one of the darkness.It was said: Its original forests are wow, and a lameness, and the first is first, or by the weight, and I did the heart of the gossip that after the waw wow, And the first: feminine, I do from this material, either we say: its origin is the first (P-292), the waw resided in a dead silencer for its struggle, the one who has a shower, or the origin of it.Anesthesia in his first and dwells in the second waw, too, or its origin: and the guaranteed waws, then a dwarf, so that it is a heart in it, so it is a heart, so it is a heart.I am forgiven.What is meant by the priority in the description of the newspapers is the precedent It is preceded by others; Because it was narrated that some of the messengers were before Abraham, and a newspapers were revealed to them.It is a description of the first one in his saying: And that your family is the first one [Al -Najm: 50] and his saying is up to the Almighty: This is a vow from the first vow [Al -Najm: 56] and in the hadith of Al -Bukhari: The words of the first prophecy, if you are not ashamed, make what you want." Abd al -Hamid, Ibn Mardwiya and Ibn Asakir and Abu Bakr al -Ajri were narrated from Abu Dhir on the authority of the Messenger of God ﷺ “that the Sahf al -Abraham.” * * * (P-293) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of the Grace, which was named in the Qur’an and interpretations (Surah Al-Jashia).Likewise, her symbolism cursed her in the book of interpretation from his college, because of the fact that it is noticed (Al -Ghaffiya) at the beginning.And it was established in the Sunnah, its name is (did you come to the hadith of Al -Ghashiyyah [Al -Ghashiyyah: 1]).Al -Juma with the Surda Al -Juma?This is an apparent name; Because the liquid asked what he reads with the collection of the collection, then the second surah is responsible for the second surah, and that is its Bukhari curse in the book of interpretation.Perhaps it was called (Surah, I come to you), with the words of the word (the hadith of Al -Ghashiya).And that was cursed by Ibn Attiyah in his interpretation, and he is a short.It is an angel with agreement.It is the numbers of the seven and the sixty in the meter of the liquefy, the surrounding of the Surahs came down and before the Surah of the Cave.Her signs are six and ten.* * * This surah was completed on the day of the Day of Resurrection and the punishment of the people who are distorted, and from the reward of a soft people, and the face of the face and the face of the face or the face Desired.And gesture to what all of the nodes shows all the denials of people who did not be guided by (P-294) creatures of the creation of God, and they are the ears of their eyes.So the Samaid knows that the threatening junction are the partners.And it can be returned to some of his creatures, a new creation after the death on the day of the resurrection.The Prophet ﷺ was proven on the preacher to Islam and that they do not disturb their symptoms.And behind them, the mission is, and they are returned to God, so they are rewarded for their disbelief and their symptoms.
