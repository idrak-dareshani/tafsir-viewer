The researcher, who came to those who gave the book with every verse that you followed before you, and what you are following before them It is from the knowledge that you are from the oppressors, and if you have a kindness on his saying, and those who have given the book to know [Al -Baqarah: 144], and the appropriateness is that they do not know I am helping that they know that the right to the advanced direction in his testimony is that they are persevered in the way that they have caused the negation To pay the delusion to reassure them with their followers because they know its right, so the sentence indicates the extent of the denial The coat, and the relationship to the most usual.What is meant by those who have gave the book [Al -Baqarah: 144] The intention of what is said by his saying, and those who have given the book to know [Al -Baqarah: 144] on what is presented, then what is done is what he does.It is a valid for their food, so if they do not follow their incers before Islam, then I will be found in their food that they do not follow it.The appearance is directed in the place of guaranteeing here, the advertisement with their vilification until this sentence is openly in their cultivation, as is the matter in the appearance in the end of the The intended from it is the increase in care and being able to do so.And what is meant by every verse: proliferation verses, and what is meant by the verse: the argument and the evidence that the kissa is the kiss of the Hanafi.And the release of the memorization of “every” is a great lot in the words of the Arabs.A metaphor to make many of the individuals similar to the group of the generalities of his individuals, then many of that until the truth was equal, so it became a matter of all of me.Its Qur’an, nor to the advertisement that the many number likened to the rituals of gender with all his individuals until he responds, while he does not imagine in which he is a blindness With every verse, the verses are not envisioned for a number that is surrounded by it, and the same is the saying of the Almighty, and then I will be all of all the fruits [Al -Nahl: 69] and his saying is that the one who has the right Your Lord does not believe [Yunus: 96] and if they came to every verse [Yunus: 97], and the napstel said: “It is all the same and the majesty of my raises ∗∗∗ to every man from the one who is the one who is the same Mitteries in the saying of Antar: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ The doorstep and the owner of the dictionary said in the material “All”: The seizures of “every“ meaning ”came after one, so the abode of the meaning of the meaning of it was established in the meaning "Some" and the fast was to say in the sense of "a lot." The meaning: that their denials are a right The Kaaba is not about the suspicion until the Hajj removes, but it is an arrogance and stubbornness, so there is no seriousness in the sneaks of the rugs.And the addition of “kissing” to the conscience of the Messenger, because it was devoted to it to be before his law, and because he asked her for the situation.And the individuals of the kiss in his saying, and what you are following their kisses with their two kisses, if each of the people of the book has a kiss, and no They have a specific kiss and they were good in receiving the flaws.It was not followed before the other sect.What is meant by his saying is what you followed before you, the emergence of their perseverance, is a sense of their faith, and from his saying, and what you are following the followers of their prestige With the same from the return of the believer to (P-37), the house of the sanctuary, and in his saying, and some of them with a follow-up before some of the people of this, are the same From the disagreement, some of them are some of them in their kisses until the Christians came before the Jews with the fact that the project of Jews is the origin of Nasran.And a sentence, and if you follow their whims, it is given to a sentence, and what you are following their kisses, and what is between them, and there is a lot of symptoms.Conservation of the matter by receiving the Kaaba, and warning against the hatred in that, in which it is exposed to the face of the impersonation, that if he followed the whims of the whims of you, and for the whims of the good The signed was now; Because it has the arms of doubt, and the imposition of the condition.And his saying from science is a bay for what came to you, that is, after the one who came to you, and who is the science, so he made what was revealed to him is all of it on the face of the vagina.And the whims: the collection of the fun, which is the vicious love, in which it requires the request of the love of the love, and if it is a harmful crop of it, then it is the same A love that is not required by the adult or the mind, and then it was called the love, and the firing of passion was spread in the Qur’an on the neck of misguidance, and then he called the scholars of the scholar The rudder in the people of the whims, and it has been exaggerated in this warning by the casualization of the condition of the condition and the penalty on the number of assertions, and the owner of the man was fulfilled to the owner of the man.Ten, which is: the oath is the one who is overwhelmed by the blame, and the blame for the division is because it increases the oath of affirmation, and the disguise of confirmation in the sentence of the reward, Tell it, the name of the sentence, and make the condition of the condition that indicates the suspicion, which is “the“ required ”that the least part of the followers of their passion is sufficient in the darkness, Permanently, it has confirmed the link of the penalty with the condition, and the exalt Knowledge is that it indicates the fulfillment and the fulfillment of the parallel, which leads to the achievement of punishment for the adoption of the obedience of excuse, and made what we have.And the definition in the unjust indicating that it is one of those who are in this description that is a prostration.It is not hidden that everything that leads to the achievement of the link between the penalty and the condition, or the achievement of its reason (P-38) or the achievement of the part of the penalty, or the omission of it, Thus, the intended is confirmed by the market for the condition of the condition.And expressing the knowledge here of the revelation and the divine, the advertisement of its core, the knowledge Listen.And his saying to the oppressors is the strongest significance of the words of the darkness from: You are a shadow, what you say when he said: “I seek refuge in God.” And what is meant by the unjust shadows is their souls, and the shadow has the paths of all of them under this description and the silence.Driving from the darkness of the soul of the soul until it ends to their lost deposits, so their injustice ends with themselves to the infidels in the immortal of torment.He may say that a relative of this sentence is presented to him when he said: The Almighty said that the guidance of God is the guidance and if you follow their whims after you are from the one who came to you from the one who comes from you Nasir [Al -Baqarah: 120] So he crossed your name in the name of the communication that and crossed here in the name of the communication, and he said here after and said here after, and he made the reward of the part We are a foreground, and the part made here be from the unjust, and this question has been received by the "dome of the download and the deception of the interpretation" and he tried to show the abstraction The two verses differed, and it did not come with what he heals, and who is guided to him as his words to say that the one who and if they were shared in that they are a name The connection, and when the knowledge that came to the prophet ﷺ in the abuse of the first verse is the science that is attached to the origin of the religion of Islam and the throat of the mourning of the mourning, And by the misfortunes of the two companions in the health of Muhammad al -Muhammad ﷺ, this is a result of his words, and he said: “God takes his children to his grace.” [Al -Baqarah: 116] 120] And there was no crime that was the knowledge that came in that was the knowledge of the science and its oldest, and it was true that he was expressed in the name of the chart in the arrival.As for the second verse that we are in its authenticity, it is attached to the abuse of the Jews and the Christians, because it is preceded by the statement of that, from the saying People are not about their kisses, which they were upon them [Al -Baqarah: 142] And that is a promotion of a pioneer, so the warning after it is a warning against the followers of the two parties in the matter (P-39) kissing, and that is not the same Following their domesticity with her family, so it was not for the knowledge that the Prophet came in something before them He came in his awareness in the name of the follower, which is attached to the knowledge, which is because it is in the original, a boundary, and it is transferred to the person.Rather, it was entered from this second verse after his saying after what came from the knowledge that this verse came to you after the first verse in the first verse in the first verse in the first verse.After a chapter, the knowledge in which he came from his saying was what you followed before you, and it is part of the general knowledge of the knowledge that came in the heights of all the mortality It is partly for him with revenue from “” from “”.
