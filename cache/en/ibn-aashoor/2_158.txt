The Quranic researcher is that it is the description and the murky of the rituals of God, so whoever performs the pilgrimage of the house or is a single, then there is no ward to it to be deceived by them and whoever is varying is good, for God is good Between the argument of the people of the book and the partners in the matter of kissing, this descended by the reason for the frequency and the obligation between the Muslims in the matter The deposit, as it came in the hadith of Aisha, the next one, then this verse came down after the verses before it and after the verses that we read after it, because the pilgrimage was not The verses that commanded the Messenger of God ﷺ to attach them to some of the light that came down before we descended with a period, and the appropriateness between it and between it is that it is between it The luxury and the bitterness liken the verb of those who express them with foolishness from the kiss and the denial of (P-59) who are not able In this place, the occurrence of symptoms in the sympathy of the symptoms, so the endeavor was between the locking and the murder of the pilgrimage from the time of the Imam, peace be upon him.And her son Asmail, as God saved him from the thirst, as in the hadith of Bukhari in the book of the beginning of creation from Ibn Abbas on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ “that the mother of the mother With the position of Mecca, with her son, while he was satisfied, and he left for her a jacket of dates and water in which there is water, so when he ran out in the water, she thirsts and thirsts for her son and made her son.So, it was launched to look at it, and the luxury found a mountain that followed it, and it was based on it, then I received the valley, you look at anyone, so you will see no And the murder came, and it was based on it, so she looked, did you see anyone, and you did not see anyone, so she did seven times, Ibn Abbas said, and the Prophet said: She heard a voice, and I said in its soul, then I heard it, too With his punishment until the water appeared, and she was buried and breastfed her son.The hearing of his right to the verbs of the pilgrimage, or that whoever comes from his children did that, then he decided in the divisions at a Quraysh, not a referral.It was around the kaaba in the ignorance of the stone, which were from the sentences of the idols that Amr ibn Lahi came to the Mecca, and the Arabs worshiped by one of them, and the name of the other was called.One of them is a place that is close to the rock of the Kaaba and the other is a place that is near, and then they transferred the one who approached the kaaba to the side of Zamzam, and the Arabs were When Abd al -Mutlaq renewed, he would have been Zamzam, after being inherited.Their jewelry when they were permitted from Makkah and the sons of Saqiya Zamzam, the two idols were transferred, so he put a ravine on the locking and the wandering of the bitterness, and made it the same A young and a single between the two mountains in the way of the pursuit, so the Arabs who came after that after that is that the endeavor between the locking and the bitterness, and the one who was the one who was And Al -Khazraj and Jasan are worshiped by the channel, and it is a idol of the crucifixion.While he commented on Ma’mar to Aisha, she said: “The men of the supporters were from whom he would be for the patience.The Mecca was opened, the idols were removed, and the rituals were permitted by the house, and the Muslim pilgrims with my father, Bakr, and Quraysh sought between the Safah and the Marjah from the ritual And the bitterness and asked the collection of the prophet ﷺ, is we from the embarrassment that we are circumcised between the row and the bitter, so God revealed this verse." Malik, may God have mercy on him, narrated in the shelter on the authority of Hesham ibn Urwah from his father, Aroudah ibn Al -Zubayr, who said: I said to Aisha - and I am the day God Almighty is the description and the murder of the rituals of God, so whoever performs the pilgrimage or is a single, then there is no ward to it to be deceived by them, so what is on the one who does not have something to do with them.If it was as she said, she would not have been: there is no wing that he should not deplete with them, but his verse was revealed in the supporters, who were humiliating to the patience, and it was a man.They are embarrassed to circumambulate between Safah and Al -Marwah, so when Islam came, they asked the Messenger of God about that, so God revealed the luxury and the murmur.In Al -Bukhari, on the authority of Anas, “We would see that they are from the ignorance of the ignorant, so when Islam came to our grabbing them, then God revealed that the locking and the bitterness”, and in it the words The ignorance does not float between Safah and Al -Marwah, a great man So I am sure of the sentence that because the addressees are expelled in their being from the rituals of God and they are inclined to the belief that the pursuit is among them from the conditions of the ignorance For Al -Wahidi: that their question was the year of the pilgrimage, and all of it appears that this verse came down after we descended a verse that turned the kiss of the kiss in this way.The position to take into account the occasion with the verses mentioned in the confusion of difference in the matter of kissing and impressive.And Al -Safah and Al -Marwah: Aman of two abnormal mountains.It was called the Safah because his carpentry is from the locking, which is the stagnant stone, and the name was called Marwah because its carpentry is from the bitter, which is the clear, clear stroke that turns the fire and sacrifices it because its fragrance is brought out a severity of the one who is the same So Abu Dhuib said: ؎ As if I had tested, they are bitter with the description of the stained every day that is separated (P-61), as if the God of God is not.They have a mountain from the bitterness for their integrity in their assets and in their flames, and made his loud turn to his integrity in their construction.And the description and the paradise of the prohibition of the mosque and between them the distance of seven and seventy arm, and the way of the pursuit between them, the example of the mosque of the mosque, A chapter called the chapter of Safah from the gates of the mosque and the endeavor ascends to the lock and the paradigm with the same as the one who is cursed, and the rituals are the gathering of a ritual with the opening of the Shane and the slogan The mark is derived from those who feel if he knew and caught it, and it is an effective in the sense of the one who is known, that is, knowing it, and from it, their saying: I feel the camel if it is made in it.To guide.The people are what was made a mark on the performance of the work of Hajj and Umrah, which is the great positions, such as the timings that fall into the forbidden, and from the ka’mah, and the ritual, and the sake of the ka’m, And the murmur, the knowledge of the forbidden, and the ritual of the dazzle.And the meaning of description of the description and the murder that they are among the rituals of God that God made them two flags at the place of worship as the name of the pilgrimage, the time of the time The pursuit of them is a worship, as it does not comment with them, and they are made a brand that is not the pursuit between them, and they added to God because they are the one who is a matter Make them like that.And his saying, whoever performs the pilgrimage of the house is a separation of them from the rituals of God, and that the pursuit between them in Hajj and Umrah is from your insults, so he does not give him what he is in the way Because the sanctified thing does not remove its sanctification of what he is filled with a bad syntax, and for that, he alerted his saying, so there is no wing on the negation of what is wrong with what is wrong.As in the hadith of Aroudah on Aisha, may God be pleased with her.And the wing: the gym of the gym is a derived from a wings if it is money because the sin is inclined by the woman from the way of goodness, so be considered in it the mile on the authority of the goodness of the goodness in it.On the authority of evil to good.And the pilgrimage: a name in the language of the intention, and in the nose, on the intention of the forbidden house, which is in the Mecca of the worship of God, may He be exalted, in which the rituals, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness of the By release a normal realistic in this sense, an sweetener is like a flag of prevailing, and for that he said in the scouts: They are the pilgrimage and Umrah, in the suffering, as well Reminded to me except In the place of the acquisition of secession, and for that he was mentioned in the Qur’an, cut off from the addition of the pilgrimage, the most important known is [Al-Baqarah: 197] to the saying of it (p-62) And he was added in his saying, and God has the pilgrimage of the house [Al -Imran: 97] because it is the place of the project of project, so it is the place of Bayan and Tanab.And the verb of Hajj in the sense of a intention, which was not cut off from the intention of the intention in the words of the Arabs, so he was the remembrance of the act of the increase in the Bayan.As for the validity of your saying: Hajj is so, and his saying ﷺ “God has written on you the pilgrimage and perform Hajj” with the remembrance of the verb, so that the slander of the rituals The dominance of the verb’s release on the intention of the house is less than the dominance of the name of the pilgrimage on that intent.And Umrah: a name for the veil of the house, as well as the time of the pilgrimage, or at its time, with the presence of the presence of a custom, so the Umrah is the same to the pilgrimage, the same as the prayer of the prayer.In the form of the name, the knowledge of the dominance on the vision of the kaaba, and its action is overwhelmed by that visits, as follows for the dominance of the name, so it is good for it, and for that, it is not the same.And the prevalence in every case does not prevent the other release.And the exile of the wing is about the one who floats between the locking and the bitterness does not indicate more than it is other than it, so it is not permissible for him to be believed by the permissible, the delegate, and the duty, and the obligatory In it, he will be believed by all the male, so he needs to prove his judgment to another indication, and for that, Aisha said to Arab He passed away with them, Ibn Al -Arabi said in the rulings of the Qur’an: The saying of the saying: There is no wing for you to do a pornography for the verb and his saying: No gun To leave the verb, then this memorization did not come to the pornography of leaving the circumambulation, and there is no indication of it, but it came to benefit the pornography It is in the ignorance, intended for the idols in which it was in it.It is intended that there is no wing to you to do a text in the denial of the richness of the subject, and it is true to pornography, scarring, and obligatory It is a text in the next denial of the next ingredient, and it is true to the prohibition of the verb and its virginity, so it is in one of them a beautiful, yes, the confirmation of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people That action is a thought of being a variety of people.The scarring and the duty, as no one is intended to be obligatory, unjust, or delegated (P-63), and he says in it that there is no wing to you in his verb, for the one who does not do so From the verse, the pleasure The language is because it is one of the people of the tongue, not that here is a preacher to express the exile of the sin of the pursuit, and he thought many of the Muslims, that there is a sin, so that there is a sin, so that there is a sin.On the authority of Al -Sa’i, it is the opposite of the suspicion of what indicates his elaboration with the knowledge of the extent of the purpose of the purpose of pornography in the sense of the two parties of the two parties with what is the one who is a matter The verse or the precedent is for it, and this is what he said when he narrated it: And I am the day of the hadith of the Sunnah, he wants that there is no knowledge of him with the Sunnah and the reasons for the descent, His ignorance of the language is that the language is equal in the realization of its hadith and the great, and this also said to him, Aisha: Simally, you said, O son of his sister, To him from bad understanding of the intention of the Qur’an, if it is upon his understanding of that, on their habit in the frankness in the saying of the truth, then the appearance of the verse became the same With the knowledge of the confrontation of the exile of the ingredient of the sect between Safah and Al -Marawah.The exile in the verse is a wing offered to the endeavor between Safah and Al -Marwah in the text of the arms and abundance of them, and it is not for the pursuit of the pursuit, so when it is still in the way of the sake The exalted, there is no wing for them to reconcile between them, and the reconciliation is better [Women: 128], so the wing was exiled from reconciliation and proven to him that it is good, and it is good for the good He accepted it from the causes of the emergence and symptoms, and the same is his saying, so whoever is afraid of a person in kind or a sin, then he reconciled between them, so he does not sin against him [Al -Baqarah: 182] Rather, what is meant is that there is no sin on it, as it lacks the right of one of the two sides, and it is a disgraceful sin.And the verse indicates the path of the pursuit between Safah and Al -Marwah with the news about them that they are among the rituals of God, so for this, this is the same as the doctrine in the rule of the rule; So the owner of God, may God have mercy on him, went in the most famous of the narrators from him that he was a custody of the pillars of the pilgrimage, and he is the saying of the Shafi’i, Ahmad, and Jamour, The Prophet ﷺ and he turned to it as in the hadith of the two valid and the one who is the one who was repeated between the Sunnah and the satisfaction A verb with the birds of the body from the quarrels of the pilgrimage does not have an exhibitor, and it is measured by the dignity and the wonds of the virginity and the forbidden, with the difference of the knees of the ritual The quarrels of the pilgrimage because it is a prayer, and the difference of the weaving of the stitches, for it is leaving, and by the difference of throwing the gossip, it is a member of a member and it is the hand.And he said that there is no exhibit (P-64) for the exodus of the mud, then it is, even if it is an action with all the body, except that he has an angel, and he is a paradise, and he is a paradise, and he is a paradise.Infidel, and his saying in the hadith: “They will be, for God has written on you [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
