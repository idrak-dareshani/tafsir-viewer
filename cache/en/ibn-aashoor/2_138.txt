The Quranic researcher is the dye of God and whoever is good from God is a dye and we are worshiped for Him.We believed in God and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to the prophets before the faith of God.And the dye of the sacrifice of the origin of its origin is a tin of the mark of the spite of the one, which is the thing that it is dyed with the age of the verb that indicates the meaning Falf.And its connection to the mark of the inheritance to the will of the unit is the same as the inheritance of a peel, a break and a peak.The dyed pigment prepared to be dyed.And he is afflicted by the fact that he is a divorced, and a deputy from his worker, that is, our dye, the dye of God, as he was affected, and the count of God does not succeed God, and he is the one who is the one who says: Al -Aziz, the Most Merciful [Al -Rum: 5] with the ability and their promise to support.Or on that it is a replacement of his saying, the mourning of Abraham, that is, the mortality that God made our slogan like the dye with Juda and the Christians, or a tender and a description of the sacrifice The action of God believed in God and the estimation that believed in the faith of the dye of God, and this is the general face of the launch of the dye on the face The dismantling of the systems is a way that is not packed in the vicious words, because the healing and the context pushes the disintegration, and is the symptoms and the attachments, except for you The conservation and does not affect the disintegration of the suffering, and the owner of the scout made it a follower of his Sibu, a clear source of the condition, like the jelly and the walk, and they made it.The absolute, affirming itself, that is, for something that is his eyes, that is, that the concept of affirming the conquest and the affirmation is defined, so it will be for the sake Obligating to the extent of the number of God, and the promise of God, and the count of God does not succeed God and his promise [Al -Rum: 6] confirming the guarantee of the sentence that is the one who is the one who said: The believers rejoice [Al -Rum: 4].With the support of God, whoever supports those who follow [Al -Rum: 5] in which they are not hidden.And the dye here is a name for the water in which the Jews are seen on the title of the forgiveness of sins and the original in which they have the abandonment in them If he wants to be able to do the kinship (P-743) from the sin of itself or from the people of his house, and the abandonment that the priest sees in the sake of the sake Franks in every year, and the Christians are the origin of the origin of the purification in the river of the Jordanian, and it is the abuse of the Sunnah of the Prophet.Some people with repentance, then if they repent, he will come to him, and he commanded them to be lined up in the river of the two peoples as a symbol of the purification of spiritual That is generalized with a glorious and pure, and long -standing winter in the end of it, and they also say that they are sophisticated with a thousand after the ritual, and it is a word from the language of the language, The Arabs of the Arabs said, and they said that the baptism of the important sign is and the etc.May God be upon him the revelation with the sacrifice and called for the Jews to what God has revealed to him and spoke to the disbelief of Jew And Jesus revived the Jews, the baptism, and Jesus had baptized the dialogue who believed in it, so it was decided in the Sunnah of the Christians, who is in the hands of Qusitnin may baptize the Romans.When he entered the religion of Nazranism, but whoever is born to the Christians, they will baptize him on the four of his birthdays.And the release of the name of the dye on the baptism is to be one of the perpetrators of the Qur’an, and it is possible that the Arabs of the Arabs are called that wash, and it is not the same, and it is not the same.That is one of their words in the ignorance and the appearance of the words of the desire that it is an old launch at the Christians, when he said, and the Christians were born if they were born to them a son who was clouded after the water They claim that this is a dye for them.As for the face of the name of the baptism, it is a hidden, as it is not for the baptism of a collar, so it will be called the staining with it, and in the way of it, and in the way of the one who is the same [p The word is originally from the transit [p It requires that when they were raised, they will be an important eye, a slander, so that it may be for the soil of the material that was dyed with the important eyes in the derivative of what was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the most important The water of the baptism, or on the authority of it, is a building, as it is similar to it, as it imagined that the baptism is the same And he collapsed with her color as the dye collapses a sacrifice, and a closeness of it is the launch of the dye on the usual people and their creation, and they were sought by (P-744) All people who have a dye and a dye are the best of the sacrifice ∗∗∗ Our dye on that is the children Young ponds in which water can claim that it is mixed with the remains of the water that was buried on Jesus when it is baptized, and that what the water is gathered from it and the water in the water It takes the amounts that are considering blessed because they do not deviate from a part of the water that is captured by the sealing of Jesus when he was baptized as he said in the princes of the fox.So the dye of God is a response to Jews and the Christians, with the Jews, because the dye was created in them, and the Christians are because it is a Sunnah, and it is a year.The baptism is a cruel to them for the dominance of the effects of the sensors on their deposits, and they responded to them that the dye of Islam is the one who says the one who says: We believe in God [Al -Baqarah: 136] to his saying and we have Muslims [Al -Baqarah: 136], meaning that if your faith is in the form of the priest, then our faith is in the way of God In the flame with his guidance to it, the launch of the dye on faith is a sense of its similar relationship, and it is a hidden similarity that is good, the intent of the problems, and the problems, and the problems, and the problems, and the problems, and the problems,

forgiven And the name of the problems, but it is the two who are attempted to the preachers of my problems for the memorizers with it.If the intended memorials are mentioned, then the problems are, and we have to describe them as verbal problems such as the saying of Ibn al -Raqqa.؎ They said, put something, we find it for you to cook it ∗∗∗ I said, they cook for me, a meal and a dumper, who is the normalization The memorizer is not mentioned, but rather is known from the context, the name of Qaddadi, such as the saying of my father, Tamam: Whoever does not know that all of them are the same The building is the constructive of the crumbling and the choice, because it was formed by the construction of the house that is estimated in the known words (P-745) from his saying before the house of the house, This tribe and appreciation in the verse is more accurate than the estimation of the house of Abu Tamam, which is based on what is known from the usual of the Christians and the Jews with the saying of his saying: What it includes from baptism.And the understanding is in his saying, and whoever is good from God is an inhuman, and its meaning is not good from God in the matter It is transmitted from a second principle that is estimated after those in his saying, who is good and appreciated, and whoever has the dye is good from God The grammar is mentioned in the converted distinction from the beginning.And this conversion to the distinction may come up with a sake, as two words were deleted with dresses, so when the good deeds were attributed to the one who is permissible to enter the one who is permissible The name of the majesty with added estimation is that that is the manifestation of what was added to it, a dye is the ruler of it with the abandonment of the good, so the one is the knowledge of the The estimated, that is, and who is better than the dye of God.And the sentence and we have worshipers to him, “Aman” and in the validity of the neighbor and the boundary on his work in his saying, “He has worshiped”.They stood up with baptism, but they worshiped the Christ.
