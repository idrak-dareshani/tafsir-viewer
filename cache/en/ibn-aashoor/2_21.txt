The Quranic researcher, O people, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may fear a premature manner that praises the tenderness to the grace of all The advanced remembrance is a preacher, after which he was fulfilled after the right of each of them was fulfilled, and the condition of every partner is a group of him, and he is a group of him.I am satisfied with the conditions of the believers and their consequences from the participants and the hypocrites, there is no crime, the place is prepared for the speech The misguidance, and not (P-324), was what was mentioned by their bad manufactures, without re-re-guiding them and accepting them with speech, so he will be given to them.He threatened them, their lords, and the manufacture of them, to know that the rudeness is for them, is only a cursing of their goodness and that it is rich in them, as the one who does the one who does the one who does the one who does the one who does it He is crushed and sees that the soul of his educator is forced, and his mind is forced with a word to show him that he was offended to him, and he was a love for him, so he did not see it To create it even in the event of their affection and their misfortune, and in the event that they carry them to their reconciliation.After this, the people, and the barrier of the male, the best of the good, and the deceased, and the deceased will be sufficient for them from their bad manners, so they will be taken away from each of them.He preceded his luck from him.What is meant by calling is from his saying, O people, who are not overwhelmed by the preaching of the evil, and that is the majority of the divisions of the Qur’an in the speech with the "O" He said it, do not make it to God, and you know [Al -Baqarah: 22], and the speech opened with the call to intend it.What is a letter of calling, which is the most freedom of the call, as it is the origin of the letters of the call, and therefore it is not appreciated by others when the letters of the call, and the origin of the call, and the origin of it To express the close and distant as in the dictionary.Al -Radhi said: In the explanation of the caffeine: The uses of the proximity and the distant are both, and the claim of metaphor in one of them or the interpretation of the disagreement of the origin.He wants that response to the Zamakhshari, as he said in the scouts: Whatever is a letter and placed in its origin to call the distant, then he is used to call for someone who is unjust, and he is not.A house after after, and he did in the book of the detailed.And what is in the original is a denial that indicates an individual from a name of a name that connects with the way of adding the addition, we go, “meaning a man” or with the way of dispensation, we are the one who is in the man.As your saying to your sitting: I have enough of you, you who are sitting with you, and they may call the calling in the name of his gender or by his descriptions because he is a kind of knowledge To be brought up as here, perhaps the club is coming at that time, then an exclusive or not intended, and maybe they come in the name of the gender or the knowledge With the gender imam, pointing to the way of being destroyed to the sentence of art, then their resignation was running to come at the time of the mother in the name of the name (P-325) and separate the letter of the call and the call that is then in the word “i.E.”, and it is a place that is not running on the measuring of the language, and perhaps it is from the rest of the people.They have seized the name of the sign, so they stayed “here” the Nabariyyah and deleted the name of the sign, so I originally, O people, O, and you will say that they are in your words.The poet who does not know him.This is what you have increased and maybe they wanted to call the present, the self, as well as it indicates the way of bringing it from a state that is based on it by adornment of the same This is in the name of the communication that indicates the state of his connection and the indication of gender because the connector comes to what the mother comes to him, and they will be brought to him The remembrance was revealed to him [Al -Hijr: 6] and the people offer the words in his detection when he said, and from the people [Al -Baqarah: 8] and it is the name of a gathering, and it is here.Every individuals include its name because the crowd defined with the blame for the general public that has not been fulfilled as a covenant as it was decided in the origins, and its introduction is the covenant, as it is the era So, it was in the general one of the generals of the local individual.If you look at the image of the speech, then it is a person who is happy with it, so it is his general for those who did not attend the time to hear this verse and who will be found from the time Advance and the integration of the inclusion of the present, and that is a frequency of transmission and meaning, so it is not a crime that all of them are not needed, and this is not a need for the measure, and that is from the measure.The discourse that is not for aid, and he will be left in which the concerns are left to work for everyone who reconciles the addressee with that, and this is the matter of the rhetoric of the righteous They wrote themselves as they say: O people, and you are a boy, and you see, and with this you know, and the like of that, so what you think of the discourse of the messenger is from the ritual of the messenger, and it is a speech from the For everyone who is included in the memorizer, without seeking another way.This is the realization of the question that the fundamentalists are exposed and express it with the discourse of the scout and the face, is it not.And the gathering, even if they said that it is the ones who are guided without those after them, based on the fact that that is the necessity of the addressee until the member said that the denial of that is an arrogant.And he discussed in it the evangelization, so they said: The fact of judgment is for those who come after them is what is frequent from the workers of the mission, and that its rulings are comprehensive for the creation of the creation in all Bid.(P-326) I said: The phenomenon is that the speeches of legislation and their parts are not running over the known in the face of the speech in the origin of the languages Because the legislator does not mean to a specific partner, as well as the rhetoric of the intertwined and the rulers in the parties and the transmission, the Qur’an is the integrity of the people of the present, and it is clear.It is related to the present, the original synchronization, and its attachment to those who come after after a means of media, media about what is in the matter of what is in the matter Jurisprudence, so we are liked to be the most likely.And worship in the origin of humiliation and subjugation, and the saying was presented in it when he said, the Almighty is worshiped [Al -Fatihah: 5], and when the humiliation and the subjugation were from the truth The one who is faithful to God and his God's devotion was the principle of worship, because those who have been blessed with the one who deserves what is not due to the one who has been lost.The one who addresses the command of the worshipers who are parties from the Arabs and the people of them and the people of the writers and the believers, all of the obligatory worship of the servants, and from the servants of the Creator, and from the Creator, and from the Creator, and from the Creator, With the Messenger, and Islam for the religion and the compliance, because of what it has started to do with all of that, until the end of worship, and if it is in the mights and the perseverance with the lineage, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Includes for the discourse on what was decided in the origins, for the mammary is the opposing destiny until it is not necessary to seek the blessing in its suffering, who is the one who is the one who is the one who comes to me, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not.And if we do not have his father if the context is reconciled to him with a way to separate his saying after that, then do not make God for God [Al -Baqarah: 22] on the saying of God.There is no pilgrimage in this verse for a saying by the discourse of the disbelievers with the branch of the law, because the matter of worship with the lineage to them is the one who is faithful to them, but it is the faith of the faith.The Messenger, and their speech with that is agreed upon, and it is a poisoning question.The saying has passed in the sense of the Lord when he said the Almighty to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Fatihah: 2] in Surah Al -Fatihah.The enemy is directed from the way of adding the addition of the way of the knowledge, as it did not say, worship God, because in the coming of the words of the Lord, the Lord is not permitted With his servants, the developer of the matters of creation is a new servant, because there is the meaning of thanksgiving and the purification of the need.And the individuality of the name of the Lord indicates that the intention is the Lord of all creation, which is God Almighty, as there is no Lord who deserves this name with the individuals and adding to all the people, They shared with God the gods, but some doves were more disturbed by some idols, as the pi-327 (P-327) was more chosen in the same way And the Aws and Al -Khazraj followed them as it will come in the interpretation of his saying, so whoever performs the pilgrimage of the house or is a lumin The significance is on this intention, for it is more short than the communication, so if I want, the other than God, he said: Worship your hearts.So, there is no crime, his saying, worship your Lord, honest that he called to the neutrality of God, and for that, he said that he created you with the increase of the sake Bayan, because the addition of the addition of the meaning of the sake of the sake of worship.And his saying, and those who are before you, benefit the remembrance of the eternity from those who address those who claim that they created them with their fathers, so they said: 24] So his saying and those before you were reminding them that their first fathers would have ended up to the first father, so he is a creature of God Almighty.Perhaps this is the face of affirmation with the increase in a letter from his saying before you, who can seek to disagree with it by restricting it to the one who is in you.The first of the Sufis in the kiss, so its remembrance is here, as it is the origin of its origin with the meaning of the affirmation that prevails over it if it is signed with the “before”.And the creation is the origin of the creation on estimated and equitable, and from it, “The creation of the blood if he gave it to his cutting and cracked it.” The people of the people create, then it does not escape and create creation in the Qur’an and the words of the law on finding the enemies, so it is the release of things from the nursing to the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the exodus, there is no sacrifice.The finding of human beings in their manufactures is things, but it is its visualization with the installation of the separate parts of its parts and the estimation of the merits, such as the sake of the sake of the sake, And the snakes of the merits and their types and the generation of some of them from what was called the divine creation in it from the system of finding, such as the formation of the boundaries in the time of the time, and the formation of the fetus in the time of the time in the time of the time, And the formation of the agriculture in the love of the cultivation, and the formation of water in the withdrawals, so all of it is created, and it is one of the formation of God, and there is no lesson.Like marriage and the meeting of love and nuclei in the earth for germination, for the creation that is the later from the numbers to the existence of the obesity of the human work (P-328) was special in the name of the creation in the name The memorization of creation is the closest to the Arabic language, indicating the meaning of finding from the number that is the attribute of God Almighty, and that is the meaning of the substance So, he was given his launch in the tongue of Islam with God, the highest of those who create as someone who does not create, do you not remember [Al -Nahl: 17] and he said: “Who is the one who is unaware of God: 3] So it is not called otherwise, and if it was released by one other than God, they are based on building a linguistic truth, then his release was made.Al -Ghazali said in the intention The Sunnah: There is no luck for the servant in his name to the Head of the Creator, except by the face of the metaphor after a long time He was not preceded by her and appreciated with that on her action, it was like the one who was chosen because he had no existence before it, so it is permissible to release the name of the name.So he made the permissibility of the reaction of creation on the sacrifice of some worshipers, in this manner, and with that, he made it a metaphor, so he said, so what is the one who said it, so what is the one who said it.Jesus, peace be upon him, that I create for you from the clay as the goodness The bird with my permission [Al -Ma’idah: 110].Then he specializes in that material with the formation of God, the exalted of the glories.For the matter of worship, then I was separated by his worshipers, so that you may fear you.Perhaps a letter indicates hope.And the hope is the news of the abandonment of an affairs in the future and a certain fell.It shows that a letter of its significance is an expert because it is a news about the confirmation of the thing of the thing and its meaning is compounded by the hope of the speaker in the address My letter, and it has been popular with those who are immoral and the people who are confused in the bearer of the words of the words of God, may God bless you When the speaker, the doubt is a side in its costume until Al-Jawhari said that P-329 (P-329) said, and this is not appropriate for the knowledge of God, and the people of God, and the people of God.I was returned in a news with the numbers of the arrival of the one who said it, and it was taken for us.They did not remember as the verses have shown him after.And for them in the interpretation of the perhaps in the words of God, the Almighty is a face: one of them said Sibuyeh, so that he may be at its door and the translation, or the signature, but it is in the way of the addressees.It means that it is for the news that the addressee is a release, and his choice is satisfied, saying: It is that the origin is that it does not come out of its costume.And I say: It does not mean that it means that this is the meaning of it, but it means that it is a metaphor for the meaning of the truth of the struggle of the sacrifice in the same way Rajaa requires a hope and a manifestation of it, so the righteousness is indicative of the meaning of the act of hope, except that it is a partial meaning, and each of the actor and the verb is the one With commitment, then A consolidation indicated the connotation of the risk of hope for the perpetrator of hope, and it was not in the letters or the verb is accompanied by it The mentality, and so if the deserted verb does not obtain.The second is that perhaps for the sake of the sake of the intention: Perhaps you will be seduced by you.And aspiration is also a metaphor of hope, because the hope is obligated by the approach, and the proximity is obligatory, so the conscience is necessary.Thirdly, it is to explain in the sense of Ka, said by Qartb and Abu Ali al -Farisi and Ibn al -Anbari; And I count that their intention is this meaning in the places that do not appear in the sense of hope, so they do not respond to them that he does not want to say that he says: 17] To the authenticity of the meaning of hope for the one for the addressee.And it is not mentioned to them, too, that it is a proof of meaning in (perhaps) that there is no witness from the words of the Arab Because it is a greed from a generous, if he is reassured, he said, “Whoever said: May God be in the sense of it, so that it is the meaning of a metaphor that arises from the reward of one who is a reward, so it is the reward of the Marab.Its attained is what the owner of the scouts went to that it is a boss, and he said: Perhaps there is a satellite in the verse, the satellite of the metaphor, because God Almighty created his servants to worship them, and he will worship them The choice and wanted them to be good (P-330) and piety, so he understood in the image of those who are left of them to fear for their affairs to be performed, and they are the ones who are among the obedience and the disobedience as you are asking, as is the case.Ben to do and not do.And his friend, his saying, is up to you, for you, which is the best work [Hood: 7] Rather, it is praised and the one who is hidden from him is hidden from him.The words of the scouts make it to be in his words, the highest, analogy, because it made it like it, a compound form of the person who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a good and the murid The hope and the one who is required of it, and the hope, so that the compound is made for the purpose of the meaning of the compound indicating the will.And I have another impeding face, which is that perhaps the location is in the place of an affairs or forbidding it, so that it is a resignation that will be seized, so that the one is in the words of the words of the words in the words of the words in the words of the words in the words Or without it, then if you say: I miss so and so that you would advise him, he was a brother with the expatriateness of the occurrence of something, and that it is possible that it is possible for it to be suspended.The reward of the one who speaks to the crops, so this is the meaning of the obligatory commitment, it may be known to be infected with the Qur'an It did not fall or not fall into The future is the Qur'an on the fact that this is the synonym without needing to be interpreted in the sense of hope that it benefits it so that it may be that it is a metaphor or a metaphor for it.It comes with it because the place requires the meaning of hope, as the commitment is to be interpreted by this significance in every place in the Qur’an, it is given to the meaning of the hope that is required They resorted to interpretation because they looked at the perception of a definitive look at the arms of its use in a dispute that the one who has been inspired is to be brought up to it.And on all, it is meaning that it is not the meaning of the actions of the approach.And piety is the warning of what he is denying, and it is popular with the Arabs and those who are in their causes, and it is the obtaining of the attributes of the blasphemy that the debt collects, and the saying may be presented in it.Hands is a guidance for the righteous [Al -Baqarah: 2] And when the piety was the result of worship, its hope was made by the matter of worship.And it is presented with his saying, Haddah, for those who are righteous [Al -Baqarah: 2] The meaning worship your Lord, please fear, and you will be fully eager, and they are the one who is eager, and they are the one who is eager.The worship is a way to obtain it with the worship of worship and the worship of the games or the will of creation and formation and the sacrifice of the good.
