the good news, except that his saying does not come out of his eloquence, because his eloquence is from the authority of the It is prevented from making it strange.As for his being, contrary to the measure, it is not forbidden to seek it except by the lineage to the birth if he wants to measure it in another material.(P-687) The owner of the scouts went to the fact that the bodies of here is a similar characteristic taken from the bid of the significance of the significance, that is, the creativity is a self-attribute to it with the lord of the lord of It is one of its creatures, so it was added to its true actor on its heroic, and it is similar to the effective of it, and the row was performed on the name of the majesty, so that it may be the same Nahwah: Zoudah is good face as it is said: so that the poetry of poetry, that is, a bid of his heavens.As for Amr's house, they appointed him to theorizing, and they did not allow it to have the advantage of being the hearing in the

are.There is nothing of those people of people, because it is for him to be a son, but all among them are the servants of God Almighty as it was presented in his saying, but for him, but for him, but

revelation of the similarity of the Christians, and he will be rented that he does not take a son, but he will be taken.One, and all of them are subject to his formation, and that is that the
