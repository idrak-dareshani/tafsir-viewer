The Quranic researcher (P-254) God has sealed their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes, this sentence is a neighbor, the course You have to warn them, or did you not warn them, and they will not believe [Al -Baqarah: 6] and for his causes in the event to be paid for that, you like the wonder of the sins and the sins of the one who wonders with the sins of the one who wonders with the sins of the sins and the sins of the one who wonders with the sins of the sins and the sins of the one who wonders with the sins of the one who is the ones The influence of faith to their souls with the clarity of its evidence, then if it is aware that their hearts are sealed and on their hearing and that they are on their eyes, and that they are in their eyes.And the hero of the wonder, for the sentence is a bias that benefit a liquid answer that asks about the reason for their being, they are not believed, and the fall of this sentence in the word Those are on the authority of their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 5].The seal is the truth of the dam on the vessel and the lock on the book with a clay and the like with the placement of a mark that is established in a conclusion to prevent that from the time of the time His friend is that he opened a corruption that appears in the impact of the engraving and the prophet was taken ﷺ a conclusion of that, and the Arabs were sealing on the bottles of the wine, to the sake About her and greet the dirt in the period of her exclusion.As for the name of the idiot, the last thing is a seal, because that is the place, or that time is the custody The conclusion is to open the clay, which is placed on the sealed place.The pattern was engraved ﷺ Muhammad, the Messenger of God.The mud of the seal is a special clay that resembles the mountains.A young woman every piece with a chewing custody, and they made him the ends of the seller of the people of the dhimma.Covering is effective from its mereness and its mereness if it is his veil, and what is formulated for him and the adultery of a verb with the breaking of the fulfillment of the meaning of the insult to something like the turbine, the dug.It was said that the formulation of this adultery for industries, such as the seat, because of the meaning of the metaphor of the metaphor, and the meaning of covering the cover.The circumcision is not on the hearts and the listening, and the murmur on the sight here is a truth, as it was deluded with some of the beneficiaries, as it was transferred by the son of the one who is the one who is a neighbor.He made their hearts, that is, their minds in the number of influences of faith and truth (P-255) and the guidance to them, and make their hearing in its congestion from the hearing of the verses and the vow, and made it in What you see from the miracles and the olive indicators, as if it is a seal on it and a deceitful without it.The interest of the slogan by similating it is the same The authenticity, and they are entitled to a realistic, but the likeness is a mind, not a sense.And to make the seal and fraud to similar to an imperfection, imagined in their hearts, that is, their awareness of the silence of the name and the name of the disbelief and the name Evidence - as it was presented - with the sealing of the seal, and an imagined form in their eyesight from the numbers of contemplation in Al -Haddani and the ritual of the ritual You like the mind, and you are to make the seal and fraud a metaphor sent to the relationship of the necessity and what is meant by the necessity of this, and it is not true, and it is not.The terminology of the law is a delusion in the soul of the lost or the creation of the delusional, and the same is the pride and the one.And it is clear that his saying and their hearing is given to his words, so their hearts will be, so the hearing will be a seal on it, and it is not a good news.And on their eyes, it is given to it, because the mechanism is appropriate for the sight, not the reputation, and that the seal is appropriate for the reputation, as it is appropriate for the hearts, as they are both of them, and it is like it.The closing and the dam, for the Arabs say: I have heard it, and it was heard of its hearing and made their shock in their ears.And what is meant by hearts is here the doors and the minds, and the Arabs are called the heart on the grace of the Sunnah On the basis of the human being and that is the majority of their words on the animal, which is what is meant here, and the headquarters of the brain is not a place, but the heart is the one who extends it with the power of the one who does it.Rather, he was heard and did not collect as they collected their hearts and their eyes, either because he wants the source that indicates the gender, as it is not called the ears that he is not called the ears that he is not.The ears in his saying make their shock in their ears [Al -Baqarah: 19] and his saying and in our ears and a cows [Chapter: 5] So when he crossed with hearing, he was unique because he is a source The hearts are numerous and the vision is the collection of Basr, which is a name that is not a source, or to estimate the deleted, that is, and on the obsessive of their hearing or (P-256).It may be in the hearing of a gentle, horrific, from the rhetoric of the Qur’an, is that the hearts were varying and their dedication to thinking about the matter of faith and the religion of faith.Evidence, and the many and the few, and you receive many types of verses, for every mind of his luck, and the vision was also a virginity of the consequences of the consequence Humanism in the horizons, and in the soul in which there is a sign, for every sight Its luck from the fools to the miraculous verses, the lessons and the sermons, when the types of what they attached to it were disturbed.As for the reputation, it was related to the hearing of the Qur’an, so if they hear the Qur’an, they heard it as equal, but it is avoided in the man The minds, when he limited them to the hearing, was made one hearing.And the release of the names of the wounds and the parts if the metaphor wants it for its work and its exports, it is permissible to perform it on the other hand And he was not correct, the Al -Jahiz said in Al -Bayyan.And in the scouts that they say that if the confusion believes as the saying of the poet: Eat some of your stomach It is what he is like, as it was preserved with the whole of the words of it, so your hearts are listened What is the promise of the note on the one who said that the same is the one who said the second suffering, so he carried his words on the mistake of the ignorance of the Arab A gentle intention with a rhetoric with the difference of what is in the house, as a virtue of the verse as a saying to me - may God be pleased with him - for whom he asked him when he passed away.The actor said to him: (God) because he knew that he had sinned, he wanted to say: the dead, otherwise it is true that it is said that it is died, so that it is the same He was satisfied with his sake, and his soul has read his saying, and those who die of you [Al -Baqarah: 234] in the form of the building for the reaction.After the time of the seal, it is metaphor in the vastness of the influence of the right to their minds and their reputation, and the universe of that is due The description of God is the Almighty because it is estimated for him on the chain of transmission (P-257), as well as this description other than the Qur’an from the Qur’an.God is printed on their hearts [Al -Nahl: 108] and his saying, and do not obey those who forgive us of his heart from our remembrance [Al -Kahf: 28] and we do not have many in the Qur’an from the Qur’an.And its carriers of us to investigate that it is a response to the advertisement that every person is the destiny of God Almighty and that God is guided and worse This is contrary to the roses of the verse and its organizations in the sense of the appointment on the Sufis of that and the disgrace in their condition, because that by administering what they have, and the one who has the same The ability to act and leave, which is without creation, for God Almighty has destroyed the evil and found in The people are able to do it, but it is forbidden for them because it was found in the people who are able to leave it as well, so do not oppose between the destiny and the abuse, as it is the same The destruction of the destiny, and they turned the destiny, which is appreciation and knowledge, and the difference of what the disgraceful one of the abundance of God is the Almighty, and it is not the Almighty.He is a creature for him, but the creature has their own self and their actions, so that they can be given to the denial of the validity of the chain of transmission of the same as the verb of the verbs of God.Corruption, and the interpretation of what was mentioned in that: that this is not a thing of them because they said that they say that he may be exalted that they will do it while they are able to do so on That capacity is a greeting to the verb of the ugly, and it is a tribute, so the verification is what the Ash'ari gave to and others from the people of the Sunnah that God is the ability The servant is not from God, and he is the one who is more correct about the imam of the two sacred and his harmful ones.And it is not mentioned to us that it is how to be able to do with the actions of sins?Because he is returned to the dismissed, too, that he knew after that I am able to do so that they are hurry in tin By investigating and running on the way of gathering between what the book and the Sunnah were exhausted from the evidence.We have a higher investigation than this, in which we are in the mission of ability and estimation that appears.And the chain of transmission of the seal is metaphorical to God Almighty for the significance of the meaning of the seal of their hearts, and that his disappearance is not included as it is said to be in a man, and the creation is in Falah, So, so that it was given, and he was separated from this chain of transmission and between the chain of transmission in the mind of the mind, because this is what I want from it to be the meaning and the mental metaphor, but it is not the same He deed for a dress, and the dominant is the validity of the administering, as it reconciled to one of them, but it is committed to what is reconciled with the place.(P-258) and a sentence and on their hearing a kind of his saying and their hearts by returning the neighbor to the increase in affirmation until the gossip will be a matter With the comment, as if he had seen two times.And it is a note as the being of the reputation, which is intended to be sealed, as it is not like the permissibility.And his saying, and on their hearing, does not tell the fraud because the reputation does not cause it to be fragmented, but it is caused by the dam not to see it to the saying of the exalted And he made his eyes a mesmerization [Al -Jathiya: 23] and that he said his saying and on their eyes a sign of that it is the news because the adherence was to be corrected by His saying and their hearing is the news to seek to be able to present one of them and the other is the most origin They heard themselves and on their eyes.And in the presentation of the hearing on the sight in its places from the Qur’an, it is evidence that it is more beneficial to its owner from the eyesight, so the permission is permissible.Because the hearing is a machine to receive the knowledge that the mind of the mind, which is a means of the rhetoric of the call of the prophet to the understanding of the nations on the face of the one who is in the authority Hearing, and because the hearing returns to it the sounds that are listened to the sixties, with the face of the face, with the difference of sight, it needs to be directed to the face.* * * They have a great torment of torment: pain.It was said that his origin is the torment of the source of torment if he removes the torment because the torment removes the sweetness With a notice of freshness of freshness, as the fate of the word is not necessary to its counterpart in the forest.And the description of the torment with the great is an indicative of the torment of the one who is a torment, and that is to be fulfilled by the prescription for its greatness, because the denial, even if it is righteous, is good It is not a text in it and it is not permissible to be a great affirmation of what is beneficial to the denial of the greatest, as the owner of the key thinks because the connotation of the conquest Performing, and signs other than the subjugation, seeking to seek refrain from it if it is mentioned what is indicated by it, so it is not considered to be sure.And the torment in the verse is either the torment of fire in the hereafter, or the torment of killing and desired in the world.
