The researcher, the Qur’an, is that I know what you are promising, or make my Lord a prince of the unseen, so he does not appear on his absence, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger, for he is a mess.Reduce to know that they had canceled the messages of their Lord [Al -Jin: 28] The participants were many to ask the Messenger of God ﷺ when this promise, and from the time And the relative of that was repeated to them in the Qur’an, so when God Almighty said, even if they saw what they promised, then they will know whoever weakens a supporter [the jinn: 24] They used to say from the question about the time of the endeavor, so God commanded his Messenger ﷺ to restore them from his answer.(P-247) The sentence, say if I know what you are promising, you will be a bi-bent.Because the one who is commanded to say that it is a answer to their question.And the end: the end and its origin in the place.And from the saying of Ibn Omar in the hadith of the two of the two: “The Messenger of God ﷺ preceded between the horses that were not included and made it the enemy of the obedience.” The term is naughty for a period of time, a certainty said, and the height of them has been involved.[Al -Hadid: 16], and it is also here.And his interview with (closeness) benefits that the meaning or makes him a long time.And the sentence of the unseen world, so it does not appear on its absence in the position of the cause for a sentence, if I know that you will not be promised.And the scientist of the unseen: a beginner, deleted, that is: he is the scientist of the unseen, and the omitted guarantee is a good to my Lord.This deletion from the way of the chain of transmission to it is a reflection in which the recipient is followed if the words were, he was a deducted on the remembrance of the chain of transmission to him and his descriptions of the same The key.And the absence: the source of the absentee, if it is hidden and hidden from the eyes, and its definition is the purity of the spectrum.And adding a characteristic of a world to the absence, it benefits the knowledge of all the absent truths, whether it was what are the things or individuals, so the meaning of the export is included for the absence of the absence of the same The afflicted things are included in the same way as angels and heaven.The unseen self from the knowledge of people is like the future of the future, which is informed of it or the one who is not informed of it, so the excitement of the source here; Because he is a detention of the knowledge of God with all of that.And that was presented when he said the Almighty who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3] in Surah Al -Qar.And the definition of the chain of transmission with the definition of the chain of transmission to the estimated, it benefits the palace, meaning: it is the scholar of the unseen, not me.And it was made in the sense of the summary of God to the knowledge of the unseen, so it does not appear on its absence, so the fulfillment of the ruling on the rule of the ruling, and the rule of the ruling, And detailing the extent of the number of viewing on its absence.And the meaning does not appear on its absence: it is not listened to and is not predicted by it, and it is stronger From (P-248) (Cross); Because (appears) came from the appearance, which is the scene, and to include it meaning: it is loyal, enemy with a letter (Ali).And the fact of the verb in the matter of negation benefits the general, and so is the occurrence of its effective, and it is a denial in its bias that benefit the general.And he (Ali) is a consumed in the ability to see the absence, and it is like the Almighty saying, and God appeared on him [the prohibition: 3], so it is a metaphor.And I am excluded from this negation of those who have been brought to him to call him some of the unseen, that is: on a unseen, he wanted to show it from the shhi, for it is the absence of God His Messenger ﷺ from a news about what will happen, or a briefing on the guerrillas of some people.He said that he was satisfied: And appreciation: unless someone brought it out, that is: his choice to see something from the absence of a ruling that God Almighty wanted.And the coming of the continuity and the prayer in its saying, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger to intend what the prayer is given from the gesture to the analogy What God wanted from the message to the people, so he knows from this faith that the absence that God is permitted by the messenge They imitate him or do it, and what he has related to that of the promise and the boundaries of the last things Like the Almighty, the Romans dominated the lowest land, and they are after their victory, and they will be overpowered in a place of two years [Al -Rum: 2].What is meant by this achieved knowledge is the knowledge of the knowledge of the view.The verse does not include what the righteous may get from the explanation of the sincere vision, in the hadith (“The righteous vision is from the righteous man from the part of the righteous man Forty part of the prophethood, or with the delusion.Narrated by a Muslim.Muslim said: Ibn Wahb said: Tefir (spokesperson): they are inspired.Malik has said in the good vision: It is easy and not jealous, he wants because it may make mistakes in its interpretation.(P-249) and from a messenger of the pipe (who) of the connection, so he indicated that (who) is a group of the messengers, that is: except the messengers who are present, that is.(A messenger) included every messenger from God Almighty, and the angels who are sent to the messengers are included in the etiology of a neighborhood of them like Jabril - peace be upon him -.The messengers were included from the people who are sent to the people by informing the command of God, the Almighty to them from a project or other than what their goodness.Here, four guarantees are an abnormal: The second is the strained person in (Yuslk), which is not the case Upon God Almighty, as he returned to him, a guerrilla (he is).And the third and the four are a guarantee of his hands and from his successor, and they are returned to (a messenger), meaning: God asks you, that is: he sends to the Messenger from the one who is from the Messenger of the Messenger Its walls are monitored, that is: an angel who memorizes the Messenger ﷺ from the meeting of the demons to what he mixes with what God has brought to him from his absence.And the king is his truth: the inhale as it is in its saying, as well as its wealth in the hearts of the criminals [Al -Hijr: 12] in the wall of the stone.And the king is released on the preaching, similar to it to the income in the thing, in which there is no way to him, as it is presented in the words of it.His Lord, we ask him to be a difficult torment [Al -Jin: 17]) That is: He sends to him an angel, who is directed to him, and they do not return The likelihood of their connection to it and their guns was similar to it in the part of the body.This is from the sentence of the preservation that God has preserved with his remembrance in his saying that we are reminding us of the remembrance, and we have the preservatives [Al -Hijr: 9].What is meant by between his hands and from his succession is from all the flaws, and from that kinetah he moves to a sequence that is from peace and abstaining.(P-250) and the monotheism: the name of a group as it was presented in its saying, it finds it a meteor of observation [Al-Jinn: 9].He (monitored) was erected that he was effective with it for the verb (heal).And he comments (to know) with his saying (he asks you), meaning: God does that to inform the unseen to the Messenger as he sent to him, and he does not mix with him.So God knows that the messengers have eliminated what was revealed to them as he sent it without change, so when God's knowledge was to redeem the Messenger of the Messenger, the Messenger of the Survon The revelation as God revealed, made the cause of the cause and evaluated the place of the cause as a summary of the words; Because the knowledge of God with that will only be on the authority of what happened, and this is like the saying of Iyas ibn Qubaiya: ؎ I accepted and the sin is among us from the knowledge of it To appear who is a courage and who is a cheese, I know that.This reason is the most intense intensity of those who are satisfied with a messenger on the absence, and the remembrance of this cause does not require the confinement of the reason for it.He came with the guarantor of the individuals in his saying from his hands and from his successor, taking into account the memorial (a messenger), then he came to him with the guarantor of the group in the saying of his saying that [28] The meaning of a messenger, which is the spectrum, that is: the messengers on the way of the saying of the righteous, a nose, because he has the fire of hell, ever in it [Al -Jin: 23].And what is meant: Let God know that they have informed the messages of God and performed the safety of the knowledge that their reward arises.It was understood from his saying that they have informed the messages of their Lord [Jinn: 28] that the updated absence About him in this verse is the absence related to the legitimacy and its origins from the resurrection and part,; Because the words that are excluded from it is the negation of the science of the Messenger ﷺ by the approach of what they promise to or after it, and that is from the horror of the penalty and the mission.And it is attached to it what is inspired by the prophets who are not messengers; Because what is revealed to them is not free from being a support for a precedent law like the sons of the children Adam and Ayoub.And he knew that the discretion is from the negation, it is not necessary for all the exhibitions (P-251) the conditions of the ruling that is not the one who is not.It is like the contradiction in the correspondence, obtained by partials from the parties of what the forbidden words have denied, and it is not the saying of the Almighty except for those who are satisfied He is informed of all the absences of God, and the one who is informed of it was revealed to him to know that they have informed the messages of their Lord [28].And Rawiyeh read, on the authority of Yaqoub (to know) by the light of ya and the opening of the lam is based on the act of the one who was the one who has been overwhelmed by the jinn: the jinn: 28] To know about it, that is: God knows that they have been canceled.
