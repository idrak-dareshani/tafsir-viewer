The Quranic researcher, these are guided by their Lord, the name of the reference, who is directed to the righteous who were made from the attributes of what was presented, so they were two.The origin of the sign is to return to a certain view, except that the Arabs may come out with it from the original, and it will return to a self -evaluated one of the words after it is mentioned and what is reminded of it.It is descended by the homes of the present in the speaking and the poisonous, for if the fullness is aware of those attributes and it is important or strange in the best or against it, it is like it.The speaker is based on that, and he shall refer to it as the present, the witness, so that the indication comes to the indication that he does not clarify in his dialect, and there is no richest in the view of the one who is the one who is the one who is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the view of the view So the sign is sufficient for it, this is the origin of the recovery in the reference of the sign after the remembrance of the adjectives with the presence of the presence of the referred to it.Then they may follow the name of the indicated reference after those descriptions with judgments, so this indicates that the origin of these rulings is that of those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the name It was the way of the briefing, the reference was for the people of those attributes, standing in the place of the selves referred to.As the rulings are after the names of the souls, they benefit that they are steadfast for the heavens, so the rulings that are mentioned after what are for the adjectives are the same as that it is the same, so it is clear that it is clear.Those who are guided by their Lord in a house to say: Those of those descriptions are the reason for their ability to guide their Lord to them.And his counterpart is the saying of the goodness of the good: to God, they are upset, and it is eliminated and spent on the events and the forefathers of the time.Maghana (P-242) until he said: ∗∗∗ So that if he wiped out, then his praise is good.A fantasy noseid, because if the smile hears what the attributes of praise be presented to them, they will be monitored for those whose descriptions, and the name of the sign is here Their guarantee, and the indication is better than it, because it includes all the advanced designs, so it was achieved by the imbalance in the chapter of the chapter, the one who is the one That the navigator is the remembrance of the name of the reference, the most exhaustion that is the restoration of the name of the assignment of it.This estimation is the same as the meaning, and the most prominent of the name of the reference in the same way as its summons, because it appears in the shadow of the sign of the point The adjectives referred to it and what he wants after the name of the reference from the ruling that is arising from it, and this is only obtained by making the name of the sign a start to the first one.Those said to him on this guidance from their Lord, due to the news that the Qur’an is guided to them, and the two rituals are guided.The form of their enabled the guidance and their steadfastness, and their attempt to increase it with it and the traffic in the way of the goodness of the righteous in the righteousness of the righteous and the righteousness of the righteous And the ability to its lands, so they likened their condition that are extracted from the number of that of the extreme situation that is extracted from the number of those who are similar to it, as it is the same.The use of the most powerful types that can be able to do anything, and the face of our authority is authorized by the appreciation They are preceded by their understandings at the hearing of what indicates the recovery.With the likeness of it or the symbolism of what they remember except the ride and its upperness, and they say, make the end of the passion, and the ignorance of the ignorance, and the absence of the abode, and the absence of the place, and the absence of the abode, and the absence of the place of the abode, and it is not In Al -Amal, he installed a blind person.She fell into a clash.The jungle said, “Amer Bin Al -Tafil Al -Ghanawi,” said: If you are a domesticated, he said, ignorant that the stretching of the youth is the youth, so you will be the word of Ali.The body that is likened to the face of the brevity (P-243) and its origin is the first of the guidance of the guidance.All of it.Thus, the words of the scouts decided in it, explaining it, the good, the conqueror, the evangelist, and the oval.Al -Qazwini went in the revelation and the Jerjan, that the urbanization in the verse is a restriction that is restricted by the likeness of the seizure of the guidance with the righteousness of the one who is the one who is the one For the knees, and the suspicion will be seen to the meaning of the letters while he is on the master, and the master has passed a third face, which is that here is a place that is unable The recovery is a century on that on the way of the silence in the response of the pioneering to the place.Then, the good and the evangelist increased, so they made in the verse a sense with the representative, saying that the coming of a word is based on it that it is to be with its own.You are able to be a metaphor, not a condition.The Saad of the Evangelical Religion was fired for the direction of the representative, and the Jerjan Master was victorious.And the master was accustomed to the denials of her as an inaugural, and he saw it as a group between those who are opponents, because each of the two ways of similarity from the affairs of the Summary, how is the meaning of the letter from the individual suffering, such as the recovery here; If the suspicion is considered here, it is necessary that it is not the meaning of it and the attachment of its meaning, similar to it, nor the arrogant from it, no follower, no, and the righteousness, and it is in it.And his entourage on him The long as the happiness has prolonged in the footnote of the scouts and in the long, and they were tired of the sharp arrows.We enter into the government between these two flags that there is no conflict between all of the whole that in the verse, it is similar to things to the things of the sentence of the one who has the same It is proven that it is not possible that the two parties are in the appointment of the way that it has with this similarity, so the most of them make it to make it.It is similar to those things that have the possession and installation of a lion, and the master makes it the way of the mourning that the analogy and the analogy are the same The science will obtain the rest of these things by the discipline of the similar individuals and the likeness of it, and the way of the representative and the way of the place is permissible.So the view here will be paid to any of the two ways, I am more likely to be adopted and fulfilled in the rhetoric, and that the collection is among the two ways of al -Takleh and al -Ma’idah in The construction of the Bians as the master claimed it.It was decided in the knowledge of the Bayan that his family is more disgusting on the advertisement that the body likelizes, so they do not refrain from it to the individual (P-244), and what is the right of it, and it is the right of it.The miracle when the remembrance of the house of Bashar: as if the shift is on the authority of the heads of our heads, we are not hateful, the intention of the purpose The majestic, its crying, do not like the night on the night, and the siouf with the makers from one side, and for that, the ruling is obligatory that our swords are in the ruling of the ruling on the ruling of the ruling It is separated in his similarity, because the pour of the swords is that the waw in the sense of not on kindness.If this is decided, it is clear to your religion that the analogy of the analogy has the sufficient luck when the people of the rhetoric and its face is that one of the most important purposes of the abolition is the first and the first of it, and it is the first of it.It was doubted that the representation is more important to the likeness of the likeness because it is an adulterer with a bone, so it falls into the spontaneity and the most evident of the suffering.And we find the advertisement of the representative in the verse, I am more likely because it is clear, the most beautiful, the most famous, and the happiness of the words of the scouts, but the clarification of it, so it is clear that it is clear.A clear clearer, in which there is no cost in it, so that the group of people who are risked in their equivalent to the guidance of the ritual is the same, etc., etc.The ability to be able to seek to be able to use it, and then it is beneficial to that of piety.As for her, it is notified, because the shrine was not allowed to be the administs with the agreement of the two parties, and it was not a crime, and they were not in the abundance of what is in which the most powerful and most powerful.As for its most famous, it is that the representative is agreed upon by the disagreement of the pursuit.As for his being, he is happy with the words of the scouts His saying “like that he wanted to be in acting, because the words of his example are among the people of this industry that does not come out in it.The linguist.If it is true that the representative is more likely, let us move the words to corrected the collection between it and between al -Tu'aiyyah, which is the second field of disagreement between the one and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one between it The convergence of the consequences is permissible with the representative in the verse and the master, which prevents that as you have learned and say if the likeness is from the one who is a darkening, then the one who is very diligent is the one In the likeness of the part of the likeness to it, which is the meaning of the installation, how is it a matter of some like the likeness of it, which is borrowed for some likeness, and it will be invalid.This indication is the view of the saying of the imams of the rhetoric, if the origin of the paradigm of the compound is that it is used in its facts, but the metaphor in the path of the one in the case, but the metaphor in the Received the likeness of the likeness, as the words of the master are eloquences at her.But the evangelization did not see what is forbidden from the conversion of the metaphor in some of the uniqueness of the compound, if it is not in it, and perhaps it is seen in this This is the verse, and it is not the case that the situation requires from the properties, and this (P-245) did not fulfill the rhetoric, as it was decided in the search, The miracle is the highest part of the universal rhetoric of the anxes of the properties, as it was indicated in its position, which is the choice, so when it was found in the similar and similar body, it is the same Because one of them is likened to the other, which is similar to it, and it is not within the similarity of the body, the right of this place was the right to be able to be able to do it, and it is the right to the right To him with a word on me, and otherwise, these are two parts of the two of the two The one who is excluded with the privileges of the passive, nor the guidance with the ride, so it will be “on” this point of some of the accompanying metaphors, as an indication of it, with the abundance of it.And whoever chooses it in this verse is that the saying of the highest of these is a dedicated, analogical, analogy, like the state, the case, and the case of the case, and the case of it The riding on the ride is as if it is said that the rides of the guidance are said, and the best of what indicates the likeness is that it is the first and the guidance, and a symbol of the richness of the same is the same To memorize “the indication of the ritual, as you knew, so we will complete us in the sections of the representative, the three sections: the slogan, as in the rule of the paradise.The representation is a metaphor for it, as it is the use of the news in the evacuation, and it is an explicit boss, we see you, you offer a man and the last one.And from it a place as it is in the verse on our opinion, and it is a goodness as it is in the saying of Al -Hamasi: and Faris in the Gammar of the death is a minor, if it is shining on the righteousness of it.A representative of the causes of the causes of death from it from every side in the form of those who surrounded the wading water from every side and the memorial of a mine.Rather, we are disturbed and not known to the equality of the equality of definition and disobedience here, if it was known that the definition would be the end of the gender, so it is the most likely By that he is from their Lord, it is a stimulant for the precedent in his saying that is a guidance for the righteous [Al -Baqarah: 2], with the absence And they are affiliated with the benefit of the guidance of the guidance of the peer of the praise and the remembrance of what indicates the ability to be able to be able to So he said from their Lord, he intended to do this guidance, which requires his glorification, and all of that goes back to the greatness of the descriptions of the possibility of it.Rather, the guidance was described as one of their Lord to intend for that guidance and honor him with the sign that they are with the place of care from God, and so is the addition of the Lord to the addition Added to the sins.* * * (P-246) and those are the ones who rejected the reference of the second reference to the eye of the first reference With the acquisition and the intensity, do not mention one of them for the last, but rather it is specially related Both sayings.And the face of kindness in the wow without the chapter, that between the two sentences is a mediator between the money of communication and the severity, because if you looked at the disagreement of their disagreement The concept of them, which is the guidance, is in the world and the other concept, which is the farmer, has the last two.And if you look at the concept of one of them from the other concept, and each of them is intended by the descriptions, it was two connections, so the connection was like And the feud is a home, which is the home of the intermediate, such as the Shurah Shourah decided that the condition of the mediator decided that the compassion is as it is the same as the kindness of the And he is aware of me that when the requirements are opposed to the convergence, because it is the highest in the remembrance of the camel after each other.And they are the ones who are the righteous for the separation, and the definition of the people of the Sans, which is the appearance, is that there is no grace here, according to the appearance of the situation These are wearing, and the definition of the chain of transmission with the bond of gender if he is carried on a chain of transmission to a definition, so the sealing benefits, so the guarantee of the chapter is for the sake of the chapter, Emphasizing the sealing.But if the definition of the Persians, which is the back, is the definition of the chain of transmission To him with the chain of transmission from the matter of the testimony of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a matter of the good, is a thing that is not.Al -Taraif is without denying, and this is represented by Abd al -Qahir with their saying: It is the heroic hero, that is, if you hear the heroic hero and degraded it, then it is so.And to him he pointed out in the scouts here by saying it or on the authority of those who are the righteousness of the two successors and achieve what they are and perceived with the images The two Sheikhs did not follow this, so he adjusted it in the key, and God has his dome.“ And the verb from it is that it has become a peasant, but it is derived from the verb by the medium of the hamor that indicates the goodness because it does not fall into the event of the same, but it is the same, but it is the same, but it is the same, but it is the same.With whom I was destined to: He said in the scout: See how God has gone out of God, and the alerts have been exalted on the choice And its confusion and the definition of (the successors), and the cultivation of the chapter between it and between those of those to see you, and they will see you in order To present what they came.
