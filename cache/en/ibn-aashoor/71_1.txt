The Quranic researcher, we sent Noah to his people to warn your people before before that a passion for them to come to them.Pinch of a doubt about a hesitant in this speech.Many of the conquest of the first words of the Arabs open to the knowledge of the confirmation of this exhibition and maybe they made (that) within the guarantee of the guarantor of the one who is the one who said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.And the remembrance of Noah - peace be upon him - went on in Surah Al -Amran.It was presented that this name is not Arab, and that it is not derived from the nucleus material.And to warn your people to the end of it is the guarantee of what Noah was sent to his people, so (that) is interpretative because it was signed after we sent.And in it the meaning of the saying without its letters.And it is meaning before they come to them with a painful torment that he will fear them, the anger of God, upon them, when they worshiped the idols, and they did not fear God, and they did not obey what he came to him.He warns them with torment that he will come from God to be his warning before the torment of torment.This requires that he commanded (P-187) that he teaches them with this torment, and that God has fulfilled the time of their survival after the evil after the informing of what he had to say to the The report falls in the same way, so the consequence of the verb is deleted to warn to the way of what comes after its saying that they worship God and fear Him and protect him [3].And the ritual (from) is a further for sure, that is: before they come to torment, it is a certainty kiss, and it is affirmed by administering the realization of what was added to me (before).The people of Noah are the people who were the land of the land on the day, as it is not found on the ground as it is as it appears to be the hadith of the intercession, and that is good.And the people: the group of people who are collected by one or one lineage with their men and their women and their kindness.And the addition of (people) to the guerrilla (Noah); Because he was sent to them, so they are more disturbed by him, and because he is one of them and they are among the children of him and Hasaba, so I added them to his guarantee, so that they have no, for them, for them, for them.The nations occurred after.It is changed from it to be said to him: to warn the people to his saying that your people warn of the same as Noah, so that you will be the hardship of the ripples on what is in them, so that they are the ones who are in them.And his closeness and loved it, and they are a number that formed the children in the children of Adam in the period of the seat of a year of the sweetest of the human being on the ground.Perhaps their number on the day of the sending of Noah to them, not to be married to a few thousand.
