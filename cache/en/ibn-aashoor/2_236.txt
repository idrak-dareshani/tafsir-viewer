The researcher, the Qur’an, is a wing of you, if you divorced women, what you did not touch or expose them to a satisfaction and they can be overwhelmed by the expand On the good, and if you divorced them before you touched them, and you have been satisfied with them, and we will be satisfied with what you have imposed, except that they are pardoned or pardon And that you are relieved of piety and do not forget the best among you, that God is what you do with vision (P-457).The skill is all, or some of it, and its stamps and the ruling of the enjoyment with the benefit of the divorce before the politician.The sentence is an outstanding, and it is not hidden, and it is not hidden.The divorce of the income with them, he went here on the divorce before the entry, and it is the one who says it, O O you who believe, if you see the believers They touched them [Al -Ahzab: 49] the verse, in the surah of the parties, and it is mentioned with that here the skill and forgiveness of it and the right to the ritual of the wing, as it is done in the saying of it.It must be depleted with them [Al -Baqarah: 158].The release of the wing is not known to the meaning of the ingredient, and that is the lamb of the two interpreters here on the negation of the ingredient in the divorce, and it was located in the scouts.He said: There is no wing to you: Do not follow you from the positive of the skill, then he said and the evidence that the wings are the followers of the skillful, and he said it, and if you divorced them, then you will say to him So he said, and describing what you have imposed a proof of the exile, then.Ibn Attiyah said, and a people said: There is no wing on you with it with it, there is no demand for all the skilled.We knew that the owner of the scout was caused by this interpretation, and it was not mentioned in the first place this meaning for the wives is true or metaphor, so it is not interpreted from it.The meaning of all words is not for the word (wing) and in it a distance, and it is carried on the fact that the wing is as a distance from the follower with a skillful payment.And the face is what was carried out on the gathering, to memorize the wing, and it is the meaning of the incorporation, and in the interpretation of Ibn Attiyah on the authority of Maki ibn Abi Talib: No, there is no Because the wing may fall on the divorced, after it was intended for the taste, and that is a matter before the politician.It is close to him in Al -Tayyibi about the one who wants to interpret it.What is meant by the verse is separated by the conditions of the payment of the skillful, or some of it, or its stamps, as if his saying is not a wing to you, if you divorced the women, what you did not A gift to that and a consumption of the pornography of divorce before the politician, because it is far from the intention of the taste, and the most from the divorce after the politician from the excitement And the woman, so it was the first kind of divorce with the judgment of the divorce before the construction.They intend to marry the pans, and it was forbidden to do the tons (P-458) who are more than the women of the women and their children, and the abundance of the people, Until it may be prohibited, so the verse was permitted by the exile of the wing in the sense of the minister.And the women: the curtains, and the disappearance in which the end of the race is in it, so it is in the context of the negation of the public, that is, there is no wing in your glory, the curtains, and the “what” is a jurisprudence, It is a woman from the birth of women.And in his saying, or they are exposed to them, they are an emotion to the exile, and “or“ if you fall into the negation of the negation, it will benefit the benefit The one who is given and the consequences is with him, and do not benefit the benefit that you benefit in the evidence, and it is the time of judgment for one of those who are emotional, alerted to that Its advantage is in the explanation of the scout, and Al -Tayyibi said: It is taken from the words of the desire, which is investigating; Because it is (or) in the evidence a counterpart that is the denial of the denial: it is the vague individual, then if the negation enters, the exile is obligated to all of the two things, and for this there was no saying in the saying Some of them are sinful or unjust [man: 24] The forbidden to obey both of them, not from obedience to one of them without the other A single prohibition, not with his eyes, based on that, that is only with a letter "or", and "or" or "if it is located in the end of the prohibition, it is like falling in the ritual of the nose.And the owner of the scout was made “or” in his saying, or they would be satisfied with them in the sense of only or even, and it is the one that corresponds to the harmony after it, then it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the one who is the one who is the same And on the authority of the hide, or “the emotion in the negative, on both the emotions; It may be deluded that it is for one of them as a result in the evidence, and based on the fact that it is attributed to his words, after that, and if you divorced them, then you have divorced them.You were satisfied with them, as it is confined to detailing on one of the two things: it is divorce before the politician, with the abuse of friends, and he did not remember the ruling, After him, and before the custody of the friendship, it was referred to that of the image, and it did not enter the precedent division, and that is because it is to be for the one, no It is deluded that the owner of the scout is the most powerful of the compassion for the integrity of his residence, but rather because otherwise here is clear and attributed: it means that it is not the same To deliver the intention of the negation of one of the two things, it is dangerous to the tears Al -Baydawi is permissible, its estimation is an emotion in this verse.(P-459) The verse has benefited a ruling on its humanity: which is the divorced woman before construction if it is not called a skill that does not deserve anything of the money, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the money, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the money, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the money, and this is the one who is the one who is the one.Al -Qarbi narrated on the authority of Hammad Bin Soliman that she has a class of truthfulness, and the gathering is on his dispute, and that only the one who is used, then they dispersed it.And this judgment indicated that the project has expressed marriage, a contract that is necessary to say, and it was considered the skill that is one of its milestones, not to be obligated to It is necessary for one of two things either with a form that specializes in it, and it is aware of its approach by saying, and it is expressing it in jurisprudence by the marriage of the name, and the name of the name The intended benefit from the marriage, which is the politician.In the contracts of arms, in which there is a look, and the soul is the saying of Hammad bin Solomon.And the verse indicated the fate of the origin of divorce, when I felt the exile of the wings from divorce before the politician Its rulings, and when we have no position, it is the same as the legacy of the divorce from this verse, so we are the same as the saying in this The pensions are the agreement: in the cultivation, the ethics, the whims, and the births, and we found the pensions two types: the first of whom is a tenth that is obtained by the ruling of the harm, and it is In power and weakness, according to the severity of the lineage and its dimension: as the penses of the fathers with the sons, and the brotherhood is with each other, and the children of the cousin, The power and weakness follows its choice in the exploitation of the costumes, so we find in the short time of the pensions, when the weakness of the insults, in which there is a bureau of the ritual When it is divided into the righteous from the contradictions in the whims and the mother, and God has made the proximity of the relative of the proportions, as a result of the inception of the compassion; Because it is in the proximity of the proximity of the lineage, the healing is with the other is stronger and the most powerful, and it will be similar, the practice and the approach to the one, so we will grow up from And the woven, what strengthens the union of the souls in the passions and the maids with the judgment of the mountain, and the ruling of the accustomed and the thousand, and so that the path is gone.The wip.And the second type: a publicity of the rule of the choice, which is the pensions of the companions, the disobedience, the need, and the Ma’wah, and it is only a temporary pensions: it is tired, or short, According to the power of the preacher (P-460) and its weakness, and according to the obedience to the extent of the rights of that The pensions, the default in that, and the sauce of this type is possible if the appearance is not determined.And the pensions of the two women, in the vigilance, is one of the second types, and in the effects that need the effects of the first types, and its shortness of the first types is caused by Al -Jabli, because the Zoom is that Not to be two closeness and reason for the two wives, at the first time of the marriage, until the pensions are prolonged, and each of the other is attributed to the other The man is in the woman.Until its speech, and in his molice to the one who sees it, since it was given to it and it was approved, and in his intention, it is a good man The soul of the two wives and the monuments of the monuments, and a trustworthy, and the place of the mountainous causes, and then the pensions are followed by the pension and a thousand things that will be done.The welfare, and God Almighty referred to this beautiful, vocal secret, by saying: And from his verses that he created for you from yourself, for you to be blessed to you, and they will be blessed to you.[Rum: 21].It may be presented with the contradiction of the ethical, and its contradiction, what is not reassured with the formation of these two causes or one of them, so he enjoys the place of law for the sake It turns the causes of hardship and enmity, so disturbance may be desirable to all the young people, and this is not a matter of in it, and it may be desired for one of them, The swing of one of the two sides: It is the side of the husband because his desire for the woman is more severe, how is he who sought it to her, and he desires to stand with her; Because the mind is in its type, it is more severe, and the view of it in the consequences is a lion, and it is not more informed to harm, and be patient with bad man The husband, and this clearance is the name: by divorce, so the man may be baptized after any of the men, and the woman may ask him from the man, and the Arab was asked in the man, and the Arab was asked The man is divorced and divorced her, Said bin Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nafil said that his husbands remember: “The arms of the people of the day And my two absences were the divorce that they saw what I had a little.You have come to me.To the same, if you are your kindergarten, then do not, so that you will be overwhelmed by the breasts of the camels (P-461) and made the urbanization of the referee, if the husband refuses to leave, and the husband is not right His twenty, after his duties were proven, to be released to him.The divorce is a copy of the contract of marriage: with the house of the abode in the sale, except that it is a dirt that did not involve the satisfaction of both of the two contracts, but it is a satisfaction, and it is a satisfaction.Introduction to separation with the perseverance to him, and this judgment is required to be The divorce is before the construction of the woman.As the ethical was not signed, but when the call to divorce was before the construction, it only for a great cause because the verb of the mind is not for the sake A woman, with her money and his soul to her divorce before the knowledge of it, had it not been for her to know that it was still his hope in its pensions, and the time was not, so the time was made.He made it easier after the category.And the jams read what they did not touch with the conquest of the foolishness, the harbinger of the touched of the deceased, and read the Hamza, the Kassayi, and the successor, and they forgot the al -Muallafah.And in the case after the Mim is a diamond.Because both young people touch the other.And his saying and their enjoyment of the expanded, the verse of the verse is a compassion for his saying, there is no wing to you, the success of the legislation on the legitimacy, on the authority of the union.It is not conditional on the investigators, and the guarantee is a source to the women: the work of the restricted verb with the definition, which is: What they did not touch or do not, They used the divorced women before the politician, and before the abuse, and I do not calculate anyone who makes the hostile to the guerrillas other than what we mentioned, and as for the difference between the scholarly between the scholar For the divorced woman who enters it, then this is for the other evidence other than this verse.And the matter is in his saying and their appearances, and it is the one who is the one who says Ali, Ibn Omar, Al -Hassan, Al -Zahri, Ibn Jabir, Qutdah, Al -Dahi, And Abu Hanifa, Al -Shafi’i and Ahmad said it; Because the origin of the formula is for the obligatory with the villages of its saying, the Almighty is really on the good and its saying, after that, in the following verse: the right of the one: The word (truly) is confirmed by the garment, and what is meant by the good people with these believers, so the good in the sense of the good is to the soul of it They made the divorced woman, other than the entry of it, and other than the name, it has a skill and a duty, which is the most likely: so that it is not the contract of its marriage to the one who is free.(P-462) And he made the group here to delegate, because he said after: really on the good, it is two villages on the way of the matter to one of what is required For the general scar in the sense of charity, and it is the saying of your money and a honest, so he made it a right on the good, and if it was obligatory, he would have made it a right over the whole, and the people of the people Really on the good, it is not a right to all people, as well as his fearful saying in the following verse, because the righteous is a lot of us Those who are righteous for every believer were among the two verses, the concept of the concept and the general, for the private concept devotes the general, and in the interpretation of the one who comes from the one who comes from Bin Muslim, who owns the owners of Malik: The one who is required to be judged, as it does not refuse to be among the beneficiaries, nor from the righteous, except for a man of badness, then the son of Arafa mentioned on the authority of Ibn Abd al -Sali He said that the general assessment of the concept is when it is opposite, and that it is the most correct of the fundamentalists, I said: It is a look, for it is the one who says that it is not, and it is not.The general public, if he displaces, is that the money is gone: that the enjoyment is giving, sympathy, and sympathy in the arrival of the improvement, so do not reach the exaggeration of the garment, and that it is the money of the Lord Model, so he goes back to rushes, and rushes are a delegate, not a duty, and the consort of that is the Almighty saying: Really on the improvement, then there is no gesture to that Rights, that God has denied the wing of the divorced, then the one who used to be used, and if the one was used, it would have been answered.Because the skilled is a specific thing, it may be made with the divorce, with the disagreement of the useful, for it is on the basis of his expansion, and for that, we deny the money of the one who did not.Building was called a skillful, he said: He calculated it, as it was imposed for it, that is, because God was shortened by that, accompanied by the divorce, that is, do not delegate it, Malik said: that the divorced woman who entered it, is that it is desirable to enjoy it, that is, with the baptism sitting, and what has passed from the work of the predecessor.And he said on the expanded, and on the one who is able to expand it, if it becomes a capacity, and the one is the one who is established if it becomes a hardship: and it is a lifetime And by opening it to what he has the same thing, or his condition, and he will be called on what is equal to the boundaries of the boundaries, and he will be called what he equals in the value, and the person is the case with it.The woman, in the paths of people in the richness, which is (P-463) the class of the people, and the energy from the money, and the generosity read it with a sign of the sign, and the son of the son of Dhuan, the son Humza, Al -Kisa’i, Dhuha from Asim, and Abu Jaafar with the conquest of the sign.And his saying, and we will describe what you have imposed on the beginning of the news: briefing, for the appearance of the meaning, that is, we describe what you have imposed for them, with the same as the saying In it except this face.And the prejudice to his saying, and we will describe what you have imposed, indicating that it is then that it has no.And his saying is only to pardon or pardon the one who has the contract of marriage, a dedication from the general public, that is, except in the case of their forgiveness, that is, the women: And the name of this projection is a phenomenon, because the description of the skilled is a right, and it is necessary for the divorce of the divorce before the construction of what it is, or what it is, or what it is, or what it is, or what it is, or what it is.For a sacrifice, then its projection is a pardon, not a referral, or when the pardon of the hand of marriage, and the “no” in the marriage For the sons, and he is replaced by the contract of the woman's marriage, not in the acceptance of the husband, and if both of them were called a contract, it is not the case, not a referral for the saying The marriage is a male, and it is not the divorced, because it was the divorced, he said: Or pardon the speech, because before it, and if you divorced it, they did not come to them.It was said: He came with the arrival of the pardon of the divorced woman, because he was in his hand the contract of marriage, so it was divorced, so it was a grandfather, and it was a grandfather.It is left for her all its truthfulness, and it is a repetition that if I want this meaning, he said, or they pardoned the one in his hand Women; Because he has a contract with her marriage; As its marriage is not complicated except with it, if the one who is intended by the forced guardian is: the father is in his daughter, the deceased, and the master is in his mother, so he will be with his hand He made that from his class by adopting what was, as he does not take care of that, and if what is meant is the divorce of the guardian, then he will be in his hand The woman is on his presence, and they were to address the guardians in their states, so the pardon is in the positions of truth, and the equity of the salt is a metaphor, and this is the saying of your money; As he made in Al -Muwati: the hand of the contract is the father in his daughter, the good, and the master is in his mother, and he is the saying of the Shafi’i in the valley, so the verse is a male Rashida, and the one who is on it, and the attribution of what is close to this saying to a group of the predecessor, including the son of Abbas, the relationship, the good, the mortality, and the one who said: The marriage is the divorced woman because his hand is the same as the acceptance, and it is attributed to me, and the evil, and a jacket, and a juvenile, and it is the saying of Abu Hanifa, and al -Shafi’i: In his hand (P-464), the contract of marriage, that his hand is in it: with the keenness, and the annulment with divorce, and the meaning of his pardon: his fully gave him.This is a saying that is far from two faces: one of them, that the verb of divorced then is not called pardon, but rather, and a suggestion; Because it means that the fully pushed the friendship, he said in the scouts: the name of the increase is forgiven by the truth in which there is a view of it, except that it was said: the majority of them were for them.Dougher, if divorced, he is entitled to ask her to describe the rods.The second is that the payment of the complete divorced divorced for the divorce is a charity that does not need a special legitimacy, with the disagreement of the forgiveness of the woman or her for it, so he has thought that one of the people had a good thing From the contract, it is not correct to drop anything from it.And say it, and that you are pardoned for piety, which is the pardon, that is, the pardon from where it is, and for that, the verb is deleted, and the speech is for the whole of the nation, He came to the group of the remembrance of the abuse, and it is not a speech for the divorced people, otherwise the forgiveness of the women did not include the people of the people, with all of it.The verse is that what is meant by his hand is the contract of divorced marriage, because he crossed after him, by saying that he is pardon Shamil in the Qur’an is like the Qur’an, as it is reconciled between them and reconciling is better [Women: 128].And the meaning of the universe of forgiveness is close to piety: that forgiveness is close to the attribute of piety from holding the right; Because committing to the right does not contradict the piety, but it is permissible to crucify his owner and his intensity, and forgiveness is permissible to give his friend, and the mercy of the Lord, And the mercy, close to piety from the heart of the hard, because the piety is close to the power of the power of the palace, and the parallel is a junction and a servant, and in the heart of the heart, and in the heart of the heart The survival is clear from the grievance and the harshness, so the piety will be close to it for the many causes in it.And his saying, and do not forget the best among you, a second dissolution, given to the dissolution that before it, to increase the desire to be forgiven, and in the pardon of what is in it, and in the pardon of what is in it, and in the pardon of what is in it, Salemah (P-465) So they were commanded in this verse that they pledge the grace, and do not forget it; Because his forgetfulness is between them and him, so he will be broken from them, and he is about to need pardon other than him in another sequence, so in his knowledge of the one who has a pledge of the same And disobedience, and that is a way that is clear to union, fraternity, and the benefit of this description at the solutions of experience.And the forgetfulness is here to be for the timing, and the lack of acquisition, as in the saying of the Almighty, so taste what you forgot to meet your day this [prostration: 14] and it is many in the Qur’an, and in the Qur’an, and in the Qur’an, This is the pardon, if it is not forgotten by some of them with each other, and his saying: God is what you do with the vision of the righteousness in the way That in the pardon the pleasure of God is the Almighty, then he sees that of us and he is rewarded for him, and his counterpart is saying, so you are our eyes [Al -Tor: 48].
