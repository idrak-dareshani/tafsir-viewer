The Quranic researcher (P-115) is forbidden for you the dead and blood and the flesh of the pingling and what I have for it for the other hand, so whoever is forced to be unprecedented, and there is no one who has no, so there is no good, for the sake of God.Biany, so that the ears of the goods are the question of the question of who asks what the good women are suddenly.The rituals of the anti -antagonist, which is used from the form of the exclusivity, but rather the way to the way against the tubes of the brothers; The forbidden is a few, and because in this confinement, it is anxious with the partners who have forbidden themselves for many of the goods, and they are the good of the dead, and the dead, and the dead, My right thing is that the one who addresses them are the believers and they do not believe in the dispute of what is approved for them, and it was not in this short With a way of exposing.Rather, in the sense of “what otherwise”, that is, what is forbidden to you except the dead and what was composed of it, and known from the place that the intended is what is forbidden from the food.And the forbidden: the variety is a severe prevention.And the dead man is to be afraid, it is at the origin of the language that the death hit, so it is reduced and tightened, whether the dead and the dead, then the light is in the light with the one who is the one Her dictates, if she dies with a sky, then it was said: This is from the transfer of the law, and it was said: It is a definitive truth before the law, and it is the phenomenon with the same as the one who is in the way.And the dead was read by the dead, with the slight of the ya, and Abu Jaafar read it to tighten the yaa.And the addition of prohibition to the same dead and what was composed of it is from the question surnamed in the origins of jurisprudence with the addition of analysis and prohibition to the two people, and the one who carries it from what is meant The eye is to adopt its type, we are forbidden to the dead [Al -Ma’idah: 3] or by administering the place, we are forbidden to you, your mothers are in you [23].The context, or it is said: The name of the self is established from the doctrine of the action that is intended for the sake of the language, so if it is determined by what is meant by the shortness of the prohibition Publica, so that your mothers are forbidden to you [Women: 23] are the ones who are forbidden to marry them, and what is the goods of that as it is required, so it is not necessary for it, so that the ritual is not.They followed them or their conversation, and they are: so they avoided the lineage to the facilitator (P-116) and the Zalam is the one who is in the face of the game, and it is not the same, general; Because it is defined by the words of the spectrum, then the prohibition of eating the dead is the text of the verse and its comfort for the fact that the verb is forbidden after his saying, “They are not good.” [172] He agreed upon him among the scholars of Islam, and they differed as the largest of the intended is the reward of the dead Like the integrity with its wool and what is not connected to its flesh, from what was extracted from it at the time of its life, so your money said: It is permissible for the benefit to be with that, and it is not possible for it to be.Life except the weapon of the elephant, the ivory elephant, and its evidence is on this prohibition that is removed from this verse, but it is taken with the significance of the sign; Because it is forbidden to eat the whole dead, he pointed to the stupidity of its flesh and what is in its own meanings, and Al -Shafi’i said: He is forbidden by the benefit of all the parts of the dead, and there is no sign of it from the verb.Because the verb is in the matter of pronouncements, there is no general for it, and because the dead person is not given, and it is not complete, then it is not the form of the general, so he returns to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the With the families of the names or its slopes, which is a matter that returns to the insults of the splendor of the past With the dead, the dogs are not fed up with the dogs or the wounds, because that is a warning of the intended to be intended for it, and God has forbidden it with a divorced person, with a stubbornness, So he said an agreement to say that Malik said, while he was not.As for the skin of the dead, it has a similarity on the side of its appearance, as it is like the hair and the wool, and from the side of its interior, as it is like the meat, and the exhibitions of these are the same Interacting with the deadness of the dead if he is dyed, then Ahmad ibn Hanbul said: He does not purify the skin of the dead with the tan Al -Khanzir, because he is forbidden to the eye, and this is attributed to Al -Zuhiri, and the Shafi’i right is the skin of the dog with the skin of the pink, and the money of God said: He becomes a crucifixion that is not interfered with what he brings, and his interior is not purified by the dumplings, and for that he said: It is permissible to seek the skin of the dead dubbing in the water of the water, and the water is in it.He prayed with him or upon him, and the saying of Abu Hanifah is more likely to the hadith of the authenticity, “The Prophet ﷺ saw a dead sheep that was for the mother of the mother of the mother who said: So you wanted it, so you would benefit from it.”And when he came in the other hadith of his saying,“ Whatever terrorism is tanned, it has been purified ”, and it appears that these two experiences did not When you have a money, but their health has been proven by others, and the measurement requires the purity of the skin of the tanned The vitality is not the owner, it is a remover by the meaning of the murder and the two widows of the woman.It is excluded from the death of the dead whale and the like from the animals of the sea that does not live in righteousness, and the words will come upon it when it is the saying of the Almighty.96] In Surah Al -Akdes.And know that the wisdom is forbidden Only, I may be infected with a different, and it is left as it is left in the flesh of the animal, as part of it.The animal, if its role stops in which the harmful parts are overwhelmed by the beneficial parts of the parts, and for that the intelligence was made, because the consumer died from the same In which he makes his flesh pure from what is feared from him.And for the sake of this, Malik said in the gin: that his thunderbolt is the intelligence of his mother; Because he is to connect him to the parts of his mother, he became a vulnerability of his mother’s blood, emptying his blood.Heaven is the intelligence of his mother, "And with him, the Shafi’i took, and Abu Hanifa said: Jenin is not eaten if he comes out as a dead person, so it is considered that it is dead, and it is not true, But the measure that we mentioned in the support of the money that is not accepted.Some of the jurists have the right to the wounds, the deadness of his death, because his diets are excused, and he is the saying of Ibn Nafaa and Ibn Abd al -Hakim in the money A Muslim from the hadith of Abd Allah ibn Abi Wafi, “Our invasion with the Messenger of God ﷺ seven conquests that we were eating the jars with him” uh.Whether it was with a difference with a rhetoric attached to the eating of or was a stakeholder, a stakehold So the verse is summarized because it is a authentic hadith, and as for the hadith of “we have the deadness of the thickness and the generosity,” it is not reconciled to the specialization, because it is the one who said that it is the one who said that it is a weak.Malik and his companions prevented him, except that the intelligence of his proverbs is destroyed, such as the wind in hot water or cut what he does not live in its cut.Perhaps your money, may God have mercy on him.Walking: If the jarb in the instincts (P-118) included it, it is a stimulus for it, and it was mentioned in Al-Muwati the hadith of Omar and said as the core of the ink in the jam Like the hebeat in my name, “Covering the covering on the one”.As for blood, it is the text of God on its prohibition, because the Arabs were eating blood, they were taking the help, so they fill them with blood, then they will eat it.The ruling on the prohibition of blood is that his drink is inherited as a harm in the human being, so he will be tired of his rituals and becomes like a vast time To complete the honor of the ethics and the dimension of the human being from the release and the arrogance, and for that it is restricted in some of the verses with the sorry, that is, the burning, because it is a lot of it, because it is a lot of it And if he used to inherit it, he will be a victim, Therefore, the project forgave what remains in the veins after the blood of blood that is shed by slaughter or the sacrifice, and many of the jurisprudence of the soul of the blood of the blood of the blood Malik, and their orbit in that weak, and perhaps they have seen with that that it has a dirt.The blood is known for its signs in the language, and it is a stimulus of the stimuli from the food, and it has life, and the origin of its creation in the body is coming from the dumbbell of the blood of blood G’sly, with the medium of the Egyptian, connected between the mercy and the body of the gin, which is cut off at the time of the birth, and its renewal in the body of the animal after the time The nutrition is the same as the digestion of the meter for the meant He pushes him to the serenity, which is the thick veins and to the elegant veins, with the power of the movement of the heart by opening and closing a macculial movement in the air, in the vastness, and in the past It is transmitted from each other to one by the point of the movement of the heart and the breath of the lungs, and that of the rituals is greeted by the rot, so if it is wrong, it is wrong The animal died.The flesh of the pink is the flesh of the animal known to this name.Some of the interpreters said: The Arabs used to eat the bench, without humanity, that is, because they did not get used to the rabies of the pigs, and if it was the porn, and if the sacrifice was Hoshi, the human beings are pronounced by prohibition or equality of the mud.And the remembrance of the flesh here because it is the intended for eating, there is no significance in its remembrance of the permissibility of something other than it, and it is not over it, for it may express it with the grace As he said, the Almighty said about Zakaria, the Lord, I am the great of me from me [Maryam: 4].(P-119) It was said in the face of the remembrance of the flesh here and left it in his saying, but the dead and the faces of the son of Attiyah said: The intention is the intention More not, or not.And his intention of this is that it is not an understanding that it is forbidden if it is a dead and a distance in it, and Al -Alwsi said: He specialized to the purification of his prohibition, because they are the best of them.Perhaps they grew up and fell into its prohibition.He wants that his remembrance of the increase in the seizure, that is, that flesh, which you remember with his view, and I do not count that, because those who have been used to the rituals, And when the insertion of the memorizers of the flesh here is either a mobilization in the eloquence, or the gesture to the purity of itself as the backens of the animal, but the forbidden is the eating of it.For people to kill him or torture him, so there is an argument for him to go to the money of the eye of the eye The pingling of lively livestock, or for the relaxation in the integrity with its poetry; Because they were invoking the skin.And the ruling on the prohibition of the flesh of the pingling is that the ingredients are inflicted with excesses, and it will arise in his fever, which is what he did not.He killed him.And it is surprising that the people are exposed to and the jurisprudence in the prohibition of the water of the water, which is an empty issue, as the names of the types of whale are taken into account, as they are the same as the whale, as it is the same as the whale.The horse of the sea, and some of it is the mark of the sea and the dogs of the sea, so how does one say with the effect of the names and the nicknames in the legal rulings and in the debt in the custody The water of the water and said: You say Khunzir.Ibn Shasa said: He saw one other than that the money of a right to the work of the general is permitted to you It is not standing in it, but he was forbidden from the answer, as they called them a pink, and for that he said: You are called it, so that it is a breach that is not the same.Khanzir and that his name does not want to be a pink, then the question about his eaters until he says, “Say, eat the flesh of the pink, that is, so that the words of the words are returned to the words of the words Not to be tired of it, and on the authority of Abu Hanifa that he prohibited the eating of the sea of ​​the sea, it is not frequented by the one that he was named after the sole of it.Not for this whale to be another name in the language of some Arabs, so it is its eaters forbidden on a partner and permissible for a partner?And the words of the Almighty and what I have to do with it for the other hand, that is, what was announced by him or we would like to be upon him other than the name of God Almighty, and he is taken from his family, if he raises the words of the words, And they say: The boy was shouted if he raised (P-120) his voice with crying, and he is happy with Hajj or Umrah if he raises his voice with the custody of the time, and the one who is a good man The man said: Is the intention of the alerts, the righteousness of the voice, and it is also the name of the voice of the immortality of the horses, and it was said that it was derived from the crescent, because it was the one who was Some of them called for each other, and he has the success of the linguists and the people of the detence, and perhaps the name of the crescent if it was derived and they would shout at the time In the sense of raising his voice, because the people of the family are more, and because they called the Crescent a month of the month as it will come.And the Arabs were in the ignorance, if they were slaughtered or sailed for the oligarchy, they shouted in the name of the idol at the sacrifice, and they said: In the name of the laat or in the name of the condolences, or by the condolences, and the name of the condolences, or the name of the The gods of the gods if the two sins are closer to them, and the call of the servants and his prayers at the sacrifice to him at the time He came in Humirus.So he qualified in the verse a building for the face, that is, what is qualified is for the name of God, and the people of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of it, so that it is a matter It is closer, for the bitter guarantee of the budget is based on what I have, and the benefits of these guarantees are prohibiting what is close to it for the other than God, the Almighty, with the authority of God No, and what is meant by God is idols and their surroundings.As for what Sudan sacrifice our country with the intention that heaven drinks his blood and does not remember the name of God upon him, claiming that the heaven is a disbelief from the name of the name of God And if those who do it are Muslims and do not remove them from Islam.And Ibn Arafa said in his interpretation: The appearance is permissible, because he did not give it to him for the other.And his saying: Whoever is forced, etc.The fulfillment in it is forced to separate the news, not to exclusive the meaning, because the meaning of raising the embarrassment from the one who is obligated, and it does not arise from Al -Darata resorted to him, that is, the need, that is, he was forced to eat something of these prohibited women, so he does not sin against it, and his saying is not a habit, and no one is, and the prostitute, the darkness, And the coming of this situation is here for his intention to be obligated in the case of his permissibility of his forbidden all of him that he is eating it, so it is not a habit, and no one, because it is not, because it is a backwardness, because it is the same, because it is the same And the ritual, the verse is a gesture to the cause of the summary, which is the lifting of the prostitute and the aggression between the nation, and it is also a gesture to the limit The prostitute and the aggression that it will be overwhelmed and accommodated (P-121), and this is a discipline, because people are varying in the burning of hunger and the disliked of the mood, and the mood of the mood, The jurisprudence is the one who defines the deportation with the fear of perishing and their intending to pass on to death and illness, otherwise the condition of the supervision of the death does not benefit from it.The one who is obliged to be informed of this prohibition is underway in the case The prohibited if he does not find it, and he is eating it from hunger, and if he is afraid that the need is passed by it, as the one who is the one who is in the travel of a travel that is provided that it is provided He took advantage of her to her, because he does not know whether he agrees with her and her emotions again, and it is like a wonder of jurisprudence between jurisprudence to be attributed to my father, and he is not.It is saturated and does not provide a disagreement for the king in that and the most promising is that it is a disagreement of the righteous, and God Almighty says that God is forgiven, merciful in the disposal On some of his hunger and command the walking to the meeting with himself to destroy if he does not provide?And it was interpreted His saying is other than a head, and no one is returned to the other: so that Al -Shafi’i is that he is not the one who is al -Baghi and al -Adi on the imam, not disobedient with his travel, so there is no privatization for him, so there is no one for him.The persecutions, and the money answered: that his disobedience to the travel does not require that he be commanded with a greater disobedience, which is the contradiction of himself by leaving the whole, and it is the same.And from what they have taken over in his measurement on the harm of hunger, the harm of the circulation, then it was not the healing of his forbidden hobbies, nor in anything from what God has forbidden, and this is the money of the money, and this is the money of the money, People are formed by the union of the heart, which is the memorization of life, and when it is that the cause is achieved in it, when it is not the same as the knowledge of the knowledge All of them are only what was tired of it, and how many mistakes were for the soles in the properties of the medicine, and the pride was transferred from each other, the pornography The power of the actor thinks of the benefit of the deprived medicine from a great disease and its insurance, or that is prevalent in experimenting.And Abu Jaafar read: Whoever is forced to break the Ta'a, because his origin is forced with two opinions, they are broken, so when I want to slide the first rituals in the second in the second in the second of the second in the second of the second Taa after the winding of the taa.And his saying is that God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.Because he is merciful to people, the forgiveness is here in the sense of the convergence (P-122), what is possible to take it, not in the sense of the righteousness of the sin, and the one who says it.The heart and in its distribution is weak, and God forgives him.The meaning of the verse: that the rising of ingredient from the obligated is a ruling that suits those who describe the forgiveness and mercy.
