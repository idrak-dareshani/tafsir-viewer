The Quranic researcher (P-342), if you do not do and you will not do, then fear the fire that people and the carpentry were prepared for the disbelievers, so that it is a separation on the condition, that is, the condition is that it is the condition.With a wall or came to what you claimed that it is a surah - and that your testimony was unable With the miracle of the Qur’an, so fear his enemy punishment for your likes.And the act of (do) is deleted, which is indicated by the context, that is, if you do not do that, that is, to come with a similar wall, and the words will come to the words of the words Likewise, when he said: If you do not do, then what you have reached his messengers [Al -Ma’idah: 67]) in Suraida.It comes with the condition in which the one in which the severity of the piece is with the fact that the number of their actions is the most likely in the coccy of the position of the definition and the miracle; Because the intention is to purify this condition in the image of the ransom in exaggeration in the availability of their cores on the exhibitions of the way of the million and the urbanization, and the exclusion of it, and the exclusion of it, and the exclusion of it, and the exclusion of it, Take the seat of the characteristic of the characteristic, and a custody of the elders of its perseverance, and the argument of it in what is better, even if it comes to the right and described it from its soul in the same way.Therefore, he came after him and you will not do as if the mosque is arranged in their affairs, and their command decides, and he says first, they come with a wall, then he will say that they will not say It is like it and prepare for its status, and it is clear from it.With what is in this, the availability of their halls on the opposition with the style of the bereaved and the warning.Therefore, it is good for the satellite (no) that is indicative of the exile of the future, so the negation of it is sure of the negation without, and this is why Sibui said: “No” To the exile, “will do”, so the Khalil said: “It will not“ a disgraceful letter from not navigational and that the future is.It is a good opinion, and if it is the exile of the future, it indicates the supportive negation of it because it was not long for the limits of the one It is not the first of it, and it is not the first of that And the words of the Arabs, so I found it only in the place of the will of the affirmative or the persons.And the words of the cell in the origin of its placement support that, so whoever said from the grammarians that it does not benefit the affirmation and does not reflect on it.And say it and you will not do from the greatest miracles of the Qur’an, as it is a miracle of two directions: the first is that it has proven that they did not oppose that they are that this is the same They were able, and all of it (P-343) has confirmed that before: (If you are true [Al-Baqarah: 23]), and that is the deficiency of the miracle from It is like the same, so it is indicated that it is the words of those who were able to be at the top of the human being.The second is that it was informed that they do not come to that in the future, so what is one of them came, nor from those who succeeded them with what contradicts the Qur’an, so the verse of the verse was from the absence On the authority of the abolition, it is stated on the punishment of the two years, because the verses of the many oppositions in the Qur’an have been brought up with the hearing of those who suffer from the Arabs of the Arab And the news between them was frequent and the knees walked with it, where the claim of its ignorance - and the reasons for the opposition are not exalted - in them - in their own place of what is in their own place The words of the vicious words are their poets and their rhetoric.المــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ To pay the captain of the domination of their domes and their debt, and the victory of their gods, and stopping the hierarchy of the entry of their men in the religion of Islam.With what Al -Arabi was known to be from the abandonment of the dominance and the hatred of the possibility.So what is sufficient for the adequate from the two of the Qur’an except for their miracles from that, and that is a pilgrimage to that it is descended from God, and it is the same, and it is the same It has joy, rumors, and transmitting it, for they are accustomed to the words of their abundance before before the defamation is tempted, so what they thought of them is from them This is the possibility, and the absence of the stuttering of something that is claimed from that is required to be tied to the fact that they have grabbed his exhibitions, and we will be alerted to this The verse 0 and (do) the first is permissible with no referral; Because “the stipulation has entered the act after its adoption, so it would be the meaning of the condition, who is not and did not do so, so it appears, so it appears, so it appears.“And“ and “did not” work in (do you do) for the two meanings, so the difference is not imposed in it between the grammarians in the health of the person who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a ward Ibn al -Alaj is one of the grammarians of the Andles, we attributed it to him in the permissibility on the clarification that the truth is that there is no prohibition from it with the union of the one who has the meaning of the meaning, Ali Al -Farisi in the symptoms and from the book of recalling to him that he made the saying of the ritual: ؎ You see it, as if it was from the honors of the honorable people Between “as if the“ tightened ”and as if the“ light ”.And his saying, Fear the fire, an effect of the condition of the condition in his saying, if you did not do, indicate a sentence of deletion (P-344) to be briefly because the answer to the condition is what is the condition By the condition for his sake, which is the benefit of his saying, and if you are in a rappe of what we have revealed to our servants [Al -Baqarah: 23], then the answer of his saying: So, believe that what was brought to him is Muhammad, who is descended from us and that he is true to what he commanded him from the duty of the servants of God alone and beware of him His saying, Fear the fire, signed the answer to his path to him and his harm to him, and it is a brief summary, and that is that the help of the fire was not from what they believe in To deny them the mission, then if the Messenger is shocked, the faith is obligatory for them.Rather, he crossed (you did not do and you will not do) (If you did not bring me with it [Joseph: 60]), etc., because it is noticed (you do) here is from the brevity that is not the same in the last verse, as the one who is the one who is the one who is in the past is in this A special place in a special way, which is the one who comes to him, like this Qur’an, and witnessed to him and seeking him with their testimony, so he was in the authority of God) Descriptions and resources are a brief that is not required by the etiquette that is in the surah of Yosf.And the steps with the opening of the waw is a name for what it is led by it, and the guarantee is a source, and it was said by the opposite, and Ibn Attiyah said that the ritual of the annexation and the conquest in each of the wiping.And the measurement of “action” by opening the fulfillment is that it is a name for what is done with it, such as light, hypnotics, frits, and waging, except for sevenness of the provinces, and it was returned to the conquest of the conquest, and it is the conquest, and it is.Illness, budget, linguistics, and fuel.And the conquest is the appointment here because the intended is the name, and it is read by the guarantee in the anomalous, and that is on the adoption of the annexation as a source or on the addition of the added of any of the people.People want it to be a kind of them, and they are the infidels, so the definition of it is the definition of the Arifiqa, and it is permissible for it to be the most important of the covenant; Because they are the one who has been known from many other verses.And the carpentry gathered a stone on others, and it is a tendency that is rare in their words.And the state.On the authority of Abu Al -Haytham, that the Arabs enter the distraction in every gathering on a verb or action, because if he stands on him, he will be gathered in it at the end of the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The standing is upon him, that is, it is improved to be light if they stand on it, and it is not from the meeting of the diversified, and from that of the bones, and the dignity of the A collection and a collection of “baking” with the opening of the B, and the shoes of the collection of a skilled collection (P-345) and the meaning and the fuel of the carpentry that the stone made it for it to be the place of the wiping, if it is more And slowly, and from the carpentry their idols, it is a carpentry, and that came to be clear in his saying, the Almighty is that you are what you worship without God The verse is an inflicting by the threatening of the addressees, and the meaning that is supplied with it: warn that you will be and what you worshiped and the fuel of the fire, and the conscience of the exposure: (And the Majra) because when they were commanded to lead it, they would be warned that they were the people, and when the cargization was mentioned, they were their idols, so it is necessary that they are the people.Idols, the exposure here is varying, and the first of it is in one medium, and the second is in two ways.And the ruling on the meeting of idols in the fire with the fact that the rule of the part is not shown that this is a hatred for it and the increase in the decline Because of their insult to her insult, and their wonders also that what they prepared is a reason for their glory and pride in their torment, and what they prepared for their grace To their torment, the Almighty said that you and what you worship without God, the Hell of Hell [Al -Anbiya: 98] the verse.And the knowledge of the fire for the covenant, and its description of the continuous connector, the knowledge of those who address the prayers as it is the majority in the connection of the connector to download the ignorant The fact that the hell is fulfilled, or because it was described as hell with that, it was decided that it was descended before the Qur’an, as his saying, is the Almighty in Surah Al -Tahim, We yourself and your family are fire and the fuel of the people and the carpentry [Prohibition: 6] and if the wig of the prohibition is numbers in the light that came down after the wine of the cow, then it is in the authority of the cow, then the cow is in the authority of the cow, so then in the authority of the cow, then it is in that Or because he has learned from them from the news of the people of the book.And in making people and strokes and a clear fuel that the fire of hell is raised before the people were thrown into it, and that people and the carpenter are met with it because it is the fire of the fire.As he referred to the hadith of the Mudda: “The intensity of the freedom is from the hell, so if the Adami communicates with it, he will make it and ripen his skin, and if it comes to it.” And in the burning of the ancient Miss is a sophisticated one that brings this closer to people today.It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that Hell is a vengeance of the Grandground of the Grands, so we will be the most miserable of the knees.And his saying was prepared for the disbelievers.A second line or another link, and made it a loud and fools and entered the righteous in the hearts of the addressees, and it is an illness that they were prepared for them.(P-346) This verse has proven the miracle of the Qur’an is a well-known proof that the Qur’an is distinguished from the rest of the miracles, for if the man of the miracles is for us and the miracles of the miracles of our miracles and the miracles of our miracle The prayer and peace be upon them, but it was proven with the news of one and the one who has been established from all of it, and it is the fate of all of it.And the courage of Omar The Qur’an, so its miracle is proven by the transmitted frequencies.And it was perceived by the general public.The private may be realized from others with sense, as well as what we will show.As for the realization of the Arabs, the Qur’an is a show of this verse and its proverbs, so they lied to the Prophet ﷺ and they were exposed and exposed to his followers, so they are the most important of them.God revealed it to him, and he made Delil that he is from God, who was rewarded for his status The rhetorical rhetoric did not know its words in the words of their linguistics from the speeches and poets, then he tightened them to the chapter on the matter of his belief or his denying it They are their opponents because of what he brought or rewarded for that, with that Quran, as it is a place of its places, so that they could not be able They prepare two things: Either they are their cushion, because the Qur’an has reached, while he was deducted from it from the rhetorical characteristics that the situation requires the same as the enemy to the time With it, if they gathered their recklessness, and their readers were crowded, and they were commanded, and they will be overwhelmed in their clubs, their stomachs, and the markets of their name, so that it is not for me.The joke and the characteristics have found all of that, and the verses of the Qur’an have come to him in his example and came with greatness from it, then if he had a right to them, then he was a later, and a successor, So I did not show what they did from the joke, and that was found that the verse in which the conversion of the two princes was praised, and I have been counted in the characteristics of the characteristics, and the brother has not been done.From it, this is the destiny that he realized by the abolition of the Arabs with their breakfast, so they exposed his status of knowledge that they are not accepted.The opinion, where they do not offer themselves to the conjugation and do not satisfy themselves to themselves with recession, so that they saw the imitation of the exhibit They are in miracle of the opposition in the same way as this verse, so they may have seen that the silence is accepted from the interpretation of the nose that is not accepted.The Qur’an has proven that it is a miracle of its own justice as a time that the human beings cannot The honesty of the Messenger, for the miracle of the opposition to this face was for the destruction of the ability to come (P-347) in its example, and this is the opinion Ash'ari is like Abi Bakr Al -Baqalani and Abd al -Qahir al -Jarjani, which is the one who is famous for Al -Ash'ari.It may be permissible to be able to come in the same way, with the opposition, but God has shown them from the confrontation with it with the dowry On that, then their reply from that - with the disagreement of their conditions - is a supernatural matter for the return as well, and it is the indication of the miracle, and this is a time from the saying Abu Bakr al -Baqlani in his book on the miracle of the Qur’an and he was not appointed to him, saying, and the attribution was attributed to him in the Book of Al -Muqasad to the two sayings: The miracle is from the one who says: The disgraceful and many of the disgraced, and the fabrication attributed it to the father of Isaac al -Irbarin, and attributed it to Ayad to the father of Al -Hasan Al -Ash'ari, but he did not say, but he did not know.The one who is satisfied with the Shiites as in the purposes, and it is with his being sufficient in the fact that their miracle on the opposition to the miracle of God for them is a weak king, and the words of the words of the word The Qur’an is detailed in the adopted submission of this interpretation.If you say: Why is it not permissible for the Arabs to be left to the opponents, unavoidable.After that, whoever believes that the Arabs would have known the Qur’an and did not transfer to us what they knew about.I said that it is that they are doing that.If Muhammad was sent in a nation that has a hostility, it is none of as Moses was sent in the sons of Israel, who are supporters of him and those who were fools, and the Arabs were of the Arab ﷺ When they lied to him, and they decreased it with the Sunnah and magic, and otherwise, it was not followed by them, except for a little alienation, weakening between their people, and there is no one in their people.From the command of his people that they are a leader and then commanded him to be exalted between them by killing him and rejected him for his time We will be trimmed by us on the lie, and they will come upon him after his exodus, as well And the walk, and that was not the opponent in a short period of time, through which the incidents of the junction can be made, and the publication of the opposition, so it is a period of nine tenth to the day Mecca.(P-348) There is no crime that the maximum desire for them in that period is the purification of his denying it as a victory for their soul It was fixed with the frequencies at all the nations, which are miserable, from the horse, the rum, the dignity, and the dirt.There is no crime that the Qur’an was limited to the distance of the argument, and they have a way to his commitment to the truth of what they attributed to him, so he gave them a book that was descended from the stars and called them With a short piece of it, and that they gather for that testimony and their helpers, we have made this book, all of this is proven by the frequency, so that the book is not.They leave the knowledge of the people of religion from the nations.And his detention is to seek the opposition, and it is fixed with the frequent known for our children, for it is this book that believed in Muslims before he opened a makkah with him and kept him, and all the Arabs believed in him, too After a generation.And these deceased were the one who was called to the opposition in the place known from the authenticity of the opinion and the residence of the insulting, and the minds of the minds, and the extent of the rituals of Zayf, The estimated art in the suffering and the conservation.All of them are frequent from them with what was said of their words, in terms of systems and prose, and with what was famous and frequent from the blessed destiny among the narrators from the bodies of their bodies They want them to oppose him, even if they find it on the jurisprudence of their hands, because the validity of their groans, I realize that it is perpetuated, the same is the same, so they are the same.About the opposition with the sake of their calling for the pride and their keenness, even if they found a way to it.Their symptoms of the opposition were proven by the way of frequency, if it was like this, this would not be declared and spread it, and the people are transmitted because it is one of the great journeys, so they are the great.With the tongue to the fighting and the struggle, it is proven by the frequencies, not the case with the people of the history and others.Whatever you made because of their symptoms from the opposition from the abandonment of his words about the tower of humanity or from the shores of God, their dedication to that is a sign of a matter From the creator of destiny and the miracle of human beings.And this is all other evidence that defines us that the Arabs are well -off, they have left the sincerity of the Messenger, and they were mutilated for the miracle And that they did not lie except stubbornness or an arrogance and a cursing on the chain of horses and an alienation from the confessions of mistake, that indicative is the Islam of all the tribes of the Arabs (P-349) After opening Mecca, they were stated by a Quraysh in the opposition, who followed the followers of this religion Quraysh was dominated, and the rest of the Arabs resurrected from the coming of the coming, who are old, who are unknown, so they were overwhelmed, so they were able to seek the sake of the ritual Quraysh has proven that it was from those doves the people of the misery and the severity of the Arabs of a glory and a slowdow It is known in the nations of the nations and its ethics to reject the great doves of many condemnation, and its authenticity and the entirety of its entirety are brought up.There was no club in it, and no traveler was pleased with them, and they were not gathered.Then in this verse, it is a restlessness, and it is its saying, and you will not do, so it has passed the juris Explain, as the opposition did not fall from one of the addressees, nor from those who joined them today.If you say, you will be proven by this, that the Qur’an is incapable of the Arabs, and that is proven to them that they are miraculous and have proven to them with the truth of the rituals, and for the sake Not like them, what is the miracle of others?I said: The confirmation of miracle does not require the equality of the people in the way of the confirmation, because if the Arabs miraculously, you are a mow of the return to the return of what you knew from the two sides, So the miracle of the Arabs will be at the beginning, and for those who came after them with the fee and the proof, and they are two ways to obtain science.After that, whoever wants to realize the miracle as the Arabs realize it, then what is necessary is that he does not work with the learning of the language and its literature and its characteristics until it is equal to the They were tempted and then looked after that in the relative of the Qur’an from the words of their language.And there was no era in a category that was destroyed by the understanding of the Arabic rhetoric, and it was aware of the miracle of the Qur’an, and they are the scholars of the rhetoric and the literature of the Arabic.Sheikh Abd al -Qahir said in the presentation of the miracles of the miracle: If he said: We have a way to the miracle of the Qur’an, as you have not said that any of the people of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge On the authority of their likeness, and leaving them to oppose him with the renovation of the determination, and the length of the brilliance for them with the miracle of it, and if it was the matter, and if it was the matter, if the matter was like that The creek is based on the Arabs and what the people are in it in it, and the ignorance did not come out with the tongue of the Arab The Muslims are among the choice of our Prophet, peace be upon him, that I was miraculously remaining on the face He wanted to know about it, and knowledge of it (P-350) is possible for those who seek it, and there is no meaning for the meeting of the miracle with the Qur’an, except that the description of it was the one who was in it.Al -Sakaki said in the presentation of the intention of some of the issues of the progress, saying: Those who define him with you to detailing, “I have shown in the old presenter, a consequence of the faces The miracle of the frequency and was in its rhetoric, and it was miraculous, where all of the recipients were excluded from what was achieved by what it achieved.
