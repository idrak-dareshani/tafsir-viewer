with him a sin or a denial that crossed (after) the meaning of (with) with the reference.The cruelty and cruelty are described by the bodies and describing the souls that express them with hearts.It violates it.And whether the harshness was a place for the destiny between these two meanings and the hearts, which is weak, or was it a place that is a place for the sake In the hearts, it is permissible, and it is correct, so this (P-563) was made until the truth was equal, and it became not needed to the consort, so the family is noticeable to the significance of the destiny, not the destiny of the destiny.With the origin of the place, and it was indicated on that kindness in his saying or more cruel, as it will come.And his saying is like a carpentry, it is similar to a piety to fulfillment of the will of the appearance of the likeness after the story of the case, expressing it with the right of the righteousness, and it is the same, and it is the same.Things in this

suspicion of the analogy to the way of the ritual in the way The tumor: (P-564) ؎ I seemed like the sun of the sun in the narration of the sacrifice ∗∗∗ and you photographed it, or you are in the eyes, so it is not for you, or for the sacrifice in any He is an adult on the saying of the carpentry, because it has a satellite if it is repeated the likeness of it as it was presented when we came to him when he said: It is permissible to be a compassion for the news, as it is like a carpentry, that is, it is the same as the carpentry, or it is stronger than the carpentry and the intended from
