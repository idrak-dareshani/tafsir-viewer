The Quranic researcher (P-590) If the victory of God and the conquest comes and you see the people enter the religion of God, and praise the praise of your Lord and seek forgiveness [Al-Nasr: 3].(If) the name of a vague time, whose approach is appointed by a sentence that is added to it.So (if) the name of a divorced time, then it is used for the future of the future.Therefore, the meaning of the condition is included, and the action that is added to the last formula is added to the past to benefit the verification, and it may be a consciousness as a whole.They collect them if it creates a capacity [Al -Shura: 29].It is used in the past time and then it is appointed that the sentence will fall after it in the past formula, and it is not included (if) the meaning of the condition, then it is for the sake of the condition.Learning, and if they saw a merchant or a fun, they will go to it [Friday: 11].And (if) here the condition of the condition is not referred to the existence of fulfillment with his saying: He praised the praise of your Lord [Victory: 3] and the ritual of the ritual and his numbers.And Al -Nasr: Benefit on the enemy.And the victory of God is punished by the overwhelming enemy.And the conquest: you have the country of enemy and its land; Because it is the opening of the door of the country, as it is the Almighty: Enter the door on them, so if you enter it, then you are overwhelmed [Al -Ma’idah: 23], and it will be the ritual They were descending with the lands that have reefs and gaps.The verse is aware that the conquest is removed in it, so it is another opening, and it is the opening of the Mecca as it feels that the adoption is in the words So shown shown [Al -Fateh: 1] so that God will forgive you for what you have given from your sin and what you are delayed and the blessing of you will be done to you and guide you.[Al -Fateh: 3].In addition (victory) to (God), you feel the greatest of this victory, and that it is a dear victory for the return, and God has taken care of his causes, and he did not leave the About her.And (came) used in a sense: he obtained and achieved a metaphor.(P-591) and the definition in (the conquest) for the covenant, and God has promised his Messenger ﷺ with it, without a time from that, the Almighty said: The one who imposed on you is the one who has been.And his saying: Let the mosque be the forbidden, if God wills, believers, the champion of your head Reading [Al -Fateh: 27].This verse was descended in the year of the Haddiyah, and that before we descended a surah if the victory of God came to all words.And the sayings of the interpreters have agreed from the predecessor, so whoever is after them that the conquest is mentioned in this surah is the opening of Mecca, except for a narrator from the authority Abbas is the opening of the ransoms and shortcomings, meaning: the fortresses.And it has It was the opening of the Mecca, which was the souls of all the Arabs, so Muslims were hiring it and knowing what the Qur’an referred to from the promise, and the family The Arabs are waiting for what the situation is between the people of Mecca and between the Prophet ﷺ and they recite their entry into Islam, so it will be made by Makkah, they say: He is a prophet.He was repeated that some of them repelled some of those who want to follow Islam, from the income in it and his attention to what will appear from the prevalence of Islam or the prevalence of evil.Al -Bukhari was removed from Amr ibn Salamah, who said: “When the conquest was the same as all the people in his peace to the Messenger of God ﷺ and the life of the life of the” They say: They called him and his people, so if they appear on them, then they are a prophet.And on the authority of Al -Hasan: When the Mecca was opened, the Arabs were accepted by some of them, and they said: As for when they were disbelieved in the people of the sanctuary, then they have no one in it.So the saying of the fans that the conquest is the opening of a makkah, it is evaluated that this surah will be after it, then it is open, and it is the one who said it.And it is impeded on the saying of those who say that it was the success of the conquest of two years, that the conquest may have passed, and the relationship is on the authority From God is another and the entry of people in Islam, and that is what was opened upon him after that and the entry of all Arabs in Islam in the year.And according to what was narrated from Ibn Omar (that it came down in the pilgrimage of the obedience), the relationship of a sentence (so praise the praise of your Lord [victory: 3]) on the condition of the condition of the condition Get, that is: (P-592) achieves what we have prepared for you from victory, conquest, and the generality of Islam in the country of the Arabs, and praise the praise of your Lord, and he is the one who said: It is an interpretation that has the meaning of the meaning, and it is not (if) what comes in the sense (may).And the vision is in his saying: I saw the people permissible to be scientific, that is: you taught the knowledge of the juice that the people enter the religion of God, with the people of God The Arabs and their domes and with those who bring their stations.It will be a sentence (they enter) in the place of the second verb for (you saw).It is permissible to be a visionary vision that he saw the faces of the Arabs of the Arabs who respond to the city, entering Islam and that is a nine year, and the nine seen, and the Prophet has seen He knew all of them in Islam in those who attended the stand in the Hajj of the obedience, so they were a hundred thousand of the different doors of the Arab The position of the situation from the people.And the religion of God is the Islam of His Excellency the Almighty: The religion of God is the Islam [Al -Imran: 19] and his saying: So establish your face of the religion of the one who is the fast of God.And the income in Religion: It is a slight of the utterance of testimony and the commitment of the rulings of the religion that is for that testimony.So the religion is like a house or a barrier on the way of the place, and it was symbolized by what is from the balance of the likeness of it, and it is the entry of it, and it is like that In terms of definition, it is an other bond.And the people: the name of a group that indicates a group of Adamin, and it was presented with the words of the Almighty: and among the people who says that we believe in God [Al -Baqarah: 8] With the blame, the covenant was carried out the one who said to them the people [Al -Imran: 173], and the gender was carried out that people have gathered you for you [Al -Imran: 173] People who say and be like, say I seek refuge in the Lord of the people [Al -Nas: 1].And the definition in this verse for the customs of the well -being, that is: all people who are dangerous to mind because of the will of the wills of the people who are in the way The debt of God with a guide (P-593) the view, the meaning: I saw many people or saw the Arabs.Ibn Attiyah said: Abu Umar ibn Abd al -Barr al -Nalliri - may God have mercy on him - said in the book of the accommodation in the chapter of Kharash al -Hudhali: “And the Messenger of God did not come Rather, everyone entered Islam after two and the sects, some of whom were offered, and among them who came to the expatriate, “Ah.Rather, the Arabs of Hijaz and the Najd and the Yemen are intended; Because from the Arabs of the Levant and Iraq, who did not enter Islam, and they are overwhelmed and washed in the sage of the Levant, and so is the slander and a dog of Iraq, so they were not.From them, except after the opening of the Levant and Iraq after the Messenger of God ﷺ, and the Messenger of God did not see them ﷺ they enter the religion of God as a visionary vision.It is permissible for God to be aware of that, if we make the vision a scientific.And Al -Fujawa: the collection of Fawj, which is the many groups, and it is presented with the words of the Almighty: this is a fool with you [p.59] in Surah, p.(Varies) as a result of a guarantee (they enter).And the sentence of praise with the praise of your Lord [Al -Nasr: 3] Answer (if) by adopting what you include in the sense of the condition, and the verb (praise) is the one who is working in (if) the text, To the answer; Because it is a creation.And the praise of praise with the praise of the accompanying accompanying that the praise is later to praise; Because the accompanying Ba in the sense of (with) is the same as (with) that it enters into the rumors, so the praise of God was on the victory of the victory and the conquest of the people in the From him he does not need the matter with his rhythm; Because the Messenger ﷺ was the one that he did it, but he needs to remind him of a special praise that he did not get before in his praise and with a special disbelief in no one who did not seek forgiveness Take advantage.It is permissible for the praise that is the mourning of it, the praise of it, and the admiration of God, the Almighty, what is not perplexed in the mind of one of you, for the sake of it It is used in admiration as the saying of the east: (P-594) ؎ By seeking forgiveness for the answer to seeking forgiveness for the custom of the Arabs in the presentation of praise before the question of the Hajj as the son of my father said: “If he praises the one who is upon you The praise is exposed to it, because the Messenger of God ﷺ did not give up on the praise of God, so I want to praise the praise of what I give to the blessed Islam.And the affection of the matter of seeking forgiveness of God is the Almighty with the praise with the praise, it requires that it is a matter of answer (if), and that he seeks forgiveness, he will be with the same Praise your Lord [Al -Nasr: 3], so he indicates that he is a special forgiveness; Because the expiation that is called for the forgiveness of the negligence, and the one who is commanded by it before, and it is from the authority of the Prophet ﷺ He said: “It is for me.God in the day and night a hundred times.A approach that was not before, which is the recklessness of God's meeting, and that his worldly life has been suspicious of the end, and the end of the acts of obedience and kinships He raised his grades with his Lord, and he did not remain until his Lord asked for the succession of what he offers for him from the preoccupation of some of the fortunes of Al -Dhuriyah, or from the life of the From the conditions of the nation, he misses it in the cause The Messenger of God ﷺ with the words of His Exalted: No Prophet had to have captives [Al -Anfal: 67] the verse, or from the harm of the human being like the sleep and the food that is short of the case They praise the night and the day, and they are not fool, so this was a sign of the death of the death of the Messenger of God ﷺ with his resignation from a life that carries the burdens of the message to the life of the angel.And the words from the way of the symbolic structure, and it does not contradict the will of the meaning that the matter is carried by the praise and the forgiveness of the meaning of the proliferation of the saying Some of the influential understanding of the companions on this meaning, and the same as my father, Bakr, Umar, and Abbas, and his son Abdullah and Ibn Mas'oud: Read it (P-595), the Prophet ﷺ on his companions, so they rejoiced, preached, and cried the servants, so the Prophet said to him ﷺ: What makes you cry, uncle?He said: I was given to you.He said: It is she said.” To me, my soul.You knew.He asks for forgiveness and repents to him, and he said: What do you say, Ibn Abbas?That is the mark of your death, and Omar said: What I know of it is what you say.God ﷺ He said: “A servant is good for God between the world and between what is with God, so he chose what God has glorified and exalted.Abu Bakr knew and said: So we have been in our soul, our mothers, our fathers, and our children, “Uh.His first of his being was when the surah was descended.The scouts and the second are the speech of the Prophet ﷺ in his illness.The Messenger ﷺ.It is imposed on the sin of God, and because praise is a praise for God for his year, and it is the performance of the servant with what is obligatory for him to thank the blessing, so it is a man He originated from his servant, so it is a gathering between the side of God and the goodness of the servant, and the exploitation is for the sake of the servant.He takes it on it.(P-596) and it is necessary Dahir, and he is your Lord for what is in the adjective (Lord) and added it to the guerrilla of the addressee from the gesture until the rule of that victory and the conquest and the entry of people in Islam is a blessing of God.This is the best of his midst, so that he is a generosity of him and his care for him, and he is the one who is kind to the Lord, because it is the same The words were ended with his saying (and forgiven him) and he narrated (that the Prophet ﷺ was in his readers standing at him (and forgive him) and then he will be forgiven).
