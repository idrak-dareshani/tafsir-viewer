mercy Before him to disagree with the two wages, because the verse was before it in the discipline of the believers with the abandonment of Jews, and this verse is for the goodness And the direction of the appropriateness between the two verses is a back of the union of fate, and because the preacher of insults and harm is envy.This verse is a return to the revelation of the reason that called for the abuse of Jews from faith in the Qur’an when it was said to them: The one who has been forgiven to whom they are grabbed with what was revealed to them, but it is the envy of what was revealed to the Prophet and the Muslims from the best, so he explained the evidence of the denial And holding their debts, by saying it, say, why do you kill the Prophet of God [Al -Baqarah: 91] And their

inclusiveness of this judgment of Jews and Christians with a gift to what comes from the remembrance of the ruling of the rituals of the one who said: Paradise is nothing but who was a gift or Christians [Al -Baqarah: 111] The verses.He warned about his saying that those who disbelieved from the people of the book without the people of the book that they did not follow their book because their books are commanded to command them With the righteous prophets on their effects and in the mourning and the Gospels, many places in which the covenant takes on that.They disbelieved in what they had been written by their books, and this is the words of the words between the preaching of the Christians with the preaching of the Jews.And when what was required by the situation was the one who said it was the one who disbelieved from the people of the book, it may be deluded, as the Bianh is a feet, and that the disbelievers are not the same as the people His saying, “nor the participants”, like the beacon, have composed to him to be a gathering of judgment between all Whoever prevented the mosque of God to mention in it his name [Al -Baqarah: 114] and the gesture reads to be revealed by the tightening of the Zay, and the abstinence of the abandonment of The fall, as the Qur’an descended as a successful to see its memorization, understanding, and writing, and to facilitate the costs on the rulings of the rulings.Ibn Katheer and Abu Omar read it with a slight Al -Zai is also a darkening, and that is on the authority of their exile and their attachment related to the divorce of the Qur’an, whether it was a payment or a successful.And the goodness of the grace and the best, the jungle said, “I fell on the best of you, and he wanted the prophecy here.His saying, and God is devoted to his mercy and his saying, and God selects his mercy from those who give a kindness to what he would like to guarantee that they will not be.And the mercy is the same as the good that is revealed to them and that is a combination of those who are granted to them that what we have revealed to them is the mercy of them and the meaning Other than that, because the origin of the choice and the specialization is due to this meaning, I mean making the judgment a special public, whether it is only one or more or more, and it is a good thing.In it if he is presented to him, or he will be delayed from him, that is, whoever creates his choice with mercy.Witches are the will, and when the will of God is attached to the want and the knowledge of his knowledge (P-654), his will, that is, his will is running on the one How to know the knowledge of God, it is one of the attachments of divine knowledge with the extent of the testee on what is empty, and the words were presented to them when you say: With his mercy, whoever knows that he is true of it, especially the mercy that is intended from the prophethood, for God is allocated from it from his creation, and he will be able A righteous breakfast to receive the revelation, something, he said, and when he reached the most severe, and it is a matter of wisdom and knowledge.The prophethood is a result of acquisition, because God creates the prophethood whoever wants it to it because of the danger of its command with the disagreement of other than the virtue, so it is like the one who is able And otherwise, the Lord of a pasture was good and the Lord is ignorant, who has become a scholar of capacity and acquisition, and with this, then it is imperative that it be of the number And the care of God Almighty with His servant.And when the supplies of the mercy of the mercy from the prophecy, without it, it is not a way for people folded with the righteousness Except with what he taught and his ruling, his ruling was accompanied by the understanding of the addressees.And his saying, and God, is the great preference, that the best offends is to give good and treating with mercy, and alert him to the obligation of the goodness of the good.And the desire for it to seek the grace of the grace and the mercy, and he will be abandoned from the tinkers and the hidden ones, and it will be made with the virtue and the obedience, so that it is possible that it is the one who loves it, and it is good "Know God in prosperity, knowing you in the severity."
