The Quranic researcher (P-259) and from the people who says that we believe in God and the last day and what they are in the believers, this is another partner, and he is a team that has the phenomenon of faith, and he is the one who does not The evil, or the one who is inhabited by the inhabitants, and all of it is the defamation of faith as a lie.In the appropriate remembrance between the two of the two wives, it is not required in the likeness of it except for the occasion between the two of the two of the two.Al -Tafsani in the explanation of the scouts, and the master said that it is a great origin in the section of kindness, and many of them have noticed him, so I have been forced by the matter in the place It is taken from the saying of the scouts and the story of those who escaped from the last of which is given to the story of those who disbelieved as the sentence is overwhelmed by the sentence of the one It is not from the compassion of the sentence on the sentence.The investigator, Abd al -Hakim, said: This is what the Sakaki has delegated, that is, in the conditions of the chapter and the connection, and the owner of the scout was unique.He knew that the preceding verses from the righteousness of the Qur’an in the Qur’an with the remembrance of those who are guided by their sons: I descended to you [Al -Baqarah: 4] “Until the last of what was presented, and he was transferred from the praise to them to the remembrance of their additions, and they are the disbelievers who want them, and they want the disbelievers.The Samaid had thought that those who showed faith inside the saying of those who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3], so the poem was not a question about the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a question about Faith, and the evil, or others, who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are intended here with the evidence of his saying, and if they meet those who believed, they said: And he ranked and described it in terms of he does not take care of his presence and his goodness is to mention his command to the two sides, and for that he brought this sentence to the one who is not.It is necessary for it and not an excitement for its signs in the souls of the Samaids, with the disagreement of a sentence that those who disbelieved both are upon them [Al -Baqarah: 6] Leave it to the kindness of it.It was prescribed after the believers, he was anticipating the Samaid, so the Samaid was like the questioners about it, so the chapter came to the Biany.And his saying, and from the people, is a submitted news, not referred, and it may be prevented that the news is like a few seriousness, because if the beginning is indicative of the same as the same, or the same, or not, or not People were about the beginning that it is from the people or in the people other than glorified with the difference of your saying: the green from the people, that is, not from (P-260) the angels, then it is the good The news is of their saying from people in the direction She congratulates me with the plan of the judiciary: In people who have given her hearts to a successor, then he forbade what he wanted and permitted that the intention is the disappointment The hadith will be caught by defamation or a shortage, and from the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “There are no people who are involved in conditions that are not in the book of God.Pupping because in his progress alert him to the wondrous of what will be mentioned, and a distortion of the knowledge of what the luxury is fulfilled, and if it is more likely to be the last Because of the knowledge of the knowledge that what the speaker mentioned is only from a human being, such as the saying of Moses bin Jabir al -Hanafi: And among the men is a year It is a sign of people who are authorized to marvel, and if the news is the benefit of this act, this act is from people, so that the addressee does not think that the people are not.The intention is that if it was, as he said, it would not have been for the subordination to be increased, but it was his delay, until it was decided by the matter that is the illusion that this is the beginning of the beginning.This recovery is brought up, and that is where it is not for the appearance of the news in the formation of the speaking about it from the individuals of the people who are great.The addressee is like your saying: One of the men is the one who wore a parliament, you want the news about the people who are called by the two persevered from (Lamtun), or where it is the one.The saying of Abdullah ibn al -Zubair in the conquest of the zai and the break of the B: and in the people if you inherit your tables and the exaltation of the earth from the house of fry The speaker does not find someone to pray if he cuts him, so he remembers the people and the like in the same way as this and responds to the origin of the news, and the news of the news is here The starting is not a specialization in it.And if you know that his saying from the people is authorized that the one who talks about them will be consistent in their affairs, a stalled story and a state of heinous, as it is not the case of their remembrance, because it is not the case Where the speaker is inspired to be expressed by its descriptions and in that from the fact that the hypocrisy and its affliction is a great matter, and it was replied in the matter We are aware of them in them, their misfortune, their misfortune, and their misfortunes (P-261), and their dreams of their dreams, their ignorance, and the exaltation of that, and that is in the case of the case and the case The rituals of the pictures while they are free with that, because the plan in which they are taught is a many sheets of a nose, as the hypocrisy collects the lies, the forehead, and the affliction, and the affliction, Silkok, bite, loser of life, disappearance of trust, enmity of the companions, and asleep.As for the falsehood, it is a back Take the view of all of what is possible, and the opinion of the opinion is because that is a sign of weakness in the mind, as there is no reason for that, but the ritual is that it is not for you.With it, and the badness of Silkuk is that the hypocrisy is hidden by the adjectives of the slander, and the defamatory attributes if they do not appear, it is not possible for the one who is not a friend, nor for the truth.On her owner, she remains as she is and increases the height of time until she becomes an kingdom whose disappearance is excused, but as for the stomach, because he is the most likely to be in the affairs of the hypocrisy Pleasure, and the loss of life is because the mind is behaves to irrigate the conditions of hypocrisy and what is required to be with the people and the erection of the tricks to hide this and in that and in that and that is what is in that The job is what is found, and the disappearance of trust is because the people, if they look at him, misbehave them, then they do not trust anything that falls from it, even if it is true, and if it is a matter He knew that this is a creation of his friend, who was afraid of his treachery, and he warned him, so he led to his enmity, and as for the grace of the virtue, the result of all of it.And his saying has referred to the Almighty and what they are believers to the lies, and his saying is deceived by the affliction and the cheese, and its saying and what they deceive, except for themselves: They feel [Al -Baqarah: 9] to his stomach, and his saying in their hearts is sick [Al -Baqarah: 10] to the bad Silkuk, and his saying, and God increases them.[Al -Baqarah: 10] And his saying said: “We are reconciled [Al -Baqarah: 11] to the loss of the age in other than what is intended, and it was said that they said that we are with you [Al -Baqarah: 14] confirmed that you are a little.In them, and his saying, when their merchants have forgotten [Al -Baqarah: 16] until their command was not noticeable for acceptance at their companions, and his saying is deaf, with a thick of the heart of God.Including the guest of them and will come to detail for this, and collect it with the words of the Almighty in their hearts.It is a compensation for my people, who is the gathering of humanity, and they compensated for the people of people by adding the gossip and the widening of the proportions, indicating this of this Ubayd ibn al-Urabs al-Asadi addresses the woman of Qais: (P-262) The loads are on the authority of the safe people and then they deleted their thumbs Surprisingly, as they said, “Luke” in “Al -Awla”, which is the Zabdah, and the adultery may be deleted the thunder of people when the entry of it is not overwhelmed by the difference of the deceased It was widely deleted in it and it was said that people are collected and it is from a crowd that came on the weight of an act of effective fulfillment of fulfillment like a shadow of shadow, and the anchors of the gathering The light and the adultery of a little effective in the crowd in the words of the Arab The imams of the language with a group of what he returned from, so he mentioned his maternal uncles in the book of Yus and Ibn al -Sakit and Ibn Berri.The one who was eight than eight of them was used to collect in three verses that are attributed to the merits and the correctness that it is for the breasts of the virtues of his sins, then the sake of many The eighty words are other words until they were ended up to four and twelve gathering, which was mentioned by Al -Shahhab Al -Khafaji in the explanation of the dirham of the gauge and the male of its greatness in the grace of it.Al -Baydawi, which is one of the knowledge of the language, go back to it, if you will.It was said that what came with this weight is the entire names of the scouts, and this gathering is a human being, a human being, or a person, and all of it is a derivative of the one who is a derivative of the one who is a derivative He wrapped up and forgotten.And the definition of people for the people, because what I have learned from its use in their words support the will of the gender and it is permissible for the sake of the covenant to be the one They mention them in his saying that those who disbelieve [Al -Baqarah: 6] or the people whom the Prophet guides ﷺ and those who are Muslims in this matter, and “who” is the authority In his saying, his saying, and what they are believers, and the form of collection.And what is mentioned in his saying, and from the people who says, etc., a third section, compared to the two sections that are presented to the Mattam, between the whole, if the one is the most beautiful, and if it is the same The whole characteristics are agreed in the sentence, so the face of making the hypocrites does not suspect, with the disbelievers, with them because they are intended to divide the characteristics.Rather, the Qur’an was confined to their sayings on their saying: We believed in God and the last day.With the fact that they appeared faith in the prophet ﷺ, as a summary of that the first is the beginning of the struggles, all of which are because whoever does not believe in a single Lord that does not reach the faith with the faith, for the faith is with the faith.The belief is reconciled and it is the origin of the work, and the second is the palace and the emitter in all of them, in which the work of the working situation.Or they are (P-263) who are confused about their saying on this saying because they are for them in infidelity, they cannot be able to remember the faith of the faith.The perpetrators, and they will be rejected by the remembrance of God and the last day, as a matter of confessing and preserved on their disbelief, because they are more and the most of them.And in expressing (he says) in the same way as this place is a gesture until that is not the preservation of the facts because the storyteller about others if he does not comment on the one who is commented With the words, he says that is that it is not a picnic to be able to do it, or that the speaker is lying in that, so it is a gift for what they say, and what they are, and what they are, and what they are.With the believers in the position of the situation, from a guarantee, he says any saying this saying in the event that they are not believers.And the verse referred to a group of The disbelievers, who are the hypocrites who were from the people who were raised and some of them are those who have appeared to Islam and the rest of them from the Arabs who are in the face of them Malik that the hypocrites who were succeeded in the conquest of a period of time and faithful, and it was known from their names, Abdullah ibn Abi Bin Salawal And the grandfather ibn Qais, and the son of Ibn Qashir, and the son of Swid, in which they descended in it The most disobedient is from the children of Zariq Halif to Jews, as in the chapter of magic from the book of the medicine from the authenticity of Al -Bukhari, and Al -Akhnas Abi Bin Shariq Al -Thaqafi was the one who appeared to be the same قَوْلِهِ تَعالى ومِنَ النّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ [البقرة: 204] وزَيْدُ بْنُ اللُّصَيْتِ القَيْنُقاعِيُّ ووَدِيعَةُ بْنُ ثابِتٍ مِن بَنِي عَمْرِو بْنِ عَوْفٍ, ومُخَشِّنُ بْنُ حِمْيَرٍ الأشْجَعِيُّ Those who were stabilized by the Muslims, from the invasion of Tabuk and it was said that Zaid ibn al -Lisa was repented and good condition, and it was said, and it is not a rough, and it is a rough and the one who is afraid of God, and he is the one who is afraid of God, and he is the one who is afraid of God, Al -Yamamah, and in the book of the lighter of the son of the son of Hazm who mentioned the people of Mu'tab ibn Qashir al -Awal A way that is invalidated by this thinking without doubt, but it appears from him one day that indicates the weakness of his faith, so they decorated him with hypocrisy, for he is the one who said: We were killed by us [Al -Imran: 154] narrated by Al -Zubayr ibn Al -Awam.Among the hypocrites, the father of your forgiveness is one of the sons of Amr ibn Awf, and his hypocrisy appeared when the Messenger of God al -Harith was killed.The Messenger of God (P-264) commanded the killing of my father, and Salam bin Amir killed him.He pardoned you and said a poetry that is exposed to the prophet, which Amir bin Uday al -Khatami said to him, and the Messenger of God ﷺ “He does not turn in it.” Abraq was an argument that gave the companions of the Messenger of God and witnessed one of them, and among them is a trick of Bin Hatib, and he has been Muslim and returned from the people of Badr, and among them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was Jewish, so he called the Judaism to the ruling of the Prophet, so he prevented the human being and asked the trial to Kaab ibn al -Asharf, and this is the one who killed him and his story in his saying Those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you [Women: 60] in Surah Al -Nasi.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the hypocrites on the covenant of the Messenger of God were three of the men, one hundred and seven of the women, but those who escaped from the sins and the people of the And he gathered them upon him, the servant of God, the son of Abi, a envy and a slave of Islam, because it was a family that was raised after the sacrament of the wars of them, and the wars of them were between them, and they were among them.They disappeared to make him a king on them and fanaticize him with the nerves.Saad ibn Ubadah said to the Prophet ﷺ in the hadith of Al -Bukhari: Pardon him, O Messenger of God and forgive God Al -Baira is that they disobey him with the nerves.Their shame of the Hijaz, and the Arabs are a follower of the lords, and that is the most disbelieving and hypocrisy of the Arabs.After them, like their attributes, they are later to them, while God mourned them, and this is the meaning of the saying of Salman Al -Farisi in the interpretation Ibn Attiyah, the meaning of his saying, that they did not lend, but they would come from every time, it means that Salman does not deny the evidence of this description of the people The intention is not seen from the verse, the restriction of the authority in them, but in those who come after them.And his saying and what they are with the believers are coming in the negation of their saying in the fatal sentence, and he did not come to the adultery Because of themselves, the past was the one that was subjected to the urgency of it, the faith is achieved as it went on with the fragrance and its promises with commitment; Because the origin is not to change (P-265), who does not seek the obligation of how it is, and the debt is it, and when I want the denial of faith from them, his denial was not in the past, and it is not necessary in the past.The ritualization was his saying and what they are believers, indicating that he was avoiding them at the time; Because the name of the actor is a truth in the time of the situation and that negation is obligated to be overlooked in the past by the first So they told them their words because when they saw the Muslims, they demanded the knowledge of their faith.That is, the sayings of us have not come from a faith from them, so the fulfillment of them in the exile action is recorded for their lies, and this is from the citizens of the perpetrators between the sentence A validation of the boundary of the benefit of the ultimate progressive, and if they were concerned about the alerts on the running of that base when they mentioned the perpetrators between the rituals and the rituals between The suffering was written by the owner of the scouts here with the words of the significance.If you said, the servant of God, Bin Sa`d ibn Abi Sara, was Islam, then he wore and then claimed after his response He was writing the Qur’an and that the Prophet was bored with him ﷺ “dear wise”, for example, so he wrote it, “Forgiving, merciful”, for example, and the opposite, and this is from the faith of the faith.The hypocrites who believe after, so the answer is that this is the transfer of the historians and they are not accustomed to their words in the same way as this time, not, and the mother of the authority The sentence of what the revolutionaries have resurrected on Uthaman and the historians of the historians in it are known that they have received them from the two years and their feet, and the evidence of this is that this It is correct for him to enter the doubt in the debt, and if the servant of God was tried, this is the knowledge of God, His Messenger, because it is not permissible for the sake of the Messenger, and the Messenger is not.Tabalg on the fact that it is a passion for the mind, if he wanted to confirm the religion, the most abstaining of it was to deprive it other than that, that this is what he said, and he said that he said: Then in religion, it is not true because he is accused of the purpose of the release of his response to those who are partners in Mecca, and you have learned from the eighth The intention is in the verses of the Qur’an on the memorization of its memorization and the reading of the Prophet ﷺ, but he was commanding his writing to the purpose of the bound by the Muslim, if the Muslims needed, and if they need it, and if they need it, and if the Muslims need it, and if the Muslims need it, and if the Muslims need it, and if the Muslims need it The argument fell into the return of the Qur’an that was written from the Qur’an except in the time of Abu Bakr, and it was not transmitted that the memorization of the Qur’an and found a disagreement between the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the right Abdullah bin Abi Sara, was not alienated with the writing of the revelation, so he was writing with him others.(P-266) The faith denied them with their saying: We believe.A clear indication that the name of faith is believing that the region is indicative of faith, it may be a liar, so it is not that of the penetration of faith, and the faith in the urban is the one who does not He knows that from religion is a fierce knowledge, in which it is fixed with a piece of sever The obligatory for every Muslim is a disgrace between the special scholars of religion and the general of Muslims, in which there is no conflict in which we have been transferred to faith in the city to the one who is a matter The authentic hadith on the authority of Omar, “Jabriel came and asked the Prophet ﷺ about faith, and he said: Faith is that you believe in God and his angels, his books, and his messenge It is better and evil." The nation’s scholars have disagreed in what faith is what is and they also shed the truth of Islam, and we are gathered by the spread of the one who is from them with what is for the sake Their doctrine in a short sentence.And we have returned the separation of their sayings in this to five sayings: The first saying is the saying of the brought out of the scholars of the nation.Faith is the belief that is not called, and it is not that, and it is its linguistic name, so he will not be transferred from its meaning, because the original is the nodd of the transmission, except that it is made by the truth Between her religion, and the generalization of public memorization in some of his individuals is to be transferred to him from the meaning of the linguist, and he prevailed in the tongue of the two laws on the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.One of the people of the ones is a lot of many, but it is a lot of many.From that is the hadith of Jabriel the advanced and the hadith of “Sa`d that he said, O Messenger of God: What you have about so is that I will see it as a believer.Islam is not from the concept of faith because Islam is Islam and the bodies of the bodies without the heart and the evidence of separation between them the language and the hadith of Jabril, and the saying Say: You did not believe, but they said: “Al -Hujurat: 14].He agreed with what he says, then if he asks about Islam, then the Prophet shows him ﷺ that Islam: a testimony that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God and the prayer of the prayer The house for those who were able to be able to a path.Ibn Rashd is that his Islam with his heart, so if he died, he died as a believer, and he (P-267) is a distant taking, and you will know that your money is said to be with his disagreements.He also attributed this to Al -Ash'ari, the imam of Al -Harimin said in the guidance, which is the satisfaction with us.And with it Al -Zuhri said from the two followers.The second saying is that faith is the criticism of the heart and the height of the tongue with the two testimonies of the acknowledgment of that belief, so the faith is a long -term With a law, unless the region is joined to him, and this is transferred from Abu Hanifa, and the nawyeh attributed it to the jurisprudence of jurisprudence, the two speakers, and the one who is spoken, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And the Marisi human.Al -Khufaiji attributed it to the investigators of the Ash'ari and his choice of Ibn al -Arabi.I said, and I do not think that between this and the first saying is a difference, but we look at every one who was said to the side.Their expressions until the dispute exacerbates them, even if the dispute has fallen between them in that the restriction is against the belief, is it a result in what is between the one who is from the one and from the one who is from the one who is from Al -Baydawi said in interpretation and money to the second, and it is taken from their words that if the declaration was left, there was no arrogance, it was a survivor, such as the other, the disbeliever, the disbeliever, and the absence He communicated with his death.And take the release of faith in Islam and the opposite in the positions of the book and the Sunnah.[Al -Dhariyat: 36] And in the hadith of the servant of Abd al -Qais that the Prophet ﷺ said to them: “I command you with a quarter and that you forbid you from the fourth faith in God The Messenger of God and the prayer of prayer, “etc., and this is a single news.The condition of Islam.The third saying is the saying of the predecessor of the companions and the followers that faith is a certainty, a saying and action, so they have their condition of their condition and their coming in the light They did not excess of faith, the conditions that are shortened in compliance, and attributed that to the money, the shower of the revolutionary, and the sons of Bin Ayniyah, Al -Awazi, Ibn Ibn Jar.And the peacock, Mujahid, and Ibn al -Mubarak and al -Bukhari, and attributed to the son of Masoud and Hudhafah, and with it, Ibn Hazm said from al -Zahiriya and touching it with the family of the hadeeth.The hadiths, and that are the same as the increase and the lack of faith in the increase in the increase of the aspirations and its lack of its saying to the Almighty to increase faith with their faith [Al -Fath: 4] etc.In the hadith, faith came with a few seventy people, and that was referred to that acceptance (P-268) for virtues.And on that, his saying ﷺ “The adulterer does not adultery when he weighs while he is a believer.” And we say about Malik that it increases and does not decrease.Ibn Bajal said, and this does not violate the saying of your money that faith is believing and it does not increase and does not decrease because the belief is the first of the homes of faith and is obligatory for the sake He has the continuation of his homes, but he wanted these imams the response to the legacy in their saying that faith is a saying without the work of uh.And they did not follow them on the late ones because they have seen an explanation of the full faith, and there is no conflict in it, but the conflict is in the origin of the name of faith and the first of the paths of success More speakers are more than saying: Faith increases and decreases and tried to say that he is the Almighty to increase faith [Al -Fath: 4] that the intention is the same Checking.The righteous saying is the saying of the Kharijites and the disgraceful, that faith is a certainty, a delegate, and action as it came in the third saying, except that they wanted from their saying the truth From the group of three, if one of them is disturbed by the hero of faith, and they have a decree of his heroes by decreasing The obligatory work is not an unnecessary, or a member of the evidence, only related to the shadows of some antiquities with the timers because of its similar ones.As for the Kharijites, they said that your wickedness is something that is not a believer, and it is immortal in the fire.For all sins, they have brights.As for that, such as the delegates and the trap, it is not necessary to leave them with immortality, as a Muslim does not say that the tenderness of the Sunnah and the delegates must be disbelieved in the infidelity Doing the bars.And the exhortation of the Kharijites said that some of the obligations are disbelievers, but its disbelief is the disbelief of a blessing, not a blessing.As for the disgraced, they agreed and agreed that the tanks have a luck of faith, except that they are their immorality in their quadruples, and the doctrine of the disgraceful in this place, so that it is the place, Their feet, which is the most famous of them, is that the disobedient is in the fire, but it is not described as disbelief or faith, and they described it as immoral (P-269) Special, as well as the son of Hazm in the book of the chapter, and the son of Bin Ata al-Ghazal said that the greatness of the great is a hide A disbelief, so he separates the saying of the Kharijites and the saying of the rejected, and Amr ibn Ubaid agreed with it.This is the question that is in its cause.And this is all of them, but they were forced or forced the transfer from them in the name of the house between the two homes, so the imam of the two guidance said that they said that they are the one who said: The reward of obedience is loosened, even if it is more, and it is not referred to that it requires the immortality in the fire, and that is the reward for the imbalance in the explanation of the scouts and in the intentions, and he said: The two homes are obligatory for the immortality, but rather the house is proven to be released by the name of the name of the disbelief and to conduct the rulings of the believers on its owner in the apparent case in the case of the case The disobedience is committed as the stretch, and it will be killed.And he said in the intentions and the same in the guidance: The deceased has the disagreement of the famous.The entry of the fire if its punishment increases on the reward of obedience, then if the obedience is raised on the calamities, you have the dates The uniform is a single majority that overlooks its many obediences, and there is no way to the dumping of these quantities, but rather it will be made to the knowledge of God.If you are equal to the good and the sixties, then they have been forced in that This is the place of the house between the two homes.And Ibn Hazm said in the chapter on the group of them, in which the human beings and the deaf people are that those who are equal to his goodness and his goodness are from the people of the nations and the people of the nick Then they enter the paradise and those who are worse, then it is permissible for him to be more likely from sins.With an intercession.This requires that these are not seen.Some of the dismissal were transferred from the house that the house between the two homes is not paradise or fire, except that the balance in the intentions is the mistake of this one, and that is in the evil.The owner of the scout decided the truth of the house between the two homes in beautiful words, so he said in the interpretation of his saying, and what is misleading of it is only from Al -Fasher: [26] The project that is outside the command of God with the adoption of the great, and it is the descent between the two homes, that is, between the believing and infidels.And they said that the first of those who limited him to this limit is the father of Hudhafah and the son of the son of Ata, and his universe between him between that his ruling is the rule of the believer in that he is the one who is inherited and he is not.It is buried in the graves of the Muslims (P-270), and it is like the infidels in the defamation, the cursing, and the mortality from it, and it will be resigned, and that it is not accepted for him.It is mentioned in it that he is immortal in the fire and stated in his saying, and whoever kills a believer is deliberate, so his reward is hell in it [Women: 93] in Surah Al -Nasid Blacks are without a repentance in the fire.I said: The Shan was that the conduct of Islamic rulings on him in the world requires that it is not immortal, as it is not reasonable that the rulings of the Muslims are made upon him For the sake of the separation of the disbelief, as the Muslim is a Muslim who is one of the immortality in the fire, so how is the adoption of some of the sins, due to the contradiction of the abandonment of Islam.It is a disobedience, and the sincere repentance may be delayed, and it may not be obtained, so they are obligated, and the Kharijites are obligated to prepare for the sacrifice Say.On the authority of this, which rests the disobedience on the contradiction of the nakedness of religion, as the Muslims relate to it because of the number of the beneficial that they converted to the sake of the sake of the sake of it The wondrous of the wonders is that this saying is from a sane, a grace of a world, then it is more surprising that they will follow their followers on it And how a fair scientist does not illuminate in them the mortals of the mothers, so he will reform it or interpret it as he wanted to be crowded with the scholars of the Sunnah from the chest of the nation.The fifth saying said that the Karamiya said.The belief is the saying, so it is not involved in the name of faith.We have been subjected to the two testimonies, even if his mind does not occupy the intention of their signs, but it is satisfied with it that he does not guarantee the disagreement of their signs, and this is not the same In it.Or they wanted to run upon him in the phenomenon of the judgments of the believers with the fact that the calamity does not deny that those who believe in the disagreement of what we are in the way of the martyr In the interpretation of the pride that the Demuhasqi al -Damshaqi and the agreement of the Kamariya.These are the Islamic words of the Islamic teams in the name of faith.And I say a word that is more biased about the bias to a victory, which is that the disagreement of the Muslims at the first steps of their path and the first position of the positions of the positions The days after the days, and the numbers are punished after the nations, it is considered a scientific shortage that does not remain.And do not know me after this day, I am satisfied with it.There is no crime that the project is the first of what was required of people faith and Islam to come out of that (P-271) of the hubs of the evil and the contradiction of this debt, so if it is obtained by that For the acceptance of the good and the law on those niches, it was in the receipt of that on the calculation of its recovery, as a decoration for its lives in this world.Faith and Islam are the original ones that send them the good, and they are the one between the people of the people of misery and the people of goodness as a limit that does not accept a difference and does not doubt that It will be varying as God Almighty said, then what is the right after the misguidance [Yunus: 32], and no one claims that the concept of faith is the concept of Islam, and he will be seen.How and the Messenger made it easy for that sitting when he knees.What those who claimed only a people have been narrowed, and they wanted to be the one who is more than the two things, so that the one who is in this person who is only the two things and that is in the face of the two things, and that is clear The materials of the book and the Sunnah in one of the two words, in the denominator of the speech of those who solved the two of the two, so the first and second said.The obligation to be forced by the words in the distinction between the truth of faith and the truth of Islam are two things: one of them is that the Muhammad al -Muhammad was called to the belief in the belief of the God And with the truth of Muhammad ﷺ and the faith in the unseen, and called for the region with what indicates the crops of this belief in the soul of the believer, because the belief is not known The Messenger is convinced of one of what he thinks that he has obtained this belief, except that he is recognized by his briefing if he is fierce.The second is that the believers who have admired the call of the Messenger, and their oppressors were not In violation of their opponents, as there was no Muslim who dominates the disbelief, so the meaning of faith was a comparison of the meaning of the meaning of Islam, and they are true And Muslims, then when the hypocrisy is after the migration, the pilgrimage to the separation between the state of those who described the faith and peace and between the state The disbelief is a separation of warning and alerting, not with the awareness and the distinction of the descriptions, so the Qur’an and the words of the prophet are running in the majority The universal Muslims between the two meanings and may be conducted on the observance of the disadvantaged conditions when the need is to be alert Our Islam, and when faith enters into your hearts [Al -Hujurat: 14], and as in “the saying of the Prophet to whom he said to him, what you have about so -and -so, and God, I do not see him as a believer.” (P-272) The meaning of faith is the meaning of the belief that it must be met, and the meaning of Islam has the meaning of the emergence of the woman, that it is the same as the same as the one who said: Muslims, Muslims, believers, and believers [Al -Ahzab: 35] the verse.Is there a doubt that the project has been required of the people of faith and Islam to the inner of the other world of the world of paradise and fire, because God Almighty is the Almighty to God The two people are created that they would live, if they create them, but God wanted to support the two worlds, the worldly and the other, and made the world of the world.To qualify to the other world of the world to be attached to the angels, so God made the parties to stop the people of the deeds of the verbs that they will be released from the reactions The spoil is for their breakfast, and God wanted to keep the system of this world, too, to remain good for the extent of the meters of God to a period that he wanted, and he was granted to the people of the people.And the income to its barrier, that entry called faith and in Islam to the extension of their obtaining in the fields of the reality The purification of their own lying in the acceptance of the acceptance of what is drawn from the sins of the kindness of the same.Industry with the ends of the integrity or an obsession.That is the work of all places, ending, and denying.This is the end of which the caravans are dispersed, except that the people of their people are not lost in it, the origin that they entered does not decrease.Before faith, which comes with the greatness of good, he exceeded the one who has been without it, and the one who is all in the amount of energy is the lake, in which the law does not come from the good Those who are named after the believers and Muslims, and those of those who are the guardianship In that Amr ibn Ma’ad is raising the days of the days, he did not see the end of the drink of wine and says: God is upset, he said: Do you have been finished [Al -Ma’idah: 91] and we said.He has indicated his jihad on the day of Qadisiyah on his faith and on the verge of a lot of the parts of his Islam, so is it considered whether and the disbelievers are in the shadow of the world.The tanks are the second of the second consequences after faith and Islam, because it is the integrity of the intended, and it does not dislike in these two means, as it is in the second code, and it is not.Experience.And what is supported by this is the best of the support and it was mentioned in the chapter in the hadith of “Muazah ibn Jabl, that the Prophet ﷺ was sent to the Yemeni, so he said to him that you will come from Call them until they testify (P-273) that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.God imposed on them five prayers on every day and night.When he separated them, because the prayer for the truth must be a payment, otherwise it was satisfied with his survival on part of the disbelief, and if there is a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment with a moment The debt is satisfied with the disbelief, and it is from the disbelief, so how does he command his infallible skywood from being approved by one of the righteousness, so the third said.And there is no suspicion in it that the reward for reward and punishment for the estimated alkalis and al -Jawarehi al -Qulbiyah, the matter that does not obtain anything from the one who is not the one without it without it All of him must be whoever did not believe and did not give up in the fire because he does not get anything from him From the absence of what is made in its ways, its reward is destined to be overburdened and the punishment is destined to leave it, and it is not necessary to dislike in this other God is the wise, the wise man, who did not believe and did not convert Both men are in torment and immortality, and they remain a good for every bond of disobedience in staying in Islam if the one who escapes for his sake of Islam is in all of him Fire, even if he wants to repent on the day, and then one of the nation is denied that the nation is not devoid Before the repentance, a disbelief, so does this sane say that the nation is in that state, describing the disbelief, and there is no sane person who is obligated after he hears it, so he hears it It is taken from the vicinity His exalted say, and what God would have lost your faith [Al -Baqarah: 143] The prayer means, that God called the prayer with faith, and if only the work of faith is what is called, so that it is so that it is that From faith and Islam, then the loyal and fifth saying of three sayings for those who are in fairness in the people of the Kamal.Then on the scholar who is absent from the purposes of the project and its visits to separate the positions of its speech, for it is the place of the prestige, and it And warning, and from the status of learning and investigator, and he returns every and responding from the provisions of the project to his delicate mourning, and the inconvenience is not attracted to the exhibitions, so that the argument is attracted, so it is not attracted, so it is not attracted.One of what was mentioned in the descriptions of the descriptions, and proves one of those descriptions that are in the context of praise (P-274), as it is described by all of it, so if it is all.It is one of it, and it is one of it, and that is the same as the one for the rest of it.It is not an indication of the fact that one of them is installed and strengthened by their entire group Teaching and clarification, so it does not want to give birth to his saying: a cheerful arising from a few hopelessness and surrounded by the sins of the evil, It is interpreted to atone for the Muslims and the Islamic university, but rather, but it looks at the provisions of the project, a surrounding view until it is not from it.Things and his attendance, but his ruling will be in the question as the rule of alive.As for the question of forgiveness from the disobedience, it is a question that relates to our abundance and is not from it, and the poets have expanded in it and others are narrow and the command of it, and it is a narration of it The one who has been informed of the legs is the advertisement of the promise and the return, otherwise the Zujir is a conflict in the cold of the union.The dispute in it from the truth to the metaphor, and it is not surprising that the mourning of the costumes is like the saying of the Kharijites, the exhortation, and the disgraceful, and it is not forbidden from the sake What is meant, or the saying of his feet is that of the accustomed interpretation, as if I was flashing, the mantle of their sins, I take the rituals of the ash.
