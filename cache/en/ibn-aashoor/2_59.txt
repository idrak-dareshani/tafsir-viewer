story of information that includes their books, which is that the sons of Israel, when they were broken by Varan descended in the city of Qadish, so they became the same as the land of the panties that are the sacred land that God has prepared for the children They were from Egypt, so Moses sent two ten men to be angry, the land of the soles of every way a man, and the one who is Shi'a ibn Nun,

them, Moses, so God relieved them of them, but he is forbidden to them The sacred land is forty years, and they do not enter one of the attendees.This verse is applied to this story, as long as it is the same, especially if the verse of Surah is included, O people [Al -Ma’idah: 21] To the saying of the evolving people [Al -Ma’idah: 25] So he said, “Enter this village of the phenomenon that he

that afflicted those who did wrong is the epidemic that afflicted the twenty and the sins and the perseverance of that is also with the saying You are wounded on your lines, and you will turn off the losers [Al -Ma’idah: 21].Enter the door on them [Al -Ma’idah: 23], for the door is appropriate for the village.And his saying said that it is forbidden for them [Al -Ma’idah: 26] This is the correct

who agrees with what is in Surah Al -Aqd Enter the sanctified land that God has written for you [Table: 21] verses.And on this direction, he said (enter) either an entry into the entry of a village of closeness from them and it is ink to be a first place for them, and the matter is the matter of what is in It means that the fighting means that the verse of the extension was indicated, as he said:

country is the miserable country from a carpentry, and it is derived from the village with openness, so that it is a gathering, and it is the gathering that is said to the villages of the thing, and it will be.The small country and the large city of walls and doors, as I want it here with the evidence of his saying (and enter the door prostrating) and gather the village of the village of the

is that the intended of the prostration is the most absolute The weakness is not for them the people of the village, and this is one of the conditions of the head, and the mourning did not expose it.And the prostration of the prostration of the prostration of thanksgiving is because they are inside the spoilers, not so they opened, and it came in the authentic hadith that they were made.They

same, and this is the one who is the one who is the one.It was known in that place for the significance of the miracle, or it is one of the sayings of the question and the beggar, as it is not calculated for them the people of the village as an account and do not take a warning from them Take a saying that they address the people of the village.It was said that the question of the disbelief

Either for the sake of the weight of the ya with the weight of the form of the collection, or because it was not like me, he deserved to be relieved, but they did not treat it (my) is that it is (my name).The prodigy of my sin is an authenticity, so they relieved it to the heart of the ya, as they did in a finger and found it in the correct names as a counterpart, and it is pure.Sin is an act in the sense of an effective because it is a mistake in it, that is, your question (P-516), the authority of the sin, they indicated that it is a verb that does not come.He made a sin and disobedience.And his saying, and we will increase the good, and a promise of leadership from the best of the world and the hereafter, and for that, the act of an increase is deleted.Waw, the ritual of the sentence of we will increase [Al -A'raf: 161] on the sentence of our sayings, enter any and say we will increase the good.Because the sentence of we will tell the narration in the wall of Al -Araf, it is a matter of people, so he knew that she is expressing a counterpart to her in the words that God has addressed to him, Moses, Moses, on the authority It was reported here, the words of the saying were spoken to the saying.He said it, and it changed those who wronged a saying other than those who were said to them, that is, the same as the one who said the saying, who was commanded by Moses in the people in the people, which is the one who is in the people And the enemy is on them, and they said to them, "Do not be able to fight them and make them unknown, and for that, they

and what people spoke to them about the state of the village, and for the reference to all of this, he did the verb that was said to the extent.So (a saying) is a first effective for a substitute, and (other than the one who was said) is a second effective, because (a substitute) exceeds the two things from the door of what is the same.Like (his ribs, his garment).Abo Al -Shimis said: I turned from the cold of the youth with a creation and misery of the garment of the opponent and the extension The saying is without being said, so they changed it to pay the delusion that they had changed a

of righteousness with a poetry.And he said it, and it changed those who wronged and said it, and we descended on those who did wrong, who took care of them with the appearance of the position of the gay The one who is the tenth of those who spread the authority of the earth because they were the cause in the misery of a complete nation.And in this is a preaching and a male for everyone who sets itself to the guidance of people to be in vision, with what comes and the knowledge and knowledge of the slopes of the rituals In the example, “on its people, she relesants with a partish,” which is
