with the addition of the mim and open the lean after it, and then it is broken and packed - and it is frustrated.And the origin of stretching: it is stretched, that is, it is stretched because the booby -trapped, extends its steps, which is the walker of the admiration for itself.Here, the lying man has ended.The meaning: that he has been accustomed to the argument for the hereafter, and he did not care about the call of the Messenger ﷺ and went to his family, with his souls, and it is not in his mind.Ibn Attiyah said: He said: “All of them is all from his saying (neither charity nor praying) (P-363) I descended in Abu Jahil, he said: This verse is expressed in it in the words of the Almighty (stretching), as it was the gait of the sons of Khazum, and the father of ignorance was more than it.And in it a look will come close.So he said (Oli for you) and Eid, and it is a word that is used to conduct the course of the example in the obligation of this memorization, but it is attached to the signs of discourse, and the absence of the word With their saying: Woe to you, from a supplication on the boundary after it, after that, that is a supplication that the deceased be the lowest of it.(Fahli): The name is a preference from my guardian, and his actor is a deleted, deleted, domesticated, knowledgeable, known in the wedding Its meaning: your closeness is what you are You have said: There is a saying from him (so he said to them [Muhammad: 20]) from his saying (so they have obedience and a known saying [Muhammad: 20]) in Surah Al -Quta, Ali (Obedience and a known saying [Muhammad: 21]) It is not effective to the name of the impact.And Abu Ali Al -Farisi went until (the first) is a knowledge of the meaning of the king and that his weight is done from the money, which is the destruction, so the origin of his will be lost to you, that is, it is more destroyed for you -
