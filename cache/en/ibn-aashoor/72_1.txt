The researcher, I say, is revealed to me that he has heard a blow from heat, so they said that we have heard a wonder Quran that guides to the adult, so we believed in it and we will not share with us with one of us.By saying, it indicates that what will be mentioned after it is a strange and special event for the proportions of the participants who are the one who is the same as it is like that God will not send anyone [Al -Jinn: 7] as he comes.God commanded His Messenger ﷺ that the Muslims know that God has revealed to Him and a great event in his call, and God bless him, If one of the names that are marked by the Qur’an and their inspiration, or taught them, he understood what they heard, and he called them to the destiny of his guidance and the right to the truth And believing in the mission and the part, so the call of Islam was in its origins with a language to a world of absences, and there is no relationship with its supplies with the calamities, nor in the world, but it is a world His family is on the good or evil that they are not considered in the period To them with a partner.And God revealed to this part of them the entrepreneurship from the endowment of Islam and his guidance, so they understood it.This world is the world of gin, and it is according to what is saved from the narrators of the Qur’an and the chapter of the news of the Prophet, and its good is a type of the deceased, the meaning of the gossip.The thick, the hidden from the sense of sight and hearing, spread in an unknown possibility that is not on the surface of the earth, nor in the heavens, but it is in the atmosphere of the atmosphere, and it is in the atmosphere of others.The jewel is one of the cruel wives, that is: there are no bodies or gender, but rather the spirituality of spirituality, which is created from a firearm, and there is no life, and there is no life, and there is no life, and there is no life, and there is no life, and there is no way He paid it.This is the fierce chants of the gender of the bouquets under the jinn and the devils.Editable, and it is absent from the eyes, attached to the world of the unseen, the vision does not see it and does not realize the hearing of the people unless God blesses the feeling of its movements and the will to the face of the face of the face of the face of the face He made a habit of returning to the command of God and wanted him.And by adding and supporting this significance, even if each of them is not no longer that it thinks of the connotation, which is the oppression of the Qur’an, or the belief of the mantle and the connotation, which is the authenticity, which is the authenticity It is necessary to be criticized by the existence of hidden stations that are called hein, so that the suffering of the Qur’an is interpreted, so that the suffering of the Qur’an and the age of the Sunnah.(P-219) This is what is entered into the origins of Islam, and for that, we did not atone for my denial, and the extent of the appointments of this kind of this type, when it was not.Its truth in a segmental evidence, by disagreeing the condition of those who say: The remembrance of heaven was not mentioned in the Qur’an after his knowledge of the verses of his remembrance.As for what is narrated in the books from partial news in their appearances for people and their coming with wondrous countries, then this is from fictional narratives.We did not receive one of the proof of the scholars whom we have met whoever says: He saw their forms or their effects and what we find that stories except on the Sunnah of those who are the ones who are the ones With the news, or the imagination overlooks them.And if they are in them who are not accused of lies, but what is harmed by him is the same as the saying The garden that spoiled his prayers is one of his miracles, such as his angels and his vision of paradise and fire in the one who is the one who is the one who is the ritual My father is in the hadith of Zakat Fateh.The remembrance of heaven has passed with his saying and made to God the parts of hein [cattle: 100] in the wall of Anam, and he said it, and we have given us a lot of jerseys in the jur Surah Al -Arif.And those who commanded the Messenger ﷺ that they say to them that he was revealed to him with the news of heaven: they are all the people who were the prophet ﷺ informed by the Qur’an from the one who is the one who is the one who is the Qur’an They informed them of this news, because of his significance of this religion, the honor of his book, and the honor of those who came to him, and in which he enters the enlightening of the Muslims, and the two of the Muslims were the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who came to the Muslims, and he was They left the honor of the Qur’an and understood its intentions, and they do not know its absence and do not realize its rhetoric, so accept it, and those who came to them and those who came to them and those who came to them His rhetoric, they denied it and exposed it.And in the news about the recitation of the Jin for the Qur’an that he has revealed to him that there is no gesture that he did not know that this is what God has told him, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ritual of this.He did not know the presence of hein to recover the Qur’an before this verse is descended.As for the verse of the endowment, and when we have a slander of the jinn, they listen to the Qur’an [Al-Ahqaf: 29] (P-220) the verses, so it is reminded of what is in this verse or it is a sign of the story God ibn Masoud and is in the authenticity of a Muslim in the hadiths of the readers in the prayers and there is no relationship with it with this verse.And he said that he had heard a blow from hein in the position of an active deputy (inspired), meaning: I was revealed to me as a rhetoric.And the affirmation of the inspired news (that) is to be fulfilled by his Moroccan.And Zamir (that he) is the guarantor of the affairs and his informing a sentence of a bit of hein, and in that an increase in the news that is inspired by it.And the act of hearing a deleted person, we have heard a Qur’an, that is: the Qur’an was heard as a ritual of gin.Al -Nafr: The group is from one to ten and its origin in the language of a group of humanity He was released on a group of gin on the face of the likeness, as there is no other memory in the language, as a man was released in his saying, who are in the man of the jinn.[6] Jin.And they said that we have heard a wonderful Qur’an that they said to some of them, and he did not attend the Qur’an, whom they have inspired them to warn them and guided them to the righteousness of the righteous.And when we diverted to you a bounty of jinn, they listened to the Qur’an, and when they attended it, they said: “So, when he spent my guardian, they were grateful to their people.” 29] Verses.The meaning of the saying here: to inform their want to those who want to inform them of them from their type of in the way that they understand, for it is not for you The elderly, while it appears, the saying here is a bothering of the expressions of the soul in the same way, the same as the saying of the exalted That is to be honored by this religion, that God made him preachers from the two.It is permissible to be a psychological saying, that is, the phases of their jokes, the words of the saying that he sends from the will of the owner of the perception of his knowledge, For example, that is expressed by the saying, as in the house of the jungle, he talks about the dog of a good: The soul said to him that I do not see a sake ∗∗∗ (P-221) And it is the saying of the Exalted and they say in themselves if God does not torture us with what we say [Al-Mujadila: 8].And the assertion of the news (that); Because they told him a group of them, who doubt his fall, and they came in their words with what is beneficial to realize what they said, and he who expresses his example in the same).And describing the Qur’an with the marvel and description of the source of the exaggeration in the power of the meaning, that is: it is impressed with it, and the meaning of that is that it is a long time in its use.The science has obtained them with the advantages of the Qur’an by exposing them, and God gave them to them.Al -Mazari said in the explanation of Saheeh Muslim: Whoever believes in the Qur’an must know that the truth of miracles and the ugly conditions.After that, the science falls with the honesty of the Messenger; Either jinn has learned that or taught from the books of the advanced messengers, what indicated them that he is the prophet, the righteous, who is good.Ah.And I say that the jinn has a new knowledge of that with the illness of God for evidence that they did not feel it when they were not demanding that they have been known Impressive, God created in them on the face of the habit as a dignity of the Messenger ﷺ and for the Qur’an.And faith in the Qur’an requires faith in whom it comes to and whoever descends, and for that, they said, and we will not publish you with our Lord.He has obtained the souls of the jinn, the honor of knowing God, his attributes, and the sincerity of his Messenger ﷺ, and the honesty of the Qur’an and what he has heard from him They have become a good time, and they honored the widening in the last life, so they were not among the people of God to hell from heaven and human.And he was attached (heard) a deleted deletion that he said after him, and they said that we heard a wonderful Qur’an.Rashid: With the sake of the pioneering and the coffin of the sheen, or it is said that the opening of the opinion and the opening of the sheen is the good, the right and the guidance.Ten readings agreed on his readers with a hideout.And say them, and we will not publish you with our Lord, that is, that is fulfilled in the future.This requires that they were partners, and for that, they confirmed the denial of the ritual with the perception of the perspective, so their news confirmed the Qur’an and the blessing of it (that) On the authority of (La).
