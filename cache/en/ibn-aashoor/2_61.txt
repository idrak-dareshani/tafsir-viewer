bit, and that he is in the Qur’an of Abi Bin Kaab, with a thousand thousand, and that he has established a thousand thousand in some of the honors of Uthaman.Ibn Attiyah said it, and it was mentioned

sinful for the two loyalty, and that the two people are not fulfilled, then the words are not.Like a group Between the rituals and the compensation for it, then if we find the fulfillment with us that

humiliation of them, etc.From the rest of the answer to them, is what you have learned from his inclusion of the severity of them, the Father, the village entered the village, and for others to come from them The guarantee of the unseen is on its origin, but its merits for the addressees, but it is the way to the exposure, and it is the necessity of inheriting the inheritance of the children of

on the ground.He walked long, and crushed a dome and a house in a position like this in the sense of tightening and documenting it from the ground.Abda ibn al -Tabib said: “He who was a migratory house and said the Ziad al -Ajam”: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ What is all of this suffering is presented when he said that God is not ashamed to strike for example a compensation, so what is on the authority of it [Al -Baqarah: 26] and he said: The humiliation and the residence is a liking place, as the analogy and the dwelling in the surrounding of them and the obligation to the house or the dome are struck by the coffin.And the remembrance of the warning is a seduction because he has no youth in the analogy.It is permissible that it is a crushing, and there is no place in that there is a place that is likened to the obligation of the humiliation of them and its sake of the one who is the same, The perspective to the suspicion is the event and the description, not the self in the sense that the righteousness of the urbanization in the verb is not the title of it as a follower of the verb of what is in the same way It is a modernity, and it is the meaning of their saying, and it was done in the verb, as follows for its running (P-528) in the source.It is a way and it is a way in the verse, its good king in the explanation of the scouts and its immorality Displacement and made the warning a sense in the sense of surrounding and comprehensiveness, whether it was like the dome or the clay, and they are the arguments of this in this way.Then, his saying is the Almighty and the humiliation is attached to them, it is not as a matter of saying the increase in the glory: ؎ The tolerance, the calm, and the dew ∗∗∗ in the dome of the one who is the same The dome in the verse is likened to it and is not in the presence of the dome in the house.It can be a truth.Al -Tayebi made the evangelist the verse on the two impersonations in the slogan as a seduction of the universe of Jews.And the young humiliation, and it is the fraction of the humiliation, and it is not other than it, and it is against the pride.Zel.The poor of the poverty is derived from the tranquility, because the poverty reduces the movement of its owner.It is called the weak and the poor for the poor.And the meaning of the obligation of humiliation and dwelling to Jews that they lost the misery and the courage, and it seemed to them with the poverty and the need with the abundance They have a nomad, and for that, the keenness has become a resting place in their aftermath.And the domestication of the domestication, and it is here to move the case, which pleases God to his anger.* * * (P-529) That is that they were atone for the verses of God and killed the prophets, without the truth, that is what they disobey The obligation of humiliation and the domestication of them and the indication of what was presented from his saying and the humiliation of the humiliation and the domestication of them is angry.And the name of the signal is reluctant to interpret the referred to the masculine, and it is the first to pay the individuals from the individuals of the guerrilla in the saying of a depression: The vitiligo said Abu Ubaida to Raibah: If you want the lines, say as if, and if you wanted the black and the white, then say as if.Raouna said: I wanted as if that is and that is, but it was not in the verse, the first of the individuals because the humiliation and the dwelling and the anger are what is not seen, so it is not indicated to itself, and it is not referred to, and it is not indicated to itself, but it is not indicated to itself, but it is not indicated to itself, but it is not indicated to the same One of the masculine and saying, and from this, is the saying of that, that we call on you from the verses and the wise male [Al -Imran: 58], that is, that is the precedent.And from him the saying of the exalted one of that [Al -Baqarah: 68] and the owner of the scout and the one who did not have the goodness of that is that the names of the sign are not.Likewise, the connections, and for that came, which in the sense of gathering came.It was said that he was collecting the names of the sign and its reinforcement was not by increasing signs, but rather it was in the conservation Especially in these conditions, so it was the use of some of it in a sense that is easier if it was in interpretation.It is a little serious because the orbit is on the verge and the metaphor was in the use of a lot in the sense of another or in the use of a formula in the last sense, so it is not good for this He appears.Perhaps he wanted that (who) is a place for a sink that refers to it.And who is a person who is known as a righteousness, is good for the release of one, the gathering, the gathering, the remembrance, and the feminine, and what is happening from the names of the reference and the reference to the reference We have the same and the whole is the one for those, but it is a name in the sense of the praise and the group, not that it is a singularity, and a group of people, so it is not a matter of it, so it is not mentioned, and it is not the same.This is the good of the expansion of the individual from it for the significance of the multiplicity.And what is in his saying that they were atonement for a captivity, that is, their disbelief and what was with it was a reason for their punishment in the world with humiliation and the righteousness and the ritual of the last It is a matter in the same way as what they have fallen into.(P-530) And say it and kill the prophets, without the truth, especially for the evolution of the Jews who have churned this generous generosity, whether it is in the same way He silenced him and did not support the prophets.Judy was killed by the prophets of the people of the son of Mawas, who was alive in the eighth century before the eighth.The Christ was published by a tree.And the throne of the Prophet, who was alive in the middle of the horn, before the Christ, and that is because it is the most of the tubes and the advice to the Jews, and it is a murder.That is a disagreement.And the brother of the brother, Abu Yahya, who killed him, Herod Al -Abrai, the king of Jews by the Roman, because Zakaria tries to leave his son, who lives in the murder The prophecy of Jesus, and Yahya ibn Zukayyah, was killed by Herodes, to the anger of the daughter of Akhtah, Herod, on Yahya.And he said that it is not the right, that is, the one who is considered an adept in their project, because it is in it: that it is the one who killed a soul with a soul or a corruption in the land of the land.32] This restriction is from the pilgrims to the origins of their religion to create their resources Because the messengers are not overwhelmed by their enemies because it is a ruling on the ruling of the message that is the tuber.And then the claim of Christians was that Jesus was killed by Jews as a claim that is contrary to the ruling of the sending, but God ended the period of his messenger with the intention of the intention.And that was said by what they disobeyed and they were used The same as the one who is referred to with that first of that, so it will be a confusion of the sign of the increase in the visibility of the referred to him with his knowledge of his knowledge, and the disobedience will be the disobedience To strike the humiliation and the dwelling, and the anger of God is upon them, and the verse is then from the trusteeship, and it is a sinner of kindness, like the saying Those are the ones who are the heedless [Al -A'raf: 179].It is permissible for those referring to that of that second is the disbelief in the verses of God, and the prophets were killed by them, so that this is a sign of the reason for the sake of humiliation, so what is the same The cause is alerting it that Edman al -Asa is leading to the elimination of it and the transmission from its smallest to its greatest.And the costume on the two captives is a captive at the origin of its cursing.And there is no need to make one of the two in the sense of (P-531) with the ability to make the name of the second reference to the first of the first to take from the words of the revelation of the one who is in the way Its reports and arts, it is its success.The one who called for the custody of this face was the one who spent the words from an unemployed, who would overwhelm what they disobeyed on that they were atonement for if the indication of the deceased was the one.We have noticed you to pay off this that the confusion sings the singing of kindness.
