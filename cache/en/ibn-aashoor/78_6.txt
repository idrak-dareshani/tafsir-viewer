The Quranic researcher, we make the earth as a risk when the greatest news came to them by the Qur’an, the heroic of their idols, and the repetition of the creation of their bodies, and they are the ones who are the ones From God and his reflection on (P-13), the Messenger of God ﷺ and their irrigation of their denying, this is the nose of the existence of the two words of his saying: “On the authority of the Prophet” Various [Prophet: 3].He will come after his collection with his saying: The day of the chapter was a meeqaat [the Prophet: 17].And God gathered to them in these verses to the polls on the guidance of the rituals of creation, and on the rest of the bodies to return to the mission after the time of the one who did not find it.Great creatures.And to be the sentence in the sign of the indicative, it was not overlooked by what was before it.And the words are directed to the denial of the resurrection, and they are directed to them.Because the words are brought up in the power of the guarantor of the speech with the evidence of kindness, and we have made you married [the Prophet: 8] to it.And the understanding is not to make a report, and it is a report on the negation, as it is the majority of the formulas of the conflict, to be after it, and the denial of it, (No), and that exile is like excuses for the determined if he wants to be denied, but the intended is the report of the fall of the land, not with the exile, not with the exile, not the exile For a stagnant, you will confirm the meaning of the report.The meaning: He made the earth as a majestic, and that will be overlooked by him and our morals will be married.33] In Surah Al -Baqara.And only acknowledges them.On the ease of the second creation of the creatures is without the first creatures, the Almighty said: The creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the people [Ghafir: 57] - that is, the second - and not more They know [Ghafir: 57].And make the earth: created it in that state; Because it is a threat to it that has the creation of its creation, and from the most important of that, it is before it before the creation of the human being, but God does not know it.The meaning: He created it in the event that it is like a risk; The words are similar to it.(P-14) and the expressing with (Najl) without: Ethics; Because its being is a state of state when it is created or after it with the disagreement of the verb of creation, then it exceeds the self or to the description Created death and life [King: 2].And the guidance: the bridge of the mim, the driving bed, the slow, the weight of the act in which it indicates that its origin is a source called it for the sake of the language.And in the dictionary: The majestic is intended in the Mahdah who is made for the sabudi.And on all, it is similar to the land with it; As he made her surface A facilitator for the sitting on it, the blurring, and the wicked, and that is an indication of the creativity of creation and facilitation on the people, so it is a curse that includes the one who is in the way of the one, A notification of the wisdom of God Almighty; As he made the earthly miserable for the creatures on which he is on, then he who made these makers is not miraculous to create the bodies again after.And the abuse is from the most gracious here, reminding them of the preference of God, that they may raise themselves from the perseverance and accept the view when they pray for them to the Messenger.And the appropriateness of the appearance of the reciprocate is that the mission is the creation of the earth that the resurrection is the exit of the people of al -Hashara from the ground, so the earth was the best of the thing to the one who is the same Baath, meaning: the people of the graves.And the earth made a thigh that includes the cursing of the origin of the earth on the way of briefing, and for that, it was not exposed to it after the exposure.
