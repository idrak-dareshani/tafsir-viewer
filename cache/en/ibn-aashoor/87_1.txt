The Quranic researcher praised the name of your Lord, who created, and who was destined to be lost, and who was brought up, and he made him a leanness.The opening with the matter of the Prophet ﷺ by praising the name of his Lord with the saying, he will give permission that he will throw to him his punishment with a vicious and good for him, and he said: 6] The verses are as it will come in the sponsorship of the cores.(P-273) The speech is for the Prophet ﷺ.And the praise: the eagerness of the disclosure, and it is one of the names that are not added to the other name of God Almighty, as well as the derivative actions from it, do not raise and do not.For God, as well as the names of the source from Him: Glory be to God.It is one of the religious suffering, so it is more likely that it is transmitted to the Arabic from the Abbariyah and it was presented when it is the Almighty saying: And we are praised by the cow.And when he did the work of the matter with praise here to a name, he was appointed that the one who is commanded by it is a saying that indicates that God will be done by the way of the ritual With the sacred descriptions to prove it to what indicates itself from the highest names and suffering, and when it was sayings, they were attached to the name of God, with the consequences The honorable news and the descriptions of the names indicated by God, from the flags and characteristics and its parts, and that is an eel to its etiquette with the name of that name.And for this there is a lot in the Qur’an, the arrogance of the praise of the name of God.On the first of this interpretation.So the praise of the name of God is the name of his honesty in Al -Khawisah, and among the people with a remembrance that follows his pretext from the heads and the hopes such as prostration and praise.This includes the survivors of the dirt with the praise of that, the suffering of these gossip, as it is intended to speak.And with the appearance of the penetration with the consequences of the meaning, the meaning of the meaning is deepened to the speaking of the speaker, and the exalted of the exalted of God.As for the slave thinking about the greatness of God, the Almighty and the reciprocity of his eagerness in his mind, it is a praise for the self of God and the name of his name, and the name of God is not called.Because that does not take place on the authority of God Almighty, then this is the praise of the same God and not to praise His name.And this is the angel of separation between the memorization of the praise with the memorial of the name of God, we are the praise of the name of your Lord, and between his attachment to the name of the name of the name of the name of the name And praise him [man: 26], and they praised him and praised him, and for Him they prostrate [Al -A'raf: 206].That was a praise for his name (P-274), and if we deny the deity from idols because they are not It is created as in the words of the Almighty: Those who call from God will not create flies and if they gathered to Him [Hajj: 73] that was not for God, not to praise God, not for the sake of God.Because his name was not done in this speech, news, no confidentiality.This is the scope of the difference between the seizure of the name of your Lord, the severity of it, the praise of it, and the fundamentals of the two divisions in the meaning and one; Because both divorce are intended for guidance to the knowledge of that God is out of purity.And he knows that what indicates the will of praise with the saying that there is a verse in the words that requires it, such as the time of the time in the words of the words of it.[Al -Ahzab: 42] The one who costs his trust is the sayings and verbs without the constituents, and the same is the transgression [Al -Sajdah: 15] Praise be to God, so it is not accompanied by a saying like it.And the name of the name of the addition of the addition to your Lord without knowing it with the addition to the knowledge of the Majestic, Nahu: Praise the name of God, for what he feels with him and the description of the Lord.As for the addition of a Lord to the guerrilla of the Messenger ﷺ, let him share it with this addition, and that he will have an increased luck for the seizure of praise.Then he was running on the memorization of your Lord, the highest attribute of the upright, and the sake of his estate, so it is achieved for the bonds of the bonds of the same descriptions of the same descriptions On people with their creation in the best of the evaluation, their guidance, their livelihood, and their livelihood, for their gesture to the matter of the matter of the matter of his name It is worthy of itself and its description in the description that it is the creator of the creatures as a creation that indicates the knowledge and wisdom and the mastery of the industrialists, and that it is the same and the one who is the same The human beings in the breath and the body, and the first three attributes of the first characteristics of the occasion for the widow of the surah as we will show it.The highest is a name that benefits the increase in the row of the high, meaning: the reactions.And the reactions are numbers in the knowledge of people from the fullness, so the high is not attributed to the same time He has the absolute precedence, as in his description of the exalted here, and for this he was told by Pharaoh that he said: I am your Lord, the highest [Al -Naazat: 24].(P-275) The highly derived from it and the highest upper lifetime is a metaphor, and it is the perpetuating perfection.And his description is not the highest of the highest in the meter of good names, asking for his high name, because the names of God are a metaphor, so it is not one of the attributes of God, the attribute of God, the attribute of God The launch of the launch of the names, and it is a lord of the attributes, Al -Ghazali said: The high level of the mental arrangement is the same as the high levels, and the proverb, and the example Like the way between the causes The reason, the cause, the high, the acting, the subject, the complete, and the deficiency.And the altruism of this description in this surah because it includes the inclusion of the Qur’an and the installation of its delivery and what it includes from the remembrance of it The comments and description of the divine high, as it is his words.This description is the angel of law in the interpretation of the attributes of God, and its pregnant women are up to the highest, so that it is necessary to be interpreted from the rituals.He has been made from his saying: He praised the name of your Lord, the supplication of prostration in prayer, when he replied that the prostration said: Glory be to the highest Lord, so that the effect of the ritual The saying is the saying.And the sentence of creation, so it was broken on two and two descriptions of creation, and described the level of creation, and deleted the verb of creation, so it is permissible for it to be in general The interpreters, and it was narrated from a gift, and it is the case of the act of the verb if it does not indicate a sign of it, that is: the creation of every creature, so it will be like a saying.Moses, our Lord, who gave everything that he created, then guided [Taha: 50].It is permissible to be appreciated in particular, that is, the human being created as the gospel estimated, or the creation of Adam as it was narrated from the laughter, that is: with the villages of the Qur’an, it is not the same.Hope: If I settle it and breathe in it from my soul [Al -Hajar: 29] the verse.And he sympathized with a sentence of fulfillment of the fulfillment without the waw to the sign until its content is the intended from the prayer and that what is before it is a slowdown in it as it is in the saying of the saying There is an abundance of the generous person who prays, so the dawn is the repentant, because the tendency is right if they become, so he sings their money and did not do it and did not see it.Fulfillment is from his saying: So he settled for the one in remembrance by administering that creation is provided by the advertisement of the one who is considered to be the one who is the same.And the settlement: the level of what it created is, for if it is carried over the general, then the level is to make every gender and variety of the boundaries, that is: it is appropriate for the sake So, the age of the closer of its creation, to the same as its creation, to defend itself with it with ease.And to be a comparison to the creation, it is compared to the act of creation with the beneficial fulfillment of the reason, that is, it arranged for the creation of its level.And estimation: putting the estimated and creating it in the things in its self and its strength, it is said: it is destined to destroy and destroy the lightness with a meaning.The jams read the tightness and read it alone by lowering.And al -Muqdar: its origin is the same as the thing that is connected to the dumping, the cake, the adulterer, or the enemy, and it is called here to form the creatures on the way A phase of the phenomenon of the phenomenal parts, such as the hands, and the interior is like the heart, and from the deposit of mental powers like a sense And the obedience and the manufacturer.And the return of the name of the communication in his saying: He who has estimated and said: He who has brought out the pasture with the abuse of the letters of kindness from his confusion, for the sake And its crushers for the consequences of the communication, and this is the requirements of the softens.And his saying: So, the same as the compassion of my level, then if you create a creation and appreciate the general act of the verb, the guidance was general.And the saying in the face of kindness, so that the fulfillment of the words is like the saying in the kindness of my level.And the compassion of the grace of the causes of the caused by the causes of the causes, that is, so that all (P-277) is appreciated by what was destined for it, so the guidance of the human being and the types of the gender of the one who has the same It is the guidance of the inspiration to the way to seek the restrictions in which it is estimated from the merits and powers, as it suits its resignation in it, so the more he obtains something of the effects of that The dedication to its dedication.The meaning: all the things were appreciated and guided them to the performance of their jobs as it was destined for them, for God, when he appreciated a person to be a metaphor for the authority, the knowledge, and the industry of the goodness, and the manufacture He guided him to seek his thought to what he created for him, and when the cow was destroyed for the dirham, her grassy and lamented and his son are to be able to turn to you The bee to produce honey is it to be inspired by the light and the nomads, and its inspiration is to build the mountain and its hidden cells in which the honey is placed.And for the sake of the appearance of the ability and the guidance, the estimation of the forces of the reproduction of the accent of the return of the type.So the act of a deleted guidance to benefit the general, and it is a general public, which is in it in which the guidance is the guidance of the guidance.God has destroyed its system, and it is not estimated that the perception is the same as the estimation of the richness of the tree, and the resurrection is to renew the germination, so this is not possible for it to say: Created and estimated, but it is not a guide for the bond of its goodness to the guidance, and if it was made a special creation, which is the human being, it was an act of the one who is able to do.The estimation of the human powers, and the guidance was a special guidance, which is the significance of awareness and mind.The description of the level and the guidance was made among the attributes of the actions that are blessings on people and a sign of the fulfillment of God to the transcendence of the Tanzah; Because these two descriptions are suitable for what was completed by the surah, then the one who settled the creation of the Prophet ﷺ is a prayer that is perfect for what he created for the sake The message does not miss it to prepare it for the memorization of what he suggests to him and facilitate him and give him a valid project for that time, he said: And we will make you happy [Al -Ala: 8].And his saying: The one who has been removed from the creation of the gender of the plant from the trees and others.He was taken over some of its types Palm; Because it is the pension of the domain that people benefit from.(P-278) and what is meant: his delay is from the earth, which is his genius.And the grasser: The prophet that was sponsored by Al -Sawam, and its origin: either a mechanical export that is released on the heavy thing from the release of the source of the verb like the same The creature, or the name of the pastor, is called what I am in which it is alerted and seized a metaphorical release due to the relationship of solutions, as the name of the valley was released on the water.And the presidency made it an effective to get out, and the ritual word of the pasture without the memorization of the plant, because the pastor of the pastor feels from the benefit of the one who is the one who is the benefit of it and the benefit of it.They take it with the sponsorship of the faction.The sickness: by adding the richness and relieving the third, and it is said that the triangle is tightened, which is Japan from the plant.And Al -Ahwi: Sufism with the wiping of the HI and the tightening of the waw, and it is from the colors: a broom that is closer to the black.It is a nausea adjective because the sickness is dry, so its greenness is valid.And this description is the same as it is necessary to change it, after it was green, and that is an indication of its exaltation with the exaltation and the end.And in the description of the grazing of God and made Him a sickness, it contained with what he preceded by the descriptions in the context of the appropriateness between it and between the exhibitors that have the words, the words of the words of the words of the words He was deducted from him from the project that the people benefit from the state of the absurdity that the spray is alerted, so the animals and the dawn are intended, and that this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same In it, as the pasture complements and informs his ripening when he becomes a nurseries, on a luminous way, a place that is established to it with a remembrance, which is necessary.And this gesture came and detailed it with the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: “The example of what God has sent me from the guidance is like a lot of relief So you wore a lot and a lot of grass, and it was the water of the water, so God benefited people with it, and they drink and watered and planted the hadith.(P-279) It is permissible for the intended to be from a sentence, so he made it a sickness that contains the integration of the lesson in the way of what God called in the creatures from the different from the one who is from the one To remember the knowledge after life as he said: God who created you from weakness, then he made after a weak force, then he made it after the time The knowledgeable knowledge [Al -Rum: 54] for the indication that the period of life of life for things that resemble the short period, so it is receptive to the kindness of making it the sickness The ruling of those who are given to it will be obtained in it, and that is from the same saying of the Almighty: the example of the worldly life is as a mutation that we have descended from the sky, so the heaven is not.The people and the year eaten [Yunus: 24] to his saying: We made it a harvest as if it did not sing with the eminent [Yunus: 24].
