The researcher of the Qur’an, O Adam, their prophets with their names when he entered this saying in the sentence of the conjugate Other than those who addressed the sayings before him, he is a discourse of a discourse for them, because what is meant is from the speech The side was (P-417) the speech in a house to be a marketer for them because he said, after that, he said: Did I not say to you that I know the absence of the heavens His dedication - with the fact that it is not far from the hearing of the divine matter - for his intensity with the same as Adam and the appearance of his name in the highest fullness until he gets the good When the commander; Because the matter of the commander and the addressee - with the fraction - if it is kind to the addressee - with the conquest - to remember his name and not be confined to the guerrilla of the speeches, not to make it not.A discourse, and it is what came in the hadith of the intercession after the mention of the prostration of the Prophet and God bless him with the praise that he is inspired It is interceded by “and this is the name of the remembrance of the name even in the past as the speaker as the Qais” said: “The two words are not, some of this pampering, and may God bless you His name appeared because there is no way to bring him to the addressee except by the mediation of the call, for the appeal of every fate that is used in the meaning of the metaphor.* * * When they expressed their names, the news of their informing about the names, and there is a gesture that the experienced is something that is important.And the guarantee of the boundary, with the addition of the heavens of the heavens, is the same as a guarantee (their presentation), and in its conduct in the form of the guarantees of the minds of what was decided in its saying, then the one who is.] And he said it, when he wore them with their names, the guerrilla is in a woman, and in the name of the name of the name of the majesty, but it was not given a name for him, that is, it is a good name with it.The burden of Adam Adam in his saying is their foresight and their foreplay because the context is a consort on the fact that this saying is not issued by Adam.* * * He said: Did I not say to you that I know the absence of the heavens and the earth is an answer for what, and the one who says is God Almighty and he is the one who is mentioned in his saying, and when your Lord said [Al -Baqarah: 30] and he returned to him) And (know) and (their offer) and what he accepted from the conscience, and it is a reminder to them by saying to them in the first hostility that I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30] I know the absence of the heavens and the earth (P-418), but it includes it because the general (you do not know) is included in all of that, so it is the saying of it And the land is a ray for what was beautiful in the first saying that it is equal to him, because (what you do not know) is the absence of the heavens and the earth, and the two people have increased here on the one With his saying: * * * And I know what you seem to be and what you were assessed, but it came with a wilderness before the appearance of the proof, and it comes with detailing after the way of the way, and it is the way to the way of the way, and it is the same The lawsuit and the separation of the result, because the preacher before the bet may be made by the skeptical of the Samaid that he carries it on the exaggeration, and it is the same, and after the wickedness of the The pilgrims stand on his mistake and its grace, and that he is obligated to the authority of his betting By following what you have not been able to be patient [Al -Kahf: 78] As for the travel [the cave: 79] to its saying and what I did from my command [the cave: 82] and then he said that He has patience [Al -Kahf: 82], and he came in the name of the distant sign of the greatness of the following after its appearance.This is a way that is for the writers and the speeches, and it returns to the base of taking the arguments from the old ones in the creation of the creation, as I have shown it in the book of the origin of the book, And the most speeches are pushed into the abuse of his speech after the submission and the gifts, and the verse came on the way of the sermons and the abolition of what we mentioned to the good On the basis of the case, which is not observed by the guarantors of the affluent, the angels do not pass through that the saying of the right and the promise of the righteousness, so that they do not go to the righteousness.And (you were) in his saying and what you were doing the appearance that it is an increase in the affirmation of the fulfillment His faith and know the signs of the first.And the formula of the harms in your appearance and the consequences of the significance of that, so that it is necessary to find the knowledge of God with that as it is renewed from them.And for them here are the costs of making (you) to the significance of the past time and make (you look) to be upheld, and the ability of a conversion in the side of the side of the side You conceal, and a sufficiency in the absence of heavens and the earth means and their martyrs, and all of that has no reason for me.And God has made the knowledge of Adam with the name and the miracles of the angels from that mark on the people of the human species for his disagreements in the land without the angels, because it is the same The disagreement of God Almighty in the rise (P-419) with what he wanted from the age of all his hearts and his people in the sense that God Almighty has been blessed with the nomadic naughty The type in the land is based on the place of the destiny of God, the highest of the whole of the works in which the human beings do, and there is no doubt that this disagreement does not take care of the knowledge Of the knowledgeable and the achievement of the appropriateness between the things, its signs and comparisons, which is the knowledge that the good person is blessed with, the good and the evil, and the goodness of the good Evil is all in its position, and this science is not reconciled except the powerful power, which is the power of the thinking that is clear, its appearance, the knowledge of the names of the things, the name of the things, the name of the things, the name of the things, the name It is possible to export the fading of the verbs because that power is the one that does not confine its commentators and does not stop its information as it is as long as the one who is the same Now and to what God Almighty wants.And the angels when they did not create a prejudice to that until I miracle them and put the names for the heavens and they were caught on a single prostration, and it is not a prostitute, and it is not a prostitute, and it is not a prostitute, and it is not a prostitute.Do not be a backwardness, they are not qualified to benefit from the unknown from the information so that their knowledge does not stop.And they did not be the source of the mourning that enables its breasts to give the world, so they are good, and if it is righteous to the righteousness of their world, the purpose of the purified is not the purpose of the purpose The world of mixed, and the wisdom of its mixing is the appearance of the deity, as Abu al -Tayyib said: The dew is placed in the position of the sword with the same as a bad thing The position of the dew and the verse requires a great distress for this type in this section and in the best of knowledge, but it does not indicate the preference of the nomadic nomadic, not the good.It requires the preference as it is clear in the sharp difference and sidelines, so this is a virtue from one side, but the preference is eliminated.As the hadith of Moses and Al -Khadar indicated that he was.And the questioning is in his saying (I did not say to you), etc.Rather, the questioning signed on the negative of the saying that the majority of the arrival understands what is alleged to the exile to the purpose of the power to the one who does not He asks about the negation of the matter He decides him on his negation, so if he acknowledges his acknowledgment is necessary for him, there is no intention to him from him.This is the laws of the dignitarian, the most important to him, and he who was repeated in the Qur’an (P-420) and built upon him the owner of the scouts, the suffering of his verses from which he said: God is able to be able [Al -Baqarah: 106] and the son of Hesham stopped in the sinner of the Libyan and his response to him.The report may fall into the original, we have said to people [Al -Ma’idah: 116], and it is a report that is intended for the heroes of the lawsuit of the Christians and said: “Do you do this?” Ibrahim [Al -Anbiya: 62].
