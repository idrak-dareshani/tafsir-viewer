The Quranic researcher is that he was a hell of the hells, which was a source of mourners in which there are no elders that it is permissible for a sentence that Hell was a roded in a second time His saying: The day of the chapter was a meeqaat [the Prophet: 17] and the ability: The day of the chapter is that hell was in it for the tyrants, and the domesticated is the one who said: (Meteorological), meaning: the observance in it, that is: on that day; Because the meaning of the observations is close to the meaning of the meeqaat; Both of them are determined by the parts of the tyrants.And the entry of a letter (that) in the news of (that) is beneficial to affirmation of the affirmation that the letter of affirmation benefited from the saying: The caliph is that God is pleased with His Excellency, with Him, who will make the ends and those who say His Excellency: The people who believe and those who have guided, the Sabeans, the Christians, the Christians, and the people, and those who are the one who are the people The day of resurrection is separated from them [Hajj: 17] as it is presented in the wall of Hajj, and the sentence will be from the perfection of what they are attached to it by saying: “The day of the rituals”.And expressing (the tyrants) is a demonstration in the status of giving to the registration of them with the description of the tyrants; Because it is necessary to say (you are a pain).It is permissible to be a nursery with a two -year -old man from a sentence if the day of the chapter was a meeqaat [the Prophet: 17] and what he was afflicted with; Because that is what is enriched in the souls of those who are smiling, asking what will be after that horrors, so I will answer with the guarantee that Hell was the greeting of the verse.And to him; It is not in his saying: (for the tyrants) is a disagreement on the contradiction of the appearance.And the remembrance of Hell is prevalent because the place is a standard of guidance; As the surah is initiated by the remembrance of the two partners, the mission is, and we will remember it from the formation of this sentence.(P-35) Wagnim: a name for the house of torment in the hereafter.It was said: It is an Arab name, so perhaps it is Arabized from the Abbariyah or from an other high language, and it was presented at his saying: 206] In Surah Al -Baqara.And the meteorology: the place of the monitor, that is: the neck, which is the weighing of a verb who was overwhelmed in the name of the verb machine For the place that is spent from it.The meaning: Hell is a place that is kept from it, and they will be seen by those who go to it from the people of the tyrants, as the people of the people are seen.It is permissible to be edible.And the one who is about it is about hell for the sacrifice until it was the origin of the monitor, meaning: I do not spoil anyone who has the right to enter it.It is permissible to be a meteorite for the monotheistic monitor, such as a row of exemption and a perfume.It is attached to it (her).Because Hell was likened to the one of the monotheism - with your honest investigation - and it is the one from the goat who stands with the observation, as the wasting is only a man.It is attached to (obstetrics), deleted, which is evidenced by his saying: for the two migrants.And appreciation: a source of the tyrants, and this is the best; Because the readers of the Surah are a short, so the stand is good at (observatory) to be two centuries.And to make you (for the tyrants) attached to (greeting) and make a attachment (pain) estimated that it (for the tyrants) so that it will be like the two of the two.As it was the remainder of the first century in the loyal century, then the century would be long.And if you had to make (for the tyrants), it is contradictory to it between (observations) or (pain), so there is no reason for that.And I was ousted (she was) without being said: Hell is a source for the significance that he made it (P-36).Miqat [Al -Naba: 17] in which there is a gesture to the capacity of God's knowledge, as he promises in his eternity a punishment for the tyrants.And Maba: The place of the father, which is the return, is released on the headquarters and the caller, release his origin, and then he was a poem, and he became a name for the place of the place.And he (pain) was erected in the case of (hell) or on the authority of a second news to do (it was) or on the fact that it is a detection of (greeting) because the monotheism is from the authority of it.To be a liage to hell.And (for the tyrants) is attached to (a pain) presented to him to enter the ritual on the two polytheists who have been overwhelmed by God, and this is what you know.And you make it attached to (greeting) or a dispute in it between (greeting) or a dispute between it (greeting) and (pain) as well.And the tyrants: the equivalent of the limit in the numbers of the heritage is the right of others and the arrogance, and the definition is in it for the covenant, so what is intended for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is said to be said: [The Prophet: 18] It is a demonstration in the denomination of the addition of the intention of nods to the reason for making hell to them; Because the evil is the maximum of the tyrants; For those who shared God, they exposed to His worshipers and arrogant to His Messenger ﷺ where they were exhausted from the acceptance of his calls, and they are the one who is in the way His saying is explained by him: They were not hoping for an account [the Prophet: 27] and lied to our verses as a liar [Al -Naba: 28].This is that the Muslims who are hidden by the rights of God, or those who are accustomed to people without a right, and resent Receive them from the state of the people of infidels.The pollution: the resident is place.And it was affected (two years) as a case.And the public read it (for two years) in the form of a gathering.Humza read it, and it is clear from Yaqoub (Latheen) on the form of a collection (broad) from the proverb A disagreement in it, or from the likeness of the likeness, then it requires that the bond is as it is like the one who is blurring in a place that is not reluctant to it.And Iqab: the collection of rights - with two sins - and it is a long time as the eighty years, and it was presented in its saying: or he spent the rights of the cave: 60] (P-37) and its collection here is intended for the great length; Because the most extremes of truth and hatred are to be in where it is intended to go to the elders, and explain these other verses indicating the immorality of the two participants, so this is the way of this The common known in the words is as long as it is for the permanence without the end.There is no significance in it that this period has an end until it is needed for a call to copy this with the verses of the immortality, which is an illusion; Because the news is not transcribed, or it needs to make the verse to the disobedience of the believers; If that is not from the first place of the Qur’an, as the believers were days, who were good and glorified in their business.
