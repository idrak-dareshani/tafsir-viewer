The Quranic researcher, with the hardship, is easy, with the hardship.Fulfillment is a shout that is expressed by a capable words that are indicated by the consequences here, that is: if you know this and decide, you know that the secret is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the family of We are the opposite of the hardship, accompanied by the secret of the hardship, which is necessary to break the effect of the hardship and a void of his work, for it is a symbolic form of an adulterers from the same While it was preceded, and it is angry with the promise of that in all its conditions.And the path of speech is a promise to the prophet ﷺ that God will facilitate the difficulties for Him the more it is presented to him, so the secret is not behind the attachment to those of the sacraments, and that (With) the indication of accompanying.And the word (with) here is anesthetic in other than the right to its meanings; Because the hardship and the ease are the arms of their comparison with a championship, so it is that the awareness is upset for the closeness His bids, with the signs of the true meaning of the meaning.Thus, the opposition is pushed between this verse and between its words, the Almighty: (God will make after the difficulty of the ease [divorce: 7]) in the surah of divorce.This verse is in a special hardship that is presented to the Prophet ﷺ and the sigra of the divorce is general, and the distance has a varying meat.So the defamation in the “hardship” is the definition of the covenant, that is: the hardship that has its covenant and his knowledge, and it is before what the grammar of the kufa calls that (Al) has a muddy from the addition of it His exalted say: (Paradise is the shepherd [Al -Nida’at: 41]) That is: with your hardship is easy, so all of the surahs will be caused by a place with the righteousness of the righteous.(P-414) God promised the Almighty to be his prophet ﷺ that God made the difficult things to be pleased with him, which is what preceded him and his promise to him with his saying: And he added (that) to be fulfilled by news.Rather, he did not seek to fulfill the fulfillment, as Sheikh Abd al -Qahir says: (If) she enriches the singing of the fulfillment of causes; Because the fulfillment here I want the eloquence with it with the reason, and if it is confined to a letter (that) the fascination of the meaning of the eloquence.And deny (a secret) to exalt, that is, with the hardship, you are a great function that overwhelms the hardship, and it is permissible for this to be a promise to the prophet ﷺ and his nation; Because what is presented to him is the hardship of it, but it is exposed to it in the affairs of his call to religion and for the right of the Muslims.Ibn Jarir narrated on the authority of Yunus and Ma’amar on the authority of Al -Hasan from the Prophet that when this verse has come down (for the hardship is easy), the Messenger of God said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ” A hardship will be overwhelmed by a secret.And in Al -Muwalat, “Abu Ubaidah ibn al -Jarh was written to Omar ibn al -Khattab, he recalls a crowd of the Romans and what he feared from them, so he wrote to him: Omar: As for after: it is what is descended with a believer servant from a hose of intensity that makes God after him a vocabulary, and he will not be difficult for a day.His supporter of Aisa ibn Sherih said: I heard Anas ibn Malik saying: “The Prophet was sitting and in his mind a stone, and he said: If the hardship came, then this is the hardship of this.The secret until he enters it and brings it out, and God has descended and exalted (for the hardship is easy, with the hardship, it is easy.Sherifa, Ibn Kathir said: Abu Hatim Al -Razi said: In the hadith of Aisa ibn Sherrah, weakened.Ibn Jarir narrated the same from Ibn Mas'oud Muqwaqa.It is permissible for a sentence to be (for the hardship is easy), and it is exposed between a sentence (and we raised you with your remembrance [Explanation: 4]) God is a kind of his servants, so he appreciated that they would not be difficult for a mixture of confusion, and that if not for that the people of the people, he said: (And if he takes it to the people of God Daba [bees: 61]).(P-415) It was narrated from Ibn Abbas.The hardship: the hardship in the desired and the intended work.And the ease against it, which is: the ease of the description of the foam and the number of fatigue in it.The sentence (with the hardship is easy) is confirmed by a sentence (with the hardship is easy) and the benefit of this affirmation is to achieve the frameworks of this promise; Because it is a strange news.Among the interpreters who made the secret in the first sentence is the world, and in the second sentence, the last is easy, and the Arab words are not used to it.Because it is an affirmative for the second to be sure.This is the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: ““ He will not be difficult to see.” And it was stated in some of his narratives that he read this verse at that time, and the victims are distributed to the extraction It benefits from the definition of the word of the hardship and its return is defined and from the denial of a word that is pleased and its repetition is denounced, and they said: The cure is the denial, if it is returned, then the first is the one, then the first is the first Al -Lakhd is known for a knowledge, and the second is the first eyes, as he said: (As we sent us to Pharaoh, a messenger [Al -Muzammal: 15] and he cursed the Pharaoh: And by building their words on the rest of the denunciation, defining a mistake; Because that base is to restore the denial, not to return the known knowledge, and it is specific to the knowledge of the covenant without the mother of the gender, and it is also in the return And in the verse, it is not a return in a second words This is taken, and it was its heroes before the father of Ali al-Hasan al-Jarjani in the book of the systems as in (P-416) the tendency of the download.And the owner of the scout also invalidated him, and he made the son of Hisham in the sinner of the Libyan, that base was wrong.And who appears in the report of the meaning of his saying, “It will not be difficult for you to be pleased” that the sentence (with the hardship is easy) is a certainty of a sentence (so with the arrogance).It is decided that what is meant by asserting the sentence in its example is the affirmation of the judgment that the news includes.There is no doubt that the judgment that benefits from this sentence is the confirmation of the ease with the hardship of its crops, so the affirmation was useful, and the effect of the effect of the day, Permanently, he expressed the formula of dedication in his saying “Yusrin”, so the triumph is here as a symbolic structure of the domination and the righteous, for the sake of the risk, for the sake of the risk, for the sake of it The frequency that is intended to multiply, as in the words of the Almighty: (Then return the eyesight two crops that turn to you, the sight is a miserable, and it is a good one [the king: 4]) Because insight does not flip up with two returns.And from that the saying of the Arabs: your father, your happiness, and your country.And the freshness of the powerful power is required, so the power was necessary to decide the triangle, and if the limb was numerous, the kinna is a symbolic.And that is not benefiting from the definition of the hardship with the imam, nor from the ease of the secret and its repetition.
