the acceptance of Islam from the miserable and the foresters because they prove the God of the one And they follow the virtue of a fight between them in that, so this is limited to them, approaching

meaning of the words is to be excluded from the past verb in the matter of the condition, that is, whoever believes in them for God and does good, for his reward is for him The chapter on the dowry, then they were brought up with the righteous boats, and reminded of them from the nations of those who did not remember them as disbelief for the appropriateness They disbelieve and remind the Jews that they have no good for them, other than the nations until they do not rely on the illusions that they love God and that the sins of God.In this, there is also a sign that the pure believers are from the Jews, and others are among the predecessors of the same as the nurser The art of this judgment, which is that they have a reward for their Lord, because the involvement of the part of the conditional conditional is authorized by the reason, but the predecessor is the same With this condition, the ruling was given, so the verse has passed the right of the two parties.It is permissible for you to be from a connection, instead of the name, and the past verb at that time remains in the past because it is not something that will be saved for the sake Either it enters into the news, the words of the poet, and it is one of the shames of the book of Sibuyeh and the saying of Khoulan: So they marry their deaths, and they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who believes Then they did not repent, so the torment of hell was [Al -Buruj: 10] when it is not Sibu.Either that the connector is treated for the condition for the atheism of the soil, so the fulfillment of the villages entered into that.It is the benefit of the verse at that time The success of Salihi, the sons of Israel, from the ruling, by the harm of humiliation (P-539), the household, and the anger of God, and the remembrance of the rest of the righteous of the nations is that this is upon them.The Sunnah of God in His Performing His Creation and Him, all of his deeds.The remembrance of those who believed in the meter of these, and the status of his saying whoever believes in God with them with them that they are believers, then remember them, so they will be mentioned It is for the believers of the believers at the time, so they are the ones who spend.It was said that he wanted all of him and wanted someone who believes in the lineage for the two creatures and who is clearer

them, the Christians and the young men without the believers, are the ones who are in the past They believed while well.And when there is no need for something of that, because the condition and the prayer were installed from two things: faith and good deeds.And those who are separated, and if their faith has occurred, then the righteous deed was for them.A description of those who are bound to it, each or one.And the meaning of those who believe in God, the full faith, which is faith in the Muhammad’s precedence ﷺ with the reverence of the shrine and the century of his saying, and the work of goodness, as it is the condition of the acceptance of the two years, the faith of the faith, the faith of the faith, It was one of those who believed [Al -Balad: 17] and he promised the unimaginance of faith with the Muhammad’s luxury ﷺ in the house The one who defines with it is a miserable denying God Almighty in that believing, so that the old man is not believed in God, the true faith.With this, it is known that there is no face of the pretext of the fact that this is the verse of the words of the Almighty, and whoever is surprised by the other hand, then it will not be accepted from it [85] The copying of the news is only that God has informed him of the believers of the people of the book and the Sabeans who believe in what the Messenger of God came without Before the mission of Muhammad ﷺ, then the meaning of the verse is as the meaning of “His saying ﷺ while it is mentioned whoever comes to his reward for two times and a man from the people of the book of the sake Runs." As for those who say that she is a bond, I think that she would be interpreted by them that God gave them to the first to meet the call of the Messenger of God ﷺ, until they look at them With his saying and whoever uses a religion that will not be accepted from him [Al -Imran: 85], so that their saying is not subject to the pretext of copying the news.(P-540) And his saying is the Almighty, so they have their reward for their Lord, and the reward is released on the reward, because it is in the interview of good deeds and what is meant by the goodness [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
