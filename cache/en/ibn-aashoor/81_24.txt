The Quranic researcher is on the absence of the adornment of the guerrilla, which is based on your friend, as it is required by the context.Unjustly and false, and the approach of the re -is.And the absence: what was absent from the eyes of the people, or from their knowledge, which is called the source.What is meant is what God has been affected by his knowledge, except that some of his prophets, and from him the neighborhood of the parties, and the knowledge of God, are the attributes of God, and the affairs of God, And it was presented in his saying: those who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3] in Surah Al -Qar.A word was written in the cruisers of the corps of Al -Munsar, with a drop, as the readers agreed upon.It was narrated from Abu Ubaid, Al -Tabiri said: It is what the Muslims of the Muslims have to agree with.In the scout, he is in the journalist of Abi with the opposite and in the journalist of Ibn Masoud with the oppression, and the Shatibi was seized in his system in the drawing on the drawing of the grace of the name.“Dennin” is collected, and the readers have disagreed with his readers, so he read it as a bonus, the son of Amir, Asaim, Hamza, and Abu Ja`far (p-161) With the point of the fall that comes out of the edge of the tongue, which follows the heads, and it is the argument of the painting of the Imam.And the rest of it read it with the shameful mud that comes out of the tip of the tongue and the origins of the high folds, and it was mentioned in the scouts that the Prophet ﷺ read with them, and that is what he does not need, and that is what he does not.Because the two readings were not frequent and they were narrated from the Prophet ﷺ.The scourge and the oppression are different, and the speakers consumed from one of them are different suffering, except for the two “nither And a "ugly", then a thirty and thirteen darkness, and the opening of the H and the opening of the afternoon.They said: They are languages ​​in a word with a single meaning, and it is the name of glue that is said to him: Khawlan.There is no doubt that those who read it with the shawl from the people of the frequent readings, and they are the son of many, Abu Omar, and al -Kisayy The Prophet ﷺ, and that is not praise in their readers, as it is contrary to all the copies of the Historical Cohers; Because the frequency of the reading is stronger than the frequency of the line, if it is considered a frequency of the line.And what was mentioned in the condition of the agreement of the readers of what is in the journalist of Uthaman to be a correct reader that the reader may be permissible, but it is the proportions of the readings that are not.As we have shown in the sixth submission of this interpretation.Abu Ubaidah has apologized for the agreement of the Imam’s Qur’an on her writers with the scourge with the existence of the conflict in it between the opposite and the opposite in the readings, that he said: The book; Because the opposite and the shadow are not different The Qur’an is only by the increase in the head of them on the other head, so this may like him and help me.He wants this speech that what was drawn in the Qur’an is not contrary to the writers of the Qur’an for the frequent readings, meaning that they take into account the disagreement of the readings of the frequent readers, so that the readers are the writings Some of the copies of the Qur’ans on the declaration of the definition of readings, which is the majority.Here, the drawing was annoyed, and the shadow came to the head of the head.I do not see a retirement for that need; Because when the two readings were frequent from (P-162) the prophet ﷺ The writers of the Qur’an intended to be one of them, which is the one who read the rituals of the companions.And they entrusted the other readers to the preservatives of the readers.And if the readers are frequent with the fierceness of the fallen and the (two suspicions) with the shameful uniform, our knowledge is that God has revealed it to the two guys and that he wanted both of the two.As for the meaning of Denin with the opponent, the beast is the one who does not give what it has, which is derived from the perseverance with the opposite, the source of the light, and if it is wrong, and the one who is overwhelmed.It is permissible for it to be with the real meaning, that is, what is accompanied by you with imagination, that is: what is revealed to him and what he tells about the matters of the absence of what is wrong with what he said.He tells you about it only with mosquitoes that you give, and that is a nose of the denial of being a priest or a navigator who receives the news from Jin And they claim that they inform the absences, the Almighty said: What is the saying of a little poet who believe in [Al -Haqaqa: 41] and there is no priest who is a few of the people: [42] The difference is between the state of the priests and the state of the prophet ﷺ with the indication that the Prophet does not ask them to make up for what he tells them about and that the priest takes what he tells about what he tells him This meaning is before the Almighty saying: Say what I ask you for a reward [Al -Furqan: 57] and what I ask you for a reward [Al -Shuara: 109] and the like.It is permissible to be a metaphor of metaphor sent in the killing due to the relationship of the adherence; Because the killing is a good thing with the matter known to the blessings, that is: what is the absence of the unseen, that is: what is revealed to it, and that is that they were saying: “It is a Qur’an,” We will not believe in your promotion until you are revealed to us as a book that we read [Al -Israa: 93].And it is commented on the absence of his saying: two lights.And he drew on this direction in the sense of B, like the saying of the Almighty: a fact that I do not say to God except the truth [Al -A'raf: 105], meaning: the truth of me, or for me.Frequently, and keenness: the intensity of breach and what is Muhammad with a bit of absence, so what I tell you about it is what we have inspired to.Al-Bakhil may be on this as a category, and it is a fennel with another arrangement (P-163) on the authority of the abomination.The meaning: What is your friend with a bit of absence, that is: what Tell you with the right.As for the meaning of (thinking) with the shameful shame, it is an effective in the sense of an act that is derived from the thinking in the sense of accusation, that is: suspicious.It is wanted that it is a misfortune that is bad, that is, it is a liar when it is informed about the absence, and the deletion of the verb is the one who thinks that the meaning of the words is in the sense of the words.In the sense of the accusation, it is a matter of one.The origin of that is that they say: He thought of it badly, and he exceeded his first attachment to the rudder of the B.A verb and they said: In the sense of: accusing it, it is said: I was stolen to me like this and I thought.And he (Ali) in this direction of the salvation of the metaphor, which is in the sense of the custody, is like or found on the fire.It is as it has reached it, that is, what he has reached is the absence in which there is no doubt, and their saying reflects them: he commanded him to do so.
