The Quranic researcher for those who disbelieved the worldly life and harnesses those who believe and those who fear them, on the day of resurrection, and God bless you By referring to the conditions of the disbelievers of the Arabs who are from the preceding verses, intentionally and exposing it from his saying: Do they only look at them, and God will come to them in the shadow of the On them with his saying: (P-294), the sons of Sarayel [Al-Baqarah: 211] is a nursery for the two creation of their creation, which is the one who is subject The recipient of the infidels and its people who preceded the hadith about it, so Ibn Abbas is intended: the princes of the Quraysh, so this is the nose in the sense of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same For the sake of that, it was cut off from the precedent sentence, and it has not been between it and between it, which is registered with it: The book of the book is from the advertisement and the opposite, as it was narrated from a fighter, because it is not from the terminology of the Qur’an to express them with those who disbelieved, and because they were if they were.They have the worldly life, because they are from the children of Israel, and because his saying: and they are harnessed from those who believe in the case of the participants, not the same as the book of the book as it will come.And the decorations: make the thing a decoration or the ugliness of its formation, because the activity comes to make the most of the proportions, such as the learning, and the admission And Zin is the severity of goodness.The worldly life is intended for what life is comprehensive from the pleasures, the mammals, and the good and the good, and this is a famous launch of life and what it aims.In the hadeeth: “Whoever is deserted to a world will afflict it”, that is, to the benefits of a world, and he is on the addition of an added that the defamation of his deletion.And the meaning of the decoration of life is for them, either that what was created as an adulterer in the world may enable their souls and thwart their lords in its charity, because the things are in the goodness جَمِيعِ النّاسِ فَلا يَخْتَصُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِجَعْلِها لَهم زَيْنَةً كَما هو مُقْتَضى قَوْلِهِ: لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا; For the pain feels the choice, or the irritation of its decorations in their souls with a Satanic call that improves what is not like good as the good The desire, and the adornment in the first meaning is God Almighty, except that they are overwhelmed by the adornment, and the decoration in the second sense is the Satan and its creatures.The actor of the decorations was deleted, because the decoration has many things that are many things: some of them created some of the things that are good as the merits of the souls and the correspondence, and from the goodness of the elderly Their souls are not good, such as killing the soul, including their symptoms of those who invite them to accept the beneficial matters until they are confined to the affairs of them.The phenomenon under which shame is if it was a parallel, and from it They embraced them on the ears on the same, without the thoughts in the reconciliation, so that there are things that are reconciled to each of them to be considered an actor for adornment, right This is the same as the male of this actor, as a result of the prolongation.(P-295) It is permissible for the acting to be deleted to his accuracy, as the decree has a hidden matter for them, so he is in detail with his separation to a explanation in their ethics Their souls are attached to the pleasures and others from all that they carried on the relationship with competition or imitation until they are blinded in that of the light of the unjust Specialized, fragmented by the good habits, and they have always made them the weakness of condolence To make the desires, for the sake of their choice in this case without the believers and without some people of the book who have the Lords of them, the people of the people of the The dhimmah by their definition of what is comprehensive of those pleasures from the impersonate and their affairs to take off from everything in which there is an ultimate or later, or for the sake of it.Its ethnicity and reject what is a cupping defamation, and they are satisfied with that of the goods and the time until it has become a kingdom, so this is not decorated with the lowest of them.They have an exposure to the ruling on it with the righteousness of the other, for the other one, for those who know what is in the matter of the advertisement, the back of the light and the dome, The adulterers were specially in them, as what is meant by his saying is decorated for those who disbelieved them and warning about their creation, and this is why the pregnancy of the two years is necessary It is obligatory, so it is necessary for the meant to be decorated with what makes that adornment is a slander, otherwise it is the origin of decorating the life of the world that is the same An order is not a slander if it is taken into account in which God has not been taken into account by his sponsors.I have settled the arms of the adornment, and I confined it to three types: the first is not in the origin of the origin of the origin, neither the same nor a lock, because its whole is the same With the thumbs, the phases of Satania, and the essence of poetry, such as wine.The second: What is a real adornment, but it has consequences that make it harm and harm like adultery.The third: What is an adulterer, but it is a defamation of what he visited as a defamation of the unjust, and he has prepared for me to be analogy for three of them with the saying The boy found you, I did not go away when I will return to me, so I have been the remainder of the harshs with a drink ∗∗∗ As long as you do not rise with water, you will be paid, and the day of the day of the day Babah, under the baptized costume ؎ and be called if the additive calls a gun ∗∗∗ as the lord of the hatred It was alerted it the mobilized (P-296) and its saying and harnessing those who believed) is a kindness on the sentence of Zain for those who disbelieved, etc.Current condition in vanity; As they did not confine themselves to the flower of the world until they were harnessed by those who did not woven from their parts of the believers who are the ones who are blessed When the debt guided them to the duty to leave that in the conditions and types that involve hidden ones.And the mockery of the two conquests: such as joy, and the mockery may be relieved, and its action is as a joy and the mockery of the name, and it is a wonder of confusing, and it is the case of the case, A minor for his life on a psychological description, like a wonder, and it is prepared by a neighbor to the owner of the adherent situation, so it is a way of a lumin Its transgression is a weakness.And their sarcasm with the believers that they have decided their opinion in their symptoms from the pleasure of the compliance In vain, because the disbelievers have believed that what has passed from their life is other than a grace that was lost on them, as there is no immortality in the world, nor the life of it as he said: ؎ And the one who licks the water, he said to me, “Leave the wine and drink from a lower dwelling To benefit the case of the state of decorations in the case of the sacrifice, then the two cases will be tied and appreciated for the starting sentence, that is, they are harnessing, and it was said that it was from the one who was said They harnessed from them a bilateral, age, and lusts who say: These poor people left the world and its female bears and carry the hardships to ask for what they call the last The servant of God is mocked by them.It is coming in the verb of decorations in the past formula and in the verb of ridicule in the form of the horrific form of the right to the right of the significance that the two meanings of the action of the decay of the decree; Because the past indicates investigation, and that the meaning of harnessing is a repetitive, renewed from them; Because the harms benefit the renewal, and it is known that what is achieved between the actual is also a continuous; Because the righteous thing in the soul does not break itself, and it is known that what was continued is also achieved; Because the verb is only able to be able to do the same as its actor and reside in it, so the meaning is in the verse: it is decorated for those who disbelieve and decorate the life And they are harnessed from those who believe, and on this, but it is chosen to do the decorations, especially the past (P-297), and for the act of harmony, the pears of the fresh The two classes with the action that it has is the same; Because the adornment was what was the precedent in the existence and the origin of the mockery, it was It is indicated by verification, to indicate a kingdom and intend in his significance to the recipients of follow -up, and ridicule when it was arranged on the time and was overlooked and it was over.The defamation, as it is not followed by the mockery of it, without it, it has been evident with what is indicated by the recipients and the consequences of its significance on the verge of the significance, because the significance is the significance The one who is the one who is achieved is only achieved.And he said it) and those who fear them, according to which I want from those who fear the believers who were mocked of those who disbelieved; Because these believers were righteous, and it was the necessity of the phenomenon to be said: They are on the authority of them, but it was amended from the guarantee to a name that is unjust to the defamation of the one who is the most important A lies to them and guarantee him a liar and a liability, as they did when they heard his saying, the Almighty, you have brought you up and comforted [Al -Najm: 19] when they found the evil On their gods.So he changed the guarantee to the endowment, but it was not in the name that preceded me (those who believed) to intend Great in this separate, on the usual Qur’an in setting up the guidance and guidance of the guidance to benefit the leaders of those who are believers over those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve, Piety to be the reason for their success over those who disbelieved on the day of resurrection, and the believers are not the righteous, it is not from the excess of the Qur’an that is the case of the Qur’an.Let them be a blood between the severity of fear and a few hope, and this is the usual Qur’an in the same way as this place.The one is here is a difference of supervision, and it is metaphor in the grace of the grace and the pioneer, as it is exposed to the state of the preference, the mockery and the murdered.The day of resurrection was restricted by the elaboration of her in the day, because this day is the principle of eternal life.If you say: How did the believers enjoy from the many piety and say it, they are above those who disbelieved the day of resurrection with faith, and the place is the place The most worthy of the remembrance is here and described (those who believed) I said: As for Bayan, the piety that I mentioned has other occasions.I said: The verse is an illness that the other people do not appear on the day of resurrection, but rather it appears after that, because the day of resurrection is the beginning The righteous does not appear to them, and the infidels do not realize it with sense (P-298).24] Yes, their advantage appears after spending what was destined for torment on sins.It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the verse was descended in the pillar of Quraysh with the Mecca that they were ridiculed from the believers of the believers and their exemptions, so they know that the one who believes in them By God, and God promised Al -Fakri is of status, and in his saying: “Whoever creates” an expulsion of the threeding of the partners by cutting the livelihood of them and the demise of their luck.And his saying, and God provides those who follow the etc.The quarrel knows from this dissenting, which is the meaning of its estimation: and those who fear them are above them, so a great time that is not surrounded by it, because the description is not.Its grace is from the grace of God and the grace of God, there is no end to Him, and because the sarcasm of those who disbelieved those who believe that they were ridiculed by the poor of the believers.And the calculation here is the restriction of the estimated, so the denial of the account is a denial of the knowledge of the abundance of liveli With the injustice, and the enemy surrounds it, as a result of the few, and its saying: something that is not counting, and that is true that the account is exiled here from something that is not reasonable, and it is the one who is reason Al -Khatim: ؎ What do you think of you, you will be given it ∗∗∗ in the sleep, it is not a source
