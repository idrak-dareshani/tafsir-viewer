The researcher of the Quranic disputes, the activity, and the swimming pools, as the precedents are preceded, as the municipalities are a matter of a day, the leg of the shift is followed by the one who is the one who is the heart of the ritual Beach.It was initiated by the oath with the shades with great attributes, a division that intended from it, achieving what is after the news, and in this segment, the division is made.These are the five things that are divided by a crowd that they have been memorized in the form of the collection with a thousand and a number; Because it is in the interpretation of groups in which the enthusiastic adjectives are achieved, they are groups: (P-61) disputes, activists, siblings, princesses, rabida, so that there are adjectives A deleted manner that is referred to is the righteous descriptions of it.It is permissible to be the characteristics of one of the types of one type that has items that distinguish those attributes.It is permissible that the descriptions of the different types of types will be that every characteristic is private from the characteristics of the characteristics of the great supplies.And which is required by the majority of the recipients that the sympathy with waws is independent of the descriptions of different types of types or types, or for one of the conditions of one of the conditions Multiple, and that the afflictions of fulfillment are separated from the description that was overwhelmed by the fulfillment, for it is the characteristics of the one who is separated from the bit of the bit.One is a division in those great conditions by administering their descriptions.For the one who is one of the interpreters, there are statements in the appointment of the descriptions of these descriptions and in the interpretation of the suffering of the description It is intended for it, and it is not intended for the other description, and that every characteristic is fulfilled by the fulfillment of being another condition for the goodness of the wow.And we will be fed up in that the appearance of the faces and their organism, and we remember the difference in that of the sects so that the view will be at the time of the sake of insight.And this scatter is intended to go to the understanding of the Samaids, every place that is possible, so the sections of the suffering are multiplied in the insulting, and the arrogance is developed and the seed is the good Meaning in itself in which it has more severe and that of the abundance of suffering with the summary of the righteousness.The disputes: a description that is derived from the conflict, and the suffering of the conflict, all of which are returned to the exaggeration and attractiveness, so it is a truth and it is metaphor.It is necessary for disputes to be a group of angels, and they are assigned to the tribes of the souls.The rak'ah, and it is their saying in the dying: it is in the conflict.And their class was held on the form of the seizure of the interpretation of the group or the kindness as the Almighty saying: The Arabs said that we believed [Al -Hujurat: 14].(P-62) This is on the authority of Ali, Ibn Mas'oud, Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Marsouq, Ibn Jabir, and Al-Saddi, so God was divided by the angels, so that the angels are divided by the angels.She specialized in this description, which is a reminder to the participants; As they are in a disbelief from the hereafter and after the death, and because they are severely attached to life, as he said, when he mentioned what he mentioned, and they found them, and those who are exalted, and those who have the people of the people.[Al -Baqarah: 96] The participants are like the love of life.And the division on this direction is appropriate for the greater presentation of the surah, which is the proof of the resurrection; Because the death is the first of the other homes, this is from the consumption of the consort.Frequently: the name of the source of the sacrifice, and its origin is ancient, and it came with it in the way of the prodigy.His source is the one who is the eye of the word, but it was made for the export of the export and was deleted from the narrators.And if we said: He dwelt into his eyes, lowering and nurturing the bodies with (active, praise, precedent, and command), it was a neck; Because the weaving of the medium is reduced by the silence, and this is a source of which a minor source is described by a reaper, a divorced woman, that is, a ritual, that is: That is, it is removed from the far reaches of the bodies.It is permissible for disputes to be a row for the Najoom, that is: it is removed from the horizon to the horizon, that is, it is easy, it is said: it is removed to the thief, that is: it is inclined and tied.Frequently: it is similar to the stars of the stars in the water, and the good said, and the mortality, and Abu Ubaidah, Ibn Kaysan, and the light, and it is on the authority of this.And to hold his eyes to be reduced.And the division of the stars in this state because it is an appearance of the appearance of the Rabwani capacity, as the saying of the Almighty: and the Najd if it is fell [Al -Najm: 1].It is permissible for the disputes to be the archers of the arrows in the conquest, it is said: we are removed in the bow, if it extends it when the arrow is placed in it.This was narrated from Akrama, and a gift.“ The religion of God, and the Muslims were not for the sake of the Mecca on the day of the conquests, nor did they hope for it, so the oath of it is a warning to the polytheists with the invasion of the invasion of the way, it was in the invasion Their shackles, so it will be from the evidence of the prophecy and the promise of God, and God is His Messenger ﷺ.And the intercourse: It is permissible for the chapters to be the activity, which is the power of divorce for work like the fast.The activity is called the walking of the brutal revolution and the path of the camel for the strength of that, so the Sufs will be either the cakes on the face of the way to the face of the way in the way Its circles, either the invasion, or the angels that accelerate the exile of what God has commanded from the matter of formation, and both of them on the face of the truth, and any It was overwhelmed by the conflicts of the kindness of a kind of kindness or kindness of a lining on a lick.And (active) is a source that came to the source of the one who did the one from the door of victory, so he believed that (the intercourse) are active actors, it is prepared.It may be a subject to the will of the real activity, not the metaphor.It is permissible for a confirmation to be achieved to achieve the description, not to raise the imitation of the metaphor.On the authority of Ibn Abbas: The angels are active, the souls of the believers, and from it are the souls of the believers, active to the elderly.And (Al -Sabihah) is a rival of the permissible praise, and the origin of the swimming pool, which is the transfer of the body on the face The good angels who are in the atmosphere of the heavens and the horizons of the earth, and narrated from Ali ibn Abi Taleb.It is permissible for the horses of the invaders to be intended when their attacks on the enemy quickly, such as breaking the swimming pool in water, such as the sacrifices in the saying of the qais, describing the chaos: The dust raised the dust with the kick (P-64) and it was said: (Al-Sabiha) Al-Nujoom, and he is on the authority of those who interpret the disputes with the stars.(Praise) is an affirmative source to benefit the verification of the crops to its intensity to the greatest.And the compassion (the cabinets) of fulfillment is permissible that this adjective is separated from the one before it; Because they are kind to the fulfillment of the attributes that some of them are separated from one, as it was presented in the saying of the exalted The money is mentioned [Al -Saffat: 3] and the saying of Ibn Zubaybah: ؎ He has a zipper of the height of the generous ∗∗∗ Praise the cloud, so the grace is so (so the preachers) are the preachers.And the precedent: The brigade is the one who walks with him and his prayers to the place that is before him before him.The precedent is called the speed of the arrival without the presence of a walk with the past.60].The precedent is called overwhelming and oppressive, and it is the saying of the Exalted: the mother of those who have exposed the chapters to make them [Al -Jaltiya: 21] and the saying of the one As if you were not preceded by a day, if you realize the one who was asking and said it to the Almighty: the precedents are before the sake of the sake of this The bearers and description of the sacrifices are appropriate for all its modes of its own; That the brochures want a quick walk, while knowing it, or the principles.And if (Al -Sabihah) in the sense of horses were (the precedents) if he was carried on the meaning of the speeds as a nursery of the splendor of the people with their enemy and their urbanization, or to the righteousness of the righteousness The meaning of their predominance.He emphasized the extensive source of its meanings, which is (precedent) to confirm and to the renovation of the greatness of that precedent.And the mobilizers: Sufism with mobilization.(P-65) and the mobil: the two thoughts in the consequences of things, and by the status of the work on what is worthy of what is found for him, if you are the sides of the angels, then we will not be able to do so.With its entirety on the most complete of what I have been authorized, and he was expressed by the mobilization of matters because it resembles the action of the exalted And if the siblings are the horses of the invaders, then what is meant by the mobilization: the mobilization of the bares of warfare from hatred, a flesh, a laurel, a killing, a capacity, and a right to the virgin.And the support of the mobilization to the siblings on this direction is a mental metaphor; Because the mobilization of the arsenal, but the horses and the question of the exhaustion of the mobilization, as the Almighty said: And he authorized people in the pilgrimage, they will come to you as a man, and for every guarantor of the rituals of the pilgrimage 27], And the two admines were given to the guarantor of every guarantor [Hajj: 27] from the camels; Because the argument is from the deep chicken, it is the same as the camel.In this metaphor, there is a gesture to the deletion of horses and the speed of its understanding, as it is the minor, as if it is the mastermind of what its charities managed.And the matter: the important thing and the incompatibility, and its core of the greatest, and its individuality to the will of the sex, meaning: things.And the group (disputes), and the plates) if the archers, the beauty, and the charitable groups are understood from them, that it is a sign of the types of fighting, and the archers are from Persians on the horses, and the archers were walking the feet of the charities, and they turned away from them until they were informed of the place.Annaf ibn Zuban al -Ta’i said: ؎ And the slope of the horses opened a man who has a man who is available to the hearts of the hearts, and it is possible for the verse to be carried out for this.By threatening the partners with a war on which it is the conquest of the conquest of the Mecca or the invasion of a bird like Surah (and the raids) and its damage, and it is from the noble, and it is from the These threations were their comfort and their exposure in the period of his position ﷺ in the Mecca and Muslims in weakness, so he obtained from this oath to suffer from a torment.And the sentence of the day of the shivering of the man is to (the obstacle), the answer of the division and the wise words (P-66) is a preacher.And what is meant by his necessity, which is the resurrection of the resurrection; Because the hearts are only in the bodies.It was known that what is meant by the day of the shivering is the day of resurrection; Because he has been known for the same as these conditions in many verses, which preceded his descent, the same as his saying: If the land is made [the incident: 4], then the answer is in this.The resurrection, and in its fold, it will be achieved, and it will obtain a summary in the words of a gathering between the warning of its fall and the warning of what is in it.On the day of the shivering of the manner, it is attached to (an outfit), so that the person who is intended to be investigated is the one who is going to be achieved by the mission of the mission in Aslaw The denials of the expression With the department’s department, as the division was indicated by some of his conditions that are from his parents, and he was in the answer to the division.And the course of the answer is not counted as the answer to the division, after the answer between the answer and between the division with the height of the sentence of the division, so he appears to me from the one who is in the abuse of the richest The answer does not come with the words of the division in the answer, and from that the Almighty saying: and the sky with brokers [Al -Buruj: 1] to the killing of the people of the numbers [Al -Burujah: 4] The division is in his answer, unless the answer is loyal to the sentence of the division, and it is for you to sure that your idols [Al -Anbiya: 57], so your Lord is to ask them for the sake of the one who is the one who is: 92] A nominal sentence that did not compare it with the words of the answer, and I did not see the permissibility with his parallel or by his prevention, and if the owner of the singer was noticeable in the analogy of the one who is in the way And if they believed and feared for a representative from God, the best [Al -Baqarah: 103] that the mother is the mother of the answer, a deleted oath, and it is not the same as the answer (La).The name is a little from the answer (if), so the sentence of the answer was not seen if you are nominal to be associated with the blame.The owner of the scouts made a follower of the frequency, and others are the answer to the division, deleted, its estimation: to be sent.The disobedience was presented to his attachment; Because that cursed is the most important in the answer to the division; Because the intended is the proof of its fall, so the custody is presented to the pace of it and its care for it, for when the words confirm the division of the one who is the one who is the one who is the most important That cursing, and affirmation is a fulfillment, and then that the custody is confirmed in the sample by saying: (The day), which is (the day of the shame of the man) is the way) With this news.(P-67) and Al-Rajhah: Al-Mustaba, Al-Mu'tazzah, and its action from the door of victory.And the appearance of the words of the people of the language is that it is a short verb and did not see those who said: It is used as an aggressor, so this is permissible to be a chain of transmission (the ritual) to (the ritual) (Al -Rajaf): Earth; Because she is obliged and is disturbed by the earthquake that is obtained by the death of the worldly world and the destiny to the other world The earth was shaken by the incident: 4] and the legacy (the man) is because it is the land, and then it means that the pharmac is followed by the other man.Because the description of the legacy requires the fall of a man, the window is a second drying, followed the first dryness.It is permissible to be a chain of transmission (a tremor) to (the man), a mindful metaphor.What is meant by (the man): the shouting and the earthquake that the land shrouded with the cause of it was made, the wrapping is free, such as their saying: Ashi is satisfied To say it: it is followed by the pharmacist, meaning: that is followed by the man, that is: the caused by a cushion, that is: a satellite after it.It is permissible for a teeth to be a slogan for the severity of the voice, so the voice is seen with the stretching, which is the earthquake.It is a manner (the man) to be interpreted by the case or the juvenile.And it follows the pharmacist: the following, it is said: it is added in the sense of follow -up, and the response: the follower of others, the highest said: I am extending you with three thousand thousand of the angels: The first shift follows the second, so what is meant: a navigator from its gender and they are the two blows that are in his words, the Almighty: and we are blown in the pictures, so it is stunned in the heavens and the one who is in the heavens We are blown in it, so if they are standing, they see [Al -Zumar: 68].A sentence is followed by the pharmacist.And deny (hearts) to multiply, that is: many hearts, and that is a starting spot, which is a denial of the will of the type.(P-68) And what is meant: the hearts of the partners who were unhappy with the resurrection, then if they rose up, then know that what the Messenger promised them ﷺ in it is a right that they would have come from The denial of the mission and the evil, and that is not from them.As for the hearts of the believers, they are in reassurance, varying according to their attempt to piety.And fear is the day, even if it is not free of it, except that the most sufficient fear of those who are certain of the misfortune of destiny and know that they were lost in the life of the world.And the definition: the obligatory of the fear, it is said: it dried the stroke, the dry, the fool, and the hollow, if it is forced.And (dry) news (hearts).The sentence of its eyes is a second, a second news from (hearts), and what is meant by the brightest has increased its saying: its eyesight is humbled, meaning: the eyes of the people of the hearts.And the fear of its truth: the subjugation and the humiliation, which is a form of human being, and the description of the sight with it is a metaphor in the eagerness and the view of a hidden way of the severity It is witnessed by the illness of the transaction, the Almighty said: Their eyes were rushed [the moon: 7] in Surah (the hour was approached [the moon: 1]).And the same is the saying of the Almighty: and the faces of the day are a secret [Resurrection: 24].And the addition of (vision) to the guarantee of the hearts to the lowest installation; Because the sight of the people of the hearts, both of them are the prey of the bodies, the same as its saying: except for the east or its sacrifice [Al -Nazidat: 46].
