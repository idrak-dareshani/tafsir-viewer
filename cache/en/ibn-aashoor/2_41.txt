The Quranic researcher (P-458) and believed in what I descended as a sincere of what you have in the call of the children of the children They prepare their souls to accept it as the presenter is presented to the extent, and the abuse of solidity.And the belief in the book that is revealed by God or the books of God, and if it is from the sentence of what the covenant covered by the covenant referred to him with his saying, and they will fulfill the covenant: That side because they have pledged to God on many things, as it was presented and from the sentences of faith in the messengers and the books that come after Moses, the peace of God It is not necessary for him to be what Muhammad ﷺ is what they have pledged to God, but rather until they believe that he is from God and that the one who has the Lord of God is from the one Believe here.He turned his saying and believed in his saying and my people, and they are frightened.Before the kindness of the private over the year in the sense, but this is the kindness of the sentence, so it is not said in it for a special kindness for a year because it is in the kindness of the part of the part of the one who is in the past The sentence, but we wanted to bring the summary of the sentence, and its revenue is brought in it.And in the relationship of the matter in the name of the communication, which was revealed without it, other than the names, the part of the book or the Qur’an, or this book is a gesture to the command of the command of the matter, and it is the one who is the one who is in the faith They have given faith in every book that I have been revealed by God.This is why he came to the case that is the cause of the prayer, as he made it a charity for what is in the Mawarma, a mark on that it is from God.It is the religious mark that is appropriate for the people of science from the people of the book, so he made the righteous miracle a mark on the universe of the Qur’an from God for the family of the family He referred to him by saying the pain [Al -Baqarah: 1] that book [Al -Baqarah: 2] to his saying, and they came with a wall of the like [Al -Baqarah: 23], as well as he made the miracle of the meaning of the one who is The divine books are the knowledge of it that it has the people of religion and knowledge with the parts.Then faith in the Qur’an is obligated to believe in the one who came to him and that he descended.And what is meant by the books of the fourth mortar and what was followed by the books of the prophets from the sons of Israel (P-459) as the zabur, the book of the people, and the people, Choose the expression with what is on the authority of the one without this, as it was expressed in the positions of this, because in the books of the prophet after the peace of the Prophet, peace be upon him.What is in the stream it was The alert to it was signed.What is meant is from the color of the Qur’an is true to what is with them that it is covered by the guidance, which has called to them from the neutrality and the command of the virtue and the abuse of the ritual And back, preaching and stories; So what is similar to it, then its command is back and what is different, but it is to disagree with the interests and the juices with the entry of the whole of one of the origins.Therefore, this is called a copy because the copy is the removal of a steadfast judgment, and it was not called heroes or a lie.With them because it calls for the violation that the rulings of the rulings will be changed to change the conditions of reconciliation and the spoilers because of the disagreement of the hurricane in terms of the one who will be the one who will be His time, and that is not heroic, and not a lie.Faith in the Qur’an does not contradict their entirety of their debt, nor the precedent of their messengers taking them to the covenant by following him.From what is included in the narration of the Qur’an, because of them that the attributes that the Qur’an and the religion of Islam are deducted from them, according to what he wore, so that he will be blessed with it.A miracle of their prophets and another belief in their debt, and it is one of the bodies of their remembrance, the pride and the good, so it is necessary to be interpreted by the confirmation of the truth.Inform the informant about opening the b on that the news of the expert is a junction of the occurrence of the occurrence, either by saying that you believed or believed that, as it was mentioned in the hadith of Jabril in Sahri On the authority of faith, Islam and charity that when he told him, the questioner said: “You believed, he said, and we liked him to ask him and believe him.” So his second news is credible for the first news.As for the release of believing in the significance of something on the truth of a news, it is a metaphor and the intended and the Qur’an and the Qur’an in its form is a believer in what is not with it, and it is not true for what is with it.Religion and prophecy as it is not hidden.* * * (P-460) Do not be the first disbeliever in which the gathering of the guerrillas is in the formation of a disbeliever that indicates that what is meant by the disbeliever is a jurisprudence, no The first addition to a Biany infidel benefit the meaning of a separate person is the first team of the infidels.And the guarantee that is the one who is in it, in which it appears that it is a follower of “what I descended” because it is the intended.It is a kindness on a sentence and believe in what I have been revealed, and it is a promotion in the supplication and the abolition of hearts Or with the last, and they were known for the severity of the religion of Islam, and they are kind to their command with the faith of the Qur’an, and they forbade them from the first of you.With some of it, it is beneficial from The right of the installation and some of it is from its boundaries and some of it from its consequences, and all of them are destroyed by the verse.The precedent is otherwise, so he will obtain from the kind of kindness, affirming the sentence that is given to it by the preservative, and it is forbidden for the infidelity with the Qur’an.I descended, then the first description of the end of the prohibition with descriptions, but the hornship of the context indicates that it is not wanted to inform the one who is forbidden by the one who is forbidden The infidelity, as the intended is not from it, the forbidden from it is that they are in the infidelity, nor do they keep it, other than them, for a few seriousness, and that is the one who is the one who is from it The first of the believers is the most beneficial of that with the way of the Tillenic Kniyeh Because of the first meaning of the first meaning, because it is some of the consequences of the word, and when faith and disbelievers are two things if one of them is exempt, the other was proven, then the forbidden is that they would be the first Be the first of the believers.What is forbidden is that they will be delayed in following the call of Islam, so this is the compound that may be with him from two meanings, from me The initiative to Islam and the meaning of the storm that is forbidden, so the meaning of the forbidden is intended and necessary, and it is the matter of the initiative with the faith and it is the meaning In which the obligatory and the defect gathered together, so the absence of the obligatory will be the forbidden in the sense of the matter, and the matter is confirmed by the matter that he accepted as if it was said, and they are not.The believers; And by administering the obligatory, it will be forbidden after the disbelief, after the faith, so that it will be presented.(P-461) This is an explicit, because the abuse of the kinary meaning is not the imposition of the clear meaning, and this is the one who used it in the realization The judgment referred to it is not the abuse of judgment, or that the ruler will be in it, and it is not the rule of it.This direction is based on the appearance and verification between the spread of their words in the known exposure of the kinna, and the two questions are imprisoned with this.Before him: The first is how it is correct for the forbidden to be the first of the disbelievers and his concept, it requires that if they had disbelieved in it secondly, they would not be disbelieved.The second is that the people of Mecca were preceded by the disbelief, because the verse of the cow is in the speech of the Jews.It is forbidden to be the first of the disbelievers to obtain a hack.The impulsion directed that the most intense is the expatriate meaning, which is It is based on the intention that the intention is forbidden to be among the beneficiaries of disbelief, that is, they are not delayed in faith, and this is the first of the faces in the annexation The scouts and his choice of white, so he was confined to it.He knows that the exposure is in the special and description (first).And the exposure from the way of the Talniyah, because it is in the secret of the resignation from the meaning to its balance.And some of the exposure gets from the readers of the conditions at the height of the words, and perhaps this is not described as a reality, a metaphor, or a naughty, and it is one of the consequences This is the increase in Payan at his saying, and there is no wing to you, while you presented it from the speech of the women [Al -Baqarah: 235] in this surah.The second meaning is that the intended is to be inflicted on the participants and that they are more unbelievers, that is, they do not be in their priority, and perhaps this is the intention of the owner of the scout, and it is the one who says that It is wanted and do not be the same as the first disbeliever in it, which means those who have been blessed with the people of Mecca, and he does not want that he likens him to a pyle, even if his words are delusional and silent about him.(P-462) The third meaning: that it is intended from (first) the benefit and the urgent, because it is from the first boundaries of the first as he said, so I am the first of the people who are the ones.[Al-Zukhruf: 81] Al -Dabi: So they called, so I was the first to come down and what I kneel if he did not go down, then say it.He turned with people, because if the people call the people, we will remove all of them all, but he wanted to be who did not wait.It is the meaning and do not hurry with the permissibility of disbelief before the contemplation, for what is meant by the disbelievers is here the silence on it, not staying on what they were on the authority of it, and it is the same First.The loyal meaning: to be (first) as a result of the pot in the matter because the presidency and the owner of the brigade, and their signs, are presented to the people, and he said: 98] Khalid Bin Zuhair, who is the son of the sister of Abu Dhiib Al -Hadili: ؎ Do not be broken from a year that you have made it ∗∗∗ and the first is a year from the one who is not.For a year.And the meaning and do not be a comparison for the disbelievers of your disbelief, for if you see your disbelief, as disbelieves, to be fed up with you, and this is also a fabrication of the individual.The fifth meaning: that the first intended is the same as the second preacher, which is the supplication in the city, because what after the migration is a second case for Islam, in which the appearance of Islam, in which the appearance of Islam, in which the appearance of Islam, Informed.This is all based on making the tone of the boundary in its saying (disbelieving in it) is based on (what I have been), that is, the Qur’an, which is the phenomenon, because it is a remembrance of it.Concluding faith in it.It was said that the destiny is based on what is with you, and he is the one who said: Ibn Atiyah said: And on this saying, he comes the first disbeliever, upright on his appearance in the first one, and he does not hide that this is not hidden.It costs that it is a follower that their disbelief in the Qur’an is the one who came to the part of what you described the supply and the books of their prophets in their lights with a book of Bennab If they lied to that, then they disbelieved in the health of what is in the dew, then it leads to disbelief with them.Al -Tafizni said: This is all, but it is fulfilled, even if their disbelief in it in the sense of their claim is that it is all a lie, but if they disbelieve in it, they will be the words And he lied, so he would not take place, and for this this direction was a desirable, and Abd al -Hakim returned it to what he did not fit.(P-463) With this all it is clear that his saying and do not be the first disbeliever in it, which is not deluded from him that the negation is a place on the one They are the second of a disbeliever or a third of the disbeliever in the cause of the phenomenon, and that the first disbeliever is not before the description of the description until it is equal in the negation And that he is not mentioned as the saying of the Qais: A few times, this.* * * And do not buy a few times a few who are at the end of which before him, and this forbidden is directed at the scholars of the children of the children, and they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the same On the acceptance of the call of Islam, it is their fear that their presidency will be removed in their people, so they were showing the denial of the Qur’an to fulfill their in general.The presidency of them, the Prophet ﷺ said, “If ten of me believed in me, all of them believed in me.” They bought the misguidance with the guidance [Al -Baqarah: 16] and it is the same as the same as the same, or the validity of it from the two critics and the like, as well as the money of money and the sheds, and it is not the same.Another thing is without sequence.And the verses are the collection of a verse and the origin of it in the language of the homes or on the way.The verse is on the pilgrimage, because the argument is a mark on the truth.The Messenger is a verse, as in his words, in the nine verses to Pharaoh and his people [Ants: 12] and if you do not come to a verse [Al -A'raf: 203] and they were released from the same The Qur’an said that he is the one who brought you the book from it.The fasting, “You will be satisfied with you.From the conversation in the hadith of the ritual in the saying of the one who is the good of the school, it is a matter And among the perseverance, that their symptoms from the verses of the Qur’an for the sake of the leadership of the chaos, and the benefit in the world is similar to that of the muddy, in that it is not given what it does not need it His argument and his benefit in it, in it, in it, you will be bound by a verdict in the verb, and it is permissible, as you buy a metaphor sent by the relationship The restricted in the divorced, as it is presented in the saying of those who are those who bought the delusion with the guidance [Al -Baqarah: 16], but here is the arrogant, and it is not possible The relationship of the like, and the use of the similar relationship from the aspect of the face of the entirety to the metaphor to the metaphor, because the intention of the likeness is sufficient in the nomadic The suspicion is from the purposes of the rhetoric.To the verb with itself, and the other rituals were made, the hemorrhoids are called, and the verb is called the verb to it with the meaning of the meaning of the mosquitoes.The verses were the location of the sake of the whims, because the fruit is the entry of the B is, so the entry of the B.The recipient, and the remembrance of the costume of the resolution because it enters into the fruit and does not correct its universe, as it is not in the right of it, then it is not the right of it.B is, here is the way of the way of the silence in the response of the pioneer to the place.It can be imagined.Another is that it is said that you do not buy a few verses, so he brought the words to the rivalry of the opponent and express the enjoyment and its grace with the same To resemble this muddy from the presidency or money by eight, or because it resembles the frustration in his being, humiliating and wreckage that has been made by them, and in a good matter, and in a good matter, and in a good matter, and in a good matter, and in that it is a good thing in that They were fools, when they have gone out of anything and took a little luck, so both the two buddies were in the verse, similar to the eight, except that the verses are in the same way.(P-465) on the subject, and the enjoyment that they take He likened to the eight in his place, something that is obtained by every one or for the sign that each of the verses and the either is a matter that is on a partner, so the verses are on the authority The general public, and he specialized in the right to give it the true memorial that indicates that it is a humiliation.The last, and because when he was overwhelmed in the release of the thickness of the two critics, the launch of that is on what they take, and that they will be given to the sake of what they take from the money that they take the money from the money.The legitimacy is like his saying, they take this minimum.It was said that his saying is the same as the Qur’an in his saying and do not buy and his face is that when the Baa was entered into the verses, it is that the verses are the same.After it, with a thirty, effective, to do the knowledge of the Samaid, that the first is not with a right to eight After that, too, it is not with a realistic eight, following the knowledge of the metaphor in the verb that is afflicted with it.It was said that his saying is a thirty and his report is the same as the report of his two villages if we made the two centuries to say it with my verses.It was said that it is a nomination because the utterance of the good is the perpetrator of the purchase, which is close to what we presented in his being is upset because the nomination is in itself, it is possible It is for the numbers of the likeness to all the numbers, all of which indicate their ignorance and their readers.And the verses do not exaggerate their self, so they seek the value of added, that is, do not be bought by the acceptance of my verses at the same.And adding verses to the guarantor of the majesty to the honor, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Arafa said: The great verses of the verses are the gathering and the addition to the guarantor of the majesty and the custodian of the And the description of the few uh, that is, and that is in the abundance of their companions, as they repelled a precious person with lust and say and described (a few).Wasting the verses is a little, even if it was a greatest funded by the lineage to what was lost by that of that fruit, and on this meant, he will be pregnant with the words of Ibn Arafa.The rituals that the verses were completed, and the president did not show the presidency or the bribes that they take in order to include that of the disagreement of their conditions, so they are in the way The intentions that they confront from following Islam on the behavior of their destruction.(P-466) And he described a few years by saying a few, which is not intended to be pious in terms of the prohibition on the authority of taking a little budget without the time of his money, For the one who is taken from the one who is in the past, then every thirty is in the side Shabah with the exile of the bodies The restriction is to help the exile of the restriction and the restriction together, as in the famous house of the lime of the Qais: ؎ On the love of no love, it is not guided by its light ∗∗∗ if it is the rest of it.He has it, so he will be in it because the appetite is necessary for the fire, and the saying of Ibn Ahmar: ؎ The rabbit is not lost.From its ears and there is no fool with it until it escaped, and the saying of the jungle: ؎ The same is the bottles, and it was not removed from the eye, that is, an eye that did not see until it is done; Because the scandal is necessary for the eye of the eye and the same is a lot in the vicious words.It was fell (then a denunciation in the end of the end, and it is like a nose, and all the compensation included, as the verses fell as a whole, and every verse was included, as the verb was signed.Every day, the action is like denunciation.And the discourse, even if the sons of Esaril are not that the Qur’an’s speeches and its stories related to the other nations are only intended to be intended to be the adults and the preacher, so we will be walked It is in the first way because we are the first of the psychological tails as a bad thing said: The free one is perhaps and the stick of the servant and the brochure of the brief Revenge, our scholars are forbidden to come to what we have forbidden by the children of the elders from the truth about the right to the purposes of the world, and so was the same.From here, a question was imposed by the interpreter, which is attached to his verse, and if it is related to it, it is weak, and it is a question that takes the wage on the authority On the authority of the lease on the knowledge of knowledge and on (P-467) some of what is in worship such as the call to prayer and the imam.And the saying in it is that the public is one of the scholars.Al -Shafi’i, Ahmad, Abu Thawar and Al -Jamour, and their pilgrimage in that authentic hadith on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet ﷺ said, “If you have the right to take it to him,“ Its verse is on this meaning in this way; Because what is meant by the objection is in it is the metaphor of the metaphor, and it is not in the teaching, no one, no, or a waste.The son of Rashid has transferred the gathering of the people of the city on the pity, and perhaps he wants to gather their jurisprudence.And in the code: there is no goodness on the leave of the Qur’an.And that was forbidden by Ibn Shihab from the two followers from the jurisprudence of the city, Abu Hanifa and Ishaq ibn Rahayah, and they touched the verse, and that the learning is like that So it is not taken from it, and what was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet ﷺ said: The Qur’an And the writing, so I will give me a man from them, and I asked the Prophet ﷺ and he said that your secret is to be touched by a tall from a fire, and he accepted it.The learning is appointed to him, and he refused to be rewarded, and there is no evidence for what the Qaribbi answered.To disrupt a lot of knowledge of a few who are spent in that, because the most of them cannot be capable of it and the carrier of the hadith of Ibn Abbas, after that, after that The Quran is kept.The learning is an in transcendent worship, so it is permissible to take the reward on that action, and this is a influential separation.They are their chain of transmission, as the Qaribbi has shown it, I said: I do not calculate the Zahri, so it is attributed to their ideals, nor for the verse, nor for that measure The delay of the Hanafi was delayed in the palace of taking the wage on the knowledge of the Qur’an and the jurisprudence.And jurisprudence.And the origin is that the wrath is not permissible for us to obedience and sins, but when the brightness was in the religious matters, the fraudsters were delayed.Take the wage on the call to prayer and the imam, Ibn Abd al -Barr said it is a taken from the question of the reward on the knowledge of the Qur’an and their ruling is one of them, and in the code of the one “ Prayer, the wage on the call to prayer is only, and the son of Abd al -Hakam is approved by the imam and his face is that it costs the prayer in that place in that time, and it is not the same.Because of the reward for the wages of Ramadan, and its hatred in the family, the Qatibi said, and its rituals, Abu Hanifa, and his companions, and in the custodian, and the day of the day, and the day of it, and the day.The imam and the ears are forced to pay the payment of the wage and be loved.Malik because it is a contract of measures from the perspectives, so it is not permissible for the ruler to bring in it one person because the reward for the prayer is for him, so if he takes it for it, he will be taken away from it.It is a built -in origin at the origin of it, and he presented it in the four -year -old team I warned you to me, so the truth is that hatred [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
