The Quranic researcher who eat usury does not only stand as the one who is hidden by the Satan from touching that is that they said, but the sale is the same as the Lord and the best of God A preaching from his Lord, so he ended, so he has what he preceded and his command to God and whoever returns, for those who are the people of the fire, they are in it.The Qur’an is the most important of the memorization of the nation’s money in your way, the verses of the verses, so after that it started with the greatest of those origins, and it is a measure of money for the nation of the nation, from the mother of it.The money is just as much as it was a preference for the wealth, and it was imposed on people, and it is taken from their song Violating, which is charity, so he was discouraged in urging it, and the desire for its rewards, and warning in his hold, in which there was a preacher of those who have been exhorted It was one of the causes of the riches of the songs that needed them (P-79), and it is the treatment with the goddess that the Prophet called ﷺ the ignorant usurc, which is that it is given the money On the destiny of the debt for the sake of waiting, then if the term is dissolved and it is not paid in the debt, they say: Either you spend it, or you are raised, and it was so that it was a great.The jurisprudence, and the most promising that they were taking the usury on the debt from the time of his Islam, and the more he asked for the look, he gave another Lord, and perhaps he would forgive some of them in that Required is famous for the missionaries in the ignorance, and it came in the speech of the deposit: “Except that the ignorance of the ignorance is a place Required." The sentence of those who eat usury is normal.He came with the communication of the significance of the cause of the news of the news, which is his saying: they do not stand up to the last.And eating in the truth is the eating of the food, then it is released on the integrity of the thing and took it with a morale and its origin is a representative, then it became a truth, so they said: Those who eat the money of orphans [Women: 10] and do not eat your money [Al -Baqarah: 188] and does not specialize in taking falsehood.In the Qur’an, if you have a soul from it, then they eat it.[Women: 4].And usury: a name on the weight of a verb by breaking the fulfillment and opening the eye, so that they might be afraid of the Lord - with the extension - so they made it the name of the source of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord.The mosa is on the measure, as in the chapter, the guarantee of the pioneering and the cousin, as a lion, and the abbrence of the breaking of the Arabs and the extension like the throw: if it increases.He said: So do not raised with God [Al -Rum: 39] and he said: I was divided and raised [Hajj: 5] and for his formation from the ones of Waw, I will be on the authority of Rabwan Looking at the pharaoh of hope in it, because the breaking of the Arabs, then he folded it for the sake of the fracture as well, he said Al -Zajaj: I have not seen a mistake that is fabricated from this, that the mistake is not enough for them in the line until they made a mistake in the trinity, how are they reading and what you have come from With a opening on the waw in the municipalities of people [Al -Rum: 39] refers to the readers of Asim and Al -Amash, and they are kefan, and their readers read the people of the kufa.(P-80) And the usury was written in Al-Muhsaf, whereby he fell after a thousand, and a thousand, and a thousand people were written.That is, it is raised by the scourge of the waw, and the foolishness is the opposite of the affairs, and this is far away, as the disturbance is not a language of Quraysh until it is written by the companion, and he said: The difference is between usury and adultery, and it is a distance because the context of the words is not left to be suspicious of the meaning Learn the line from the people of the Lira, and they are a tuning, they say in usury: Raboo - with a hook owet - so I got as well, and this is a distance of all.And that when the companions wrote it with wow to refer to its origin, as they wrote the folds that were disturbed by the ya in the middle of the words, with the merits of the words, as if they were in the words, as if they were in the hands of To make the drawing referring to the origins of the words, then they hurried, and he would not be repeated in their drawing, and for that, they wrote the zakat with wow, and they wrote to the prayer The origin of it is the kneeling from the sacrifice of the two prayers, not from the stalemate, and the owner of the scouts said: And then they wrote a thousand people that likened it to the gathering, and for me, there is no one for me Rather, they wrote the thousand after it, in order to put the thousand at the waw, as they put the transfer from J, a thousand, according to the ya, so that the people do not read it.And I want those who eat usury here whoever is on the religion of the ignorance, because this is the return and the disgrace that is only appropriate They cracked from them as long as they are on their disbelief, but Muslims have preceded their legitimacy with the prohibition of usury by saying the Almighty: O, those who are safe, do not eat.Double [Al -Imran: 130] in Surah Al -Amran, and they do not say that the sale is like usury, so God made this return from the sentences of torment, especially for the disbelief Their disbelief from the place of usury.And all of that offends the Qur’an on the people of the ignorance to give them the usury, and it is one of the first things that the Qur’an called upon them in Makkah, so he came in the Surah of Romans The numbers of people do not raise them with God and what you have given zakat that you want to face God, for those who are the weakened [Al-Rum: 39] (P-81) and it is the rhetoric of the An angel, and that after the verse, God created you then then Your Excellency, then he will die, and then he will protect you from your partners who do from you from something [Al -Rum: 40].One of the habits of the Qur’an is to remember the conditions of the infidels on them, and to be inflicted on the eminence of Muslims to deny them the conditions of the people of the disbelievers, and he said: The Qur’an is one of the conditions of the infidels, so it is also intended to warn the Muslims from the like in Islam, and for that, God Almighty said: And whoever returns, then those who are the people of the people, and they are the people of the people.And God does not love every sinful disbelief [Al -Baqarah: 276].Then he turned to the discourse of the Muslims and said: O you who believe, fear God [Al -Baqarah: 278] the verses, and perhaps some of the Muslims did not suffice from the Lord, so that he will not stop By saying the infidels: The sale is like usury, so the verse of Surah Al -Amran was the principle of the prohibition, and this verse was closing the door of the excuse in Your circulation is what it has been preferred from.And usury falls on two sides: one of them is the predecessor with an increase in what the predecessor gives, and the second is the predecessor with an increase in a period of time, it means if it is not fulfilled At the time he had to increase a increase in it when they are agreed upon at all time.And his saying: They do not stand up to the rise of the exhibitor and the recitation, and they release a metaphor for the improvement of the situation, and on the power, from that: the market rose, and the rumor rose, and the rumor rose, and the rumor rose, and the rumor rose, and the rumor rose, and the rumor rose, and it was The exile here is the true resurrection.The one whom the Satan is tied, and if the resurrection is the meaning, the meaning is either that they are kept and their activities in the customers of usury, such as the resurrection of the madman, who is disgraced, and he said, It is permissible for this to be the meaning of what people like to be in their state of residence and the abundance of their money, and the strength of their merchants, with what is the same Until its disruption is strong, the movement of the movement, with the fact that it does not possess something for itself, for the verse is on the real sense and a feast of them with the sake They enter the fire, and this is the back and it is the appropriateness for its saying: that is that they said, but the sale is like usury and it is in the metaphorical sense (p-82) The pain and the domination of life are under the image of a serenity, which is straightforward.And the disturbance is folded (his confusion): if he is stripped of severely, he was obliged to him, that is, he moves a strict movement, and when he was necessary, this movement is the same The human being forced to be consistent, then they intend to do the patronage and make him transgressive to an effective if they want to be dismissed, and he did To say that he touched it, and they are hidden, they say: you make it wrong.As they said: He forced him to such.So the Satan is disappointed, making it hung, that is, it is destroyed by consistency.And the devil is the madman who has been stolen, and he is forced to be forced, and he will fall on the ground if he wants to do, so when he is like the same The similar body is preserved, with the syntax for the significance of it in their words, otherwise the form of the similar body was understood, and it was not the same.I was transmitted by the activity and the speed of the traffic, after that she walked a full night: and it was permissible for the fool of the secret, as if it had not had a sect of generosity, and the name of the prayer is in the name The touch is a rabbit, and if it is released, defined by the covenant of a known touch, it has a good time for them to touch heaven, and they say: A man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man, His saying from touching to appear to appear from the Satan, so he does not think that he is a slaughtering of a metaphor in the sense of the bonds, and from the “obedience to the” مَحالَةَ.This is when the disgrace is a neighbor on what the Arab covered, like his saying, as if the heads of the Thiartans [Al -Saffat: 65] and the saying of the righteous: Agwal.However, this is a viewer and his highest imagined, and the other is imagined because they deny the effect of the demons, without the bosses, and when we are the same The urbanism is only from the case (P-83).It is permissible for us to be all the heart of all of them, and it is established in the original from the cries of the hooks, because the hearts of the crowds - like the signs - did not reveal it now Future connections are the sources of universe and corruption.And his saying: That is that they said, but the sale is the same as the sign of significance, as it is based on that (what) is a source and a captivity.And the one who says about them by saying: They said, but the sale is like usury, if it is a linguistic saying, so what is meant by it is the saying of some of them, or the saying of their people, and the saying of the people, They thought badly, so they understand that the deprivation of usury is obligatory in the time of the distance of the sale, to mean that the Muslims are fascinated in the validity of the rulings of the Shariah, for the sake of the rulings It will be everyone who ate usury, he said this words, and if it is a proper saying, where everyone who eats usury says if he asked him a question about the face of his abuse, and he is the one who does not.(They said) Mutal; Because their argument is equal to the goddess of rabies, he is obligated to say it, so he called the saying and I want to do it, which is the one who is able to do it.And their saying: The sale is the same The violation of their ruling was forbidden, so the Lord was forbidden and the sale was permissible, and when it was stated in it with the proverb, the same as it is said that it is said: The sale is the same as the Lord, as it is said.It is not said: The phenomenon is that they say, but usury is the same as the sale, because it is the one who was intended to attach it to it, as in the question of the scouts and built on it, it was made of the words of the words, We say: They are not the same as the ride of the vocals to the origins of the measurement of the measurement, but rather they were hoping for usury and selling, so they are in the danger of the sake of them.By prohibiting usury and keeping the sale on the porn, then the sale is then at that time to their recklessness, so bring it to him to prove the pornography It is forbidden by usury on the way that is called the chapter of the opposite, because the opposite measurement is that it resorted to the end of the view, not in the end of the view, not in the time Especially itself.(P-84) And they wanted to sell here, selling the merchants, not selling the need to make it up with the heads of his money.And his saying: And God has permitted the sale and deprived the usury of the words of God, the exalted as an answer to them and the Muslims.Who are the rulings of Islam, which is a persuasion for Muslims that what the infidels said is a curtain likeness, and that God is the knowledgeable, and this is forbidden, and this is what is this An arrogant, if the people of the mobilization are managed, they would have left the difference between the sale and usury, and in this answer, it is not a revelation for the young, so it is what is from what is the one who is all of it.The believers, with the remembrance of the deprivation of usury, is the nest of the urbanization of the charity, it nods the lip.And he knows that the building of the likes of the two said, but the sale is like usury that the merchants have a increase in the price of the sales of the purpose of the merchandise in the correspondence For those who seek the sake of the abuse, then for the sake of the sake of the rented sale, then if it is the same as the tenth of its tenth, the same is the same, for example, that it will be brought to it.He may have given him this increased dirham for the sake of preparing his money for those who shed it; Because the loan is confronted for its lending and preparing its money for its sake, then for the sake of that it is waiting for that after the place of its sake.And the revelation of his suspicion has been shocked by the lock, and he said: Whoever sold a garment of twenty -twenty years, he has made the same garment, and he met the two of the two.This is the one who is twenty, a mobilization of the millions of money.The twenty -tenthly loan is not a compensation, and it is not said that the increased is the compensation of the vigor; Because the vigor is not money or something indicated To him until he makes him compensated for the twenty -tenth.And the reference of this separation is that it is a repetition of an advertisement, as it is a minor separation.The pride indicated in the ruling of the rule of the prohibition of usury to the other separation of its white and freedom, and it has the fact that the one who pledges allegiance to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a twenty -year -old Al -Mashtari enabled the benefit of the sale either in itself, or by merchants with it, then that is the increase for the sake of those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the pilgrim, or the authority of the ritual He paid their dirham for the sake of the ear, so it did not collect (P-85) more than more than the money that he took.It is not said: It is capable of leaving it, and it is permissible because this is a good man who is not achieved.Appreciation.This separation is close to the separation of the lock, but it is necessary for it that the assessment of the one who is supplied with money is in it in which it is bridging his needs, so it is the benefit of the muddy, For the trade of the loan, or by the subscriber authority, it is a brilliant matter in it.The face is in the separation between the sale and the Lord that it is referred to it to explain the thought of observance of the difference between the two cases of the supplicant and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the opposite and the one The need for the opposite to spend on itself and its people because they were preparing to support themselves and anguish, and the prophet was used from him ﷺ and the state of merchants is the case.The case of the backward and the seed, so he is in the best money for those who need to be intended to benefit from what they pay from usury, and he increases them Because the weapon is the suspicion of the need, you do not see it, there is no money in it, and the state of the sake of the sake is a merchant in the event of the one who sheds the hardship of what is the one who needs it, and the one who needs it.They have a supplication for them with their humiliation with them, for him for what they have in money, for merchants are a treatment between the richness To him, the singer is the thought of the poverty, and the cheerful is the richness of the wealth, so this is forbidden by the usury because he used to seek the need for the poor, and the best of the good is for the sake of It turns out that the lending is one of the types of sympathy and the known, and that it is certain that the appointment on the one who is obligatory or a mandate, and whatever it is not permissible for the loan to the one The well -known, as for the one who lends money to leave him or to expand his merchants, he is not the suspicion of the pilgrim, so he was not among the people The rich must lend him in any way, so if he lends him, he will be volunteed with a well -being, and this is enough for a separation between the two cases.The pride mentioned for the rule of the deprivation of usury for four reasons: the first of which is that he took money without compensation, and he was mentioned in it in the separation in the separation Between the sale, which is a difference that is not.(P-86) Al-Thani: In the use of usury, what prevents people from improving the hardships of assumption in the acquisition; Because if the owner of the money is used, the usury will be taken away from the acquisition of the living, then if it is seen in the people, it will lead to the objection of the benefits of creation; Because the reconciliation of the world does not remain except with merchants, industry and architecture.The third: It leads to the decadence of the well -known between the people by lending.The four: that the majority in the lended is to be a rich and in the stable to be a poor, so if I would praise the Lord, the rich would be able to take the money of the weak.And we have seen when he passed through the difference between usury and sale to the cause of its prohibition, and we will be simplified by that when he said, O He, O you who believe, do not eat.130] From the Surah Al -Amran.This and the verse has been subjected to judgment, which is the solution of sale and the prohibition of usury, because it is from the words of God Almighty to declare this legislation after the exaltation of the one.And “the” in each of the “sale and usury” to define the genius, and the ruling of two of the great two of the great people in it, in which there are two great wisdoms in it, in which they are in it, in which they are: The first of whom is permissible, as it is a need for the nation, and the second is forbidden, whose pilgrims were canceled because of what he had exposed to the spoil.And the appearance of the defamation of the gender is that God has permitted the sale with his tongue, so the solutions include the path of His individuals, and that he forbade usury with his people, and for the sake of God.It was in the power of a case, so the sexual intercourse was not required, and a consolidation did not seek the purpose of the exhaustion of its resurrection in the grace of the The inclusion of the solution to the birds of the sale of sale, and when the sale may be adopted by the reasons that require its corruption and its prohibition, the project follows the reasons for its sacrifice Take advantage of this verse.As for the meaning of his saying: He forbade usury, it is in the ruling of the exile because (he was forbidden) in the sense of prohibited, so it was required to seek the gender of the Lord of the Plain; As he does not exalt him with permissible.Then the scholars of Islam differed in the fact that the usury was kept in the verse remaining on the same known in the language, or it is transmitted to a new meaning in the terminology.“ Sama: “Rubness in the humanity” and he did not take what was mentioned in the proof of the Lord of the grace with a woman who is a woman.God sells over his general.As for the scholars, they went to the fact that the usury is transmitted in the knowledge of the law to a new meaning as There were many hadiths on him, and until this is the way of Omar ibn al -Khattab, Aisha, Abu Said al -Khudari and the worshipers of the son of the fasting A new one and not all of the meters of it indicated, as if he had what the camel likened to, so Ibn Rashid was narrated from him in the old man who said: He said: He said: He said: His Messenger is the verse of usury, so the Messenger of God died and did not explain it, and you are claiming that we know the gates of usury, and because I know it, I love me from me And its cores.Ibn Rashd said: And Omar did not want that that the Messenger of God ﷺ did not explain the verse of usury, but he wanted - and God knows - that he did not pray with the Lord, and he said: Al -Arabi: The Messenger of God ﷺ the meaning of usury in six and five hadiths.And the face is that it is not the intention of Omar that the usury is beautiful because it was met by the two and the interpretation, but he wanted to achieve the ruling of the ruling in the ruling of the ruling in the ruling The prophet is permitted by elaboration, because the advanced do not be crowded in their expressions of what the suffering suffers from, so the people of Hanafis are the same.Singing, and Ibn Al -Arabi mentioned in the struggles that the people of the hadith are expanding in the sense of the Bayan, and in the interpretation of the pride from the Shafi’i that the saying of God: The usury is one of the compliments that is not permissible to hold on to it, that is, with its generals: the general of the sale and the generalities of the usury, because if the person is the gice of the sale and the bond of the olive Ziada, and if it is intended for every sales and every increase, then there is no goodness, in which there is an increase, then the first verse permitted all of the brilliance, and the last of it is forbidden by the whole, so the ritual of the ritual Peace be upon him, who carried the public on the expression of the preservation of usury, used in a new, hadith that was answered and replied to the Prophet ﷺ from a saying or a verb that is a matter Yes, from the ignorant goddess, who is known to them before Islam, and its origins were reached by six hadiths: (p-88) The first hadith: the hadith of Abu Saeed Al-Khudari: With righteousness and barley with barley and passing with dates and salt with salt, likewise, like a hand, so whoever increases and increases, he has been raised, and the one who is given in that.The second is the hadeeth of the servants of the son of Al -Samit, “The gold is golden, its eyes, its eyes, the silver, with the silver, its confusion, its eyes, and the righteousness with the righteousness with the stretch of the hair with a long time And the exercise of dates is a period of extension and salt with salt with a period of time, so whoever increases and increases, he has been raised, nor is it bad by selling the gold, and the silver is for the sake of time.The human being is not, "it was narrated by Abu Dawood, and he called it in these two hadiths as Lord.The third: The hadith of Abu Said: “Bilal came to the Prophet ﷺ with a yearful time, so he said to him: From where is this?And the Messenger of God ﷺ said: Oh, the eye of the usury, do not do, but if you want to buy the dates, then sell it, then buy it from this.The fourth is the hadith of Al -Muwati and Al -Bukhari on the authority of Abu Saeed and Abu Hurairah, “The Bin Bin Ghaziya came from a good time, so he said to him.He said: O Messenger of God, we take the saa from this with the two and the three.Fifth: The hadith of Aisha in Sahah al -Bukhari: Trading in the wine was a work of the forbidden verse of usury and not in the merchant of wine, meaning of the meaning of the usury Sixth: The Hadith of Darqatni - and a son of Wahbah narrated from Malik - that the highness of you is the one who prevented and came to the city from the kofa, and Aisha did not tell her that he was a good time Bin Arqq in Al -Koufah is a neighbor with a domestication of their dirhams to the giving, then if a good sold the slave, then the high of it was brought from it with a resurrection, so he said: And what you were bought, the absence of the increase is that it (P-89) has been his jihad with the Messenger of God, except that he repents.She said: I said to her: I saw if I only took my money?She said: Whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord, then he has ended, so he has what he has preceded.Aisha made him from usury, and that followed the verse.For the sake of this sixth hadiths, the jurisprudence has proven three types of rabies in the terminology of the law: the first: the ignorance of the ignorant, and it is an increase in the debt.The second: the Lord of the best, which is the increase in one of the two rituals in selling the class with its types of items from the items mentioned in the hadith of Abu Saeed and the worshipers of Ibn Al -Samoun.The third: The goddess of women, which is the sales of something from these items with a similar example, and the money increased, and it is a luxurious one: which is what is affected to one of the categories, with the rawness of the Lord, And he attributed it in the code with the bottom of the deadlines, and the indication of your money in it is the hadith of the high, and from the scholars who claimed that the preservation of the usury is included in every one who is a good news The merchant of wine, and the money of Ibn Al -Arabi.And when I showed the doctrine in this, the son of Ibn Abbas, and that the hadiths of the interest of the grace are carried on the hadith of Ashma: it is the usury in the human being.Let the two hadiths be collected.And the name of the virtue of the goddess in the hadith of Abu Saeed and the servants of the son of the silence is a sign of what we said, and that what your money took care From the abuse of what is leading to the treatment of usury if it is issued from the arguments of the accusation, a good pace, and what is meant by the exodus in the past, and it may be taken from some sayings of money The accusation does not invalidate the contract.I do not hold in the context of the hadith of Aisha in Zayd ibn Arqq, because the Muslims in their first command were the closest of the era of the ignorance of the ignorant And in the interpretation of the Qaribi: The Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan was gone until it is forbidden to sell the gold with gold and silver with the silver, but it is a virtuous, but it is the one who is in the heart of the Al -Mudaruba, neither in justification nor in the desired, and a Muslim narrated from the servants of Ibn Al -Samit, he said: We invaded us and on the people Muwadiya, so we will sing a lot of richness, He went, so he was commanded by a man by selling it in the people of the people, so the people were rushed in that, so that the servants of the son of the fast On the sake of gold with gold and silver with silver except whether both eyes with a eyes, whoever increases and increases and increased the rabbit.They talk about the Messenger of God, the hadiths that we witnessed and accompanied, so we did not hear it from it?And Ubadah ibn Al -Summat said: Let us talk to us what we heard from the Messenger of God, even if he hated it.And it is publicized that the verse was only intended from the ignorance, and that what he prepared from the false transgressions in which all money in falsehood is leveled in other evidence.And his saying: Whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord, then the verse is ended.A separation on the one who is in the saying of those who eat usury.And the coming in the sense of knowledge and rhetoric, meaning: who knows this return.This is an excuse for those who are sent on the treatment of usury before the prohibition of the prohibition to it.And the end of its end: if it is repulsed by what it does not fit, as if it is derived from the prohibition - the guarantee of the noun - which is the mind, and the meaning of it is what he prevailed: His contract, and he did not accept, with the following sayings: If you repent, then you will be the heads of your money [Al -Baqarah: 279].And his saying: He commanded him to God, and they would be imposed in it, and he will return to the return of the guerrilla to (whoever comes to him) and some of them to his return to (what he has gone) Because he is the intended, and that the meaning and command of God is to God, that his penalty is on the end of God, who will be assigned to God Almighty, and this is from the delusions that are intended, the one who is the one In his two centuries, his interviews are on the hand in his saying: Whoever returns, these are the people of the fire, they are in it.The follower was made immortal in the fire, either because what is meant is that it is the saying of his saying, but the sale is like usury, that is, it has returned to the sake of usury and that is a hypocrisy, so it is a lot From them, they have left them to leave the handling of God, so God has known from them and made their closure of them from him as an emirate on the lies of their faith, for the sake of their faith What is meant to be the one who is in the manner of the goddess, and it is the appearance of his interview with his saying: Whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord, then he ended and the immortality: I ask her, and how to ask us ∗∗∗ deaf, empty of what shows her words, and from him: God immortalized the king of so -and -so.(P-91) And he grabbed the backs of this verse and the like of the Kharijites, who say that the biggest is the greatness Then we descend the Qur’an, as people are close to their covenant with disbelief, and there must be among the evidence of the book and the Sunnah.
