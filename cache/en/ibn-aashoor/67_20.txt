The Quranic researcher is this one who is a changer for you to support you without the mercy.The imposition of the proof of the divine, the right to God, with the Haddaniya, and its reminder of them that they are bound to Him, transmitted to the heights that one of them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one God promised them with them, and he guided them to them (P-41) to indicate one of their idols or otherwise it is said in it, this is the one who will support them One of them is the one who is approved by one of that, unless they massage the way of fading, and what they are in the same way is like this to make his matter.And this speech is caused by his saying, I believe in the sky [King: 16] The verse, as it is like it is an argument between the pretexts of the recipient.And (Umm) The interruption is not separated by the meaning of the questioning, and it is more than that it is an estimated, so if it is stated to it as it is here, then it is clear and it is not clear that it is clear that it is not.It was a questioner with anxiousness, so he would form a luggage.And the questioning is used to eliminate the concern, so it is based on the consequences, and the indication is referred to it to the concept of a changer who is present in the insults, so it is invoked.As if he is present in the outside, the addressees are witnessing, and the one who speaks to them will seek a tribe that they say: the sons of Flas.And when the interrogation was used in the miracle, it was obligatory, that this outgoing soldier is unaware.And close to that saying the Almighty who is the one who intercede for him except with his permission [Al -Baqarah: 255] and his surroundings.And (who) is in a starting position and the name of the sign is informed of the beginning.It was written in Al -Muhsaf (security) by one name after the gossip, and they are Mim (Umm) and Mem (who) of the two bounds by making them like the word, as well as the word, as well 1] With one name after the eye, and it is only read by a tight name; The one who is considered in the narration of the Qur’an without the book, but the Qur’an is written to insult on its reference.And that is a clinic of a description of the name of the sign, and (for you) is a characteristic of (a soldier) and (your victory) is a sentence in the position of the situation from a soldier or a second characteristic of (a changer).It is permissible for the name of the sign to be referred to it to the group of idols known to them in the manner in the Kaaba and around it, which you took it as a sold God.So that (who) is an interrogation that is used in the compassion, the same as his saying from Pharaoh in (P-42) a reader, then it is clear (who) and raised this.The soldier is more severe than knowing, and the name of the sign is a description of the name of the questioning is clear to him, and which is a pair of you a row for the name of the sign.And the sentence of your victory is a news of the name of the exploitation, that is, it is less than that it will be victorious than the mercy.Come in the nominal sentence It is a changer for you to always and prove it; Because the soldiers are in preparation for victory if they are called to me whether they are dead or did not fight; Because the victory needs an increase in and waged as the prophet said ﷺ: “The best of people is a man holding with the tenderness of his horse as he listens to a hill that flew to me.” The meaning: you will support you with your need to his support, for this is the face of the group between a sentence that is a soldier for you and a sentence that will be victorious and did not seek the abuse of the first.Without his origin, a custody of the lower place against (above), and he is called the Maghreb, so it will be in the sense of other than the metaphor.His saying from the mercy of it is permissible to be a stable cure in the position of the situation from the guarantee that is in your support.That is, the case of the universe of the supporter, on the other hand, without the aspect of God, that is, whoever is able, other than God, the bad will be paid to you on the one who says: “The mother of the mother of them is a mother of them.” 43] So (from) is an affirmative increase in the kindness and it increases with the circumstances other than those who are displayed, and that the circumstances do not leave otherwise (from), he said: Al -Hariri said: And what is stipulated in the custody does not reduce it except a letter.And the righteousness of the Rahman is the following of the preceding verse of the face, which reminded us of the arousal of this description in the preceding verse.And these symptoms say that the disbelievers are only in vanity, that is, that is the one who is the disbelievers all of them and they are the people of the evil from the addressees, and others, that is The misery of God signs the exalted, or in the vanity of their accommodation on idols, as the righteous nations have been deceived by their religion that the seconds will benefit from them and pay them from them, so they will benefit The end of the pilgrim, so that it will happen to their ideals.Let them have no disbelievers with a thirty until they are the apparent place of the appearance.(P-43) and the vanity: The soul thought that it would fall into a good thing that has a traitorous, and it is a disagreement, and it is with the difference of that or it is unlikely.And it is presented in his saying, the Almighty, who will not be deceived by those who disbelieved in the country [Al -Imran: 196] in the last of the Amran and his saying, some of them are revealed to some of them.[Al -Anam: 112] In the cattle and its saying, then the worldly life does not deceive you [Fattar: 5] in Surah Fateer.The perception is action, which is used in the severity of the dressing with vanity, even as if the vanity is surrounded by the surrounding of the custody.And the meaning: What are the infidels in one case except in the case of voices, and this is an additional shortage of their inconsistency hearts that they are in the safest of the caors in the name of the family of God.
