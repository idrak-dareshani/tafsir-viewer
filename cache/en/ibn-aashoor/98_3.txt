The researcher of the Qur’an was the one who disbelieved from the people of the book and the two partners who are dismantled until the sons come to them.The words of the interpreters are difficult to obtain the meaning that is beneficial from these four verses (P-469) from the first of this surah, and it is made, and it is not possible.So the pride mentioned about the one in the interpretation that he said that he said: This is the most important one in the Qur’an in the Qur’an, and the interpretation of the Qur’an.Al -Fakhr said: (Then he did not summarize how the forms are in it, and I say: Which is the Messenger ﷺ then it is the Almighty, it was not mentioned that they are dismantled by what, but it is known, as what is meant is the disbelief and the evil who were the ones who were.Those who disbelieved from their disbelievers until the evidence that is the Messenger is brought to them, then the word (even) is that it is the end of the end; They became disbelieved from their disbelief at the two messengers ﷺ, then he said after that and what was separated from those who have been separated from the book, except after what came to them: [4] Their disbelief has increased at the coming of the Messenger ﷺ So, then he obtained between the first verse and the second verse is contrary to the appearance) uh the words of the pride.He wants to appear that his saying: a messenger from God is a substitute for the evidence, and that the dismantling of the dismantling of the word of the words to Him; Because when they were running on them, those who disbelieved, so that they were not intended to be disbelievers on their disbelief, and if the letter of the absence is required The interpretation of a messenger from God is the end of their dormancy from their disbelief; That is, when the statement is that they will be disbelieved from their disbelief, so how can God say and what separated those who have the book, except for what came from the time.If their separation is due to their separation from Islam, which is the increase in the disbelief, as it is more likely to be a distress that sends the separation in their religion in the religion The disbelief, and this is the last based on the advertisement of its words: and what was separated by those who have been divided by the book [Al -Bayain: 4], etc.Words connected to their symptoms from Islam; And that is the one who was pleased with the patients.We have words that will come.And what the pride did not mention from the face of the forms: that the testimony indicated that those who disbelieved did not disbelieve in the infidelity in a time, and that the stabilization It is based on (that) is a guarantee after (even), and it is required that the evidence is accepted; This is not evaluated, for the evidence was made by a messenger From God and the Messenger of the Messenger came before (P-470), we will go down these verses in the Sunnahs, and they are passed by what they are: these are their disbelief, and they are on their disbelief.And when the face of the forms was decided and it was suspicious that it was the righteous of the interpreters, or a detail, then it was appointed that these words are not, and it is not possible His individuality or his installation, so he must be shown on his appearance, either by a script of the installation of the news about the appearance of the news, which is the benefit of the address That the news is noticed that it is used in the metaphor of the installation, or by the knowledge of some of its individuals, which he is deducted from the piercing of the piercing of the Knaya.Among the interpreters, whoever walked the way of the news of the news of his appearance, and among them who have kept the news on the appearance of his endeavor, and they have the same way as the way of Sarafah Its suffering, and these are among those who are the first to be preserved (dismantled), and among them is the first meaning (even), and among them is the first (a messenger), and some of them are in the authority of the people.The sayings of the interpreters were prepared, and they were informed of a ten -year -old saying, the most frequently mentioned of Al -Allusi, and the male of Al -Qarbibi is great, and it is not the same.Al -Alwsi mentioned it, and one of them increased what the other was not mentioned.And the reference of the interpretation of the verse is to reach five.The first: The interpretation of the sentence with its families is that the news of the news is to the meaning of the stake and the strangeness, and to this the gold, its oil, and the time.The second: the interpretation of the meaning of those who are dismantled in the sense of the exit from the glory of God to them and their destiny to their disagreement; It is for Ibn Attiyah.The third: the interpretation of the attachment of “dismantled” that it is the infidelity, which is to the servant of the mighty, or from the agreement on the infidels, which is for the pride and my father.Or those who are separated from the testimony of the Messenger ﷺ in the honesty before his conversion, and he is for the son of Kaysan Abd al -Rahman, who is nicknamed, or the deaf, or the one who is in the deaf, or from the deaf, It was attributed to some of the linguists.(P-471) The Fourth: Tawil (even) that it is in the sense of the communication.And appreciation: even if they come to the evidence.Fifth: The interpretation of (a messenger) that he is a messenger from the angels who recite a newspapers on them with God They have a book from the sky [Women: 153], and he attributed the pride to my father, Muslim, and he requires the news of the news to the recklessness.This is what is meant by those who disbelieved from the people of the book that they disbelieved in Muhammad's hall Express the people of the book [Al -Hashr: 11].And you do not want to return the sayings of the interpreters to this handicapped, so we do not need to develop it by mentioning it, so you will return it if you want; So we are concerned with the interpretation of the verse on The indicative face.These verses have returned to the resurrection of the Hajj on those who did not believe in the people of the book and on the partners that they are from the right to the truth A stubbornness, so let us forget the news of the good of the pilgrimage.Using a metaphor on the way of the messenger, which is installed by the users of the news in the construction and the interrogation in the time and the part of that, who said in it Al -Mutawil: Bayan is that any of the types of metaphors is what one of his parts did not come around, and who confronts the honorable master of his patronage in what is not in it.This words are a marketer, the arrest of the transmission of the arrogant statements that are obligatory, which indicates the consumption of the opinions of their companions, so it is from the story of what they were, then they are the one who did not As if it was said: You used to say that we do not leave what we have to do until the evidence came, and this is an expulsion of the wise man in the lords of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The complaint is one of the experiences of the expert, and it is a dear sequence.And close to it is the saying of the exalted: the farmer warns that a surah be revealed to them that he tells them with what is in their hearts, say, they are mocked.He crossed a form of warning, and they are wary of warning, and they were not truly.(P-472) The news is directed to every liquid, and its guarantee is a saying.They invite them to follow the Judaism or Nasraniya, and they say: A messenger did not come to us as you came to you.Their studies are for two heedless [Al -Anam: 156] or say if I would have revealed the book to us, because we were devoted to them [Al -Anam: 157].The people of the book were decided that the prophet calls them ﷺ for Islam.The fire is eaten [Al -Imran: 183].And his disgrace from the two parties is a village that what is meant is from his integrity with the argument, and therefore the expression of the harmonious harms in the saying of the saying: Approval of the sad, so they were saying that before the coming of the Messenger ﷺ.And close to his words, the Almighty in the people of the book, and when a book came to them from God, it is true to what was with them and they were before they were open to those who disbelieved, so they disbelieved, so they will disbelieve, so they will disbelieve.[Al -Baqarah: 89].And the meaning of the meaning: that you were saying we do not leave what we have from the religion until the evidence comes to us, that is The mark that we promised.He has made it a gift and a slowdown in his saying after a messenger from God that recites a cleansing newspapers, etc.And when the signed of this verse becomes clear and its forms were raised, let us take to the interpretation of the verse.The jaws: the lock, and it is folded, if it separates it, separated it, and the meaning of it, the meaning of it, and the dislocated by the dismantling of the omitted; He referred to him and described the speaker of them with the connection of those who disbelieved and appreciated: those who are disbelieved from their disbelief and those who are left to him, whether they were disbelieving in the same way The partners or were disbelievers in the Messenger ﷺ This saying is an authenticity of the Jews who are in the city and the villages that are around and the partner of the partner.They cut off from contact with the people of the book since the call of Islam appeared, they are in their savage conquest that they are shed with (p-473) from the one who is on the authority Islam, as well as the partners who are around the city of the Arabs, such as Jahna and Jet, and from the righteous of those who are victorious in the Mecca or the city.And God narrated from the Jews that they said that God has pledged to us not to believe in a messenger until he brings us a nearby.God is true to what was with them, and they were before those who were overwhelmed And he preached a messenger who comes after me, his name is Ahmad, so when he came to them with the evidence, they said this is a clear magic [Al -Saff: 6].And he said about the two parties: A lot of the people of the book, if they would return you after your faith, disbelievers, envy from themselves, after them The two participants said: When the truth came to them from us, they said if not for the proverb, like what Moses was given [Al -Qasas: 48] and say to them, let us come to us with a verse.The people of the two writers did not differ that the covenant was taken upon them by waiting for a prophet who would support the true religion; His signs were made, showing him from his call, such as the saying of Al -Tawarah in the travel of Tashaneh: (I have a prophet from the simplicity of their brothers, like you and like you).Then he said in it: (As for the prophet who wants to speak to him, he will not speak to him, so that the Prophet will die, and if you say that you are in the heart The Lord did not speak to him, so what the Prophet spoke to him is in the name of the Lord, and he did not happen, and he did not worship, so it is the words that the Lord did not speak to him).And the Glory (and I ask the father, and he will give you another comforter to stay with you to the forefront), that is, his project; Because the same prophet does not stay forever (the spirit of the truth that cannot be accepted by the world Because he does not see nor know him), the one who is the fourth of the poverty 6 (and the comforter of the Holy Spirit that the father will send in my name, then he knows you All that I said to you) (Al -Ishah Al -Rabi Shoh, the fourth of the fourth of the poverty 26).And his saying: The prophets of a many lies - that is, after Jesus - and many who are virtuous, but he who is patient with the end - that is, he remains until the path of the debt His religion is that no one remains alive to the infliction of worldly - so this is saved and stormed with the wickedness of the rocks of this in all (P -474), which is a testimony of the martyr - That is, the end of the world -) (when the righteous and the twelve), meaning: the conclusion of the messengers as it is clear.And their inks had offended the interpretation of the stomachs mentioned in their books with the standing messenger, and they entered signs that they know the Messenger ﷺ from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The dreamer, so those who left them are waiting for those sedutes, so if they did not find them, they lied to them.And the evidence: the clear argument and the mark on the truth, and it is a name that is transmitted from the description that runs on the appeal because it is a bond of testimony or the verse.Perhaps the congregation of expressing it here is because it is the best of what the phrase falls in the books of the people of the book, which is what the meaning of the testimony of the sacrifice is the same In the exaggeration of the time (a testimony of all nations), (and perhaps the commitment of this word here is two times that had this special).It was mentioned with the mention of the first newspapers in his saying: They said if there is no time for us from his Lord, you did not come to them between what is in the first newspapers [Taha: 133].And it is clear that the awareness in the structure is to know the elderly covenant, and it is that it is intended with a certificate with its kindness, not with its personalities as their saying: enter the market, not the market.Rather, there is no market in it, and there is a saying of Zahir: ؎ The war is only what you have known, and you have been taught, and that is the scholars of the rhetoric: The knowledge is in this way; As if it was said that they came to show them evidence.It is permissible for the curiosity to be for the sake of the expert from them; That is, the evidence that is the commandments of their prophets, as it is with a grace of every group of them, and if they disagree in its imagination and go back to the illusion of what they do.The word of the building was rejected because it expresses the meaning mentioned in their words, and therefore we see its material developed in many verses of the Qur’an in this Qur’an in this exaltation in this exaltation as well The first thing is that what is in the first newspapers [Taha: 133].And he said: When he came to them with the evidence, they said this is a clear magic [Al-Saff: 6] (p-475) and saying: After what was revealed to them the truth [Al-Baqarah: 109] and he said about the Qur’an from the Qur’an Hoda and Faraqan [Al -Baqarah: 185].And (from) in his saying: From the people of the book, Bayaniya is a bayan for those who disbelieved.Rather, the people of the book were presented to the partners here with the disbelief of the participants more severe than the disbelief of the people of the book; Because the people of the preceding book are in this place, they are the ones who have spread among the entrepreneurs, the semi -arrogance The prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ with what was mastered from the junction of the polytheists, as the participants were illiterate and did not know anything from the conditions of the messengers and the parties; When the Muhammad al -Muhammad shocked them, so they disappeared to the Jews to receive from them what they responded to that supplication, especially when the Prophet was stolen.What is meant by abuse is the case of the people of the book, and the partners are followed by them.And know that it is permissible for the words to be the end of his saying: until the structure comes to them, so the stand is there and it is the saying of it: An eaten, nurturing, and the saying of the chapter, meaning: it is a messenger from God, meaning: because what is in the evidence of the dignity enriches the question of a liquid about the authority It is an expulsion between a sentence, and those who disbelieved from the people of the book and the participants were not disbelieved to the last and between the sentence and what was separated by those who dispersed [4].It is permissible for a messenger to be an allowance from the evidence, so it is necessary that it be from the fullness (evidence), so it will be from the story they claimed.I want the heroes of their excuses and the residence of the argument upon them that the evidence that they wait for it has resolved, but they do not manage or do not describe or not.He said: When he came to them, they came to them, they disbelieved in it [Al -Baqarah: 89].And the denying (a messenger) for the nihilism that is intended to facilitate what is difficult for the denunciation of its saying: the days of the number of numbers [Al -Baqarah: 184] and the saying of the sucking is the book of the book.And in this clarification of heroes for their excuses, as if it was said: The evidence came to you, at the end of his saying, the Almighty: to say what came to us from the evil, and there is no evil And a vow [Al-Ma’idah: 19], and it is beneficial (P-476) that the evidence is the Messenger, and that is the same as the saying of the Almighty: God has revealed to you a male of a messenger who recites the verses of God.So this response is the same as the heart of its saying: And they said we will not believe in you until you have been relieved of the land of the earth.[Al -Israa: 90] And a grapes, and the rivers are exploded through it.From a decoration or ritual in the sky, and we will not believe in your promotion until you are revealed to us as a book that we read it, say the grace of my Lord.They believe in The guidance came to them, except that they said, God sent a messenger of a messenger [Al -Israa: 94].In this, a reminder of their mistakes, then their books are what you are only prepared by the coming of a messenger with a project and a book of truth (And make my words in his mouth).And the saying of the Gospel (and reminds you of everything I said to you) as it was presented as a nose, which is what he said to him.[Al -Ma’idah: 48] Because the mortality and the evangelization did not describe the prophet with it, except that it is like Moses or the like of Jesus, meaning that he is a messenger who is revealed to him, and that he is a messenger who is a messenger to God God and his lives, and that his mark is the truth as it was presented as a nose.The pretext of Islam said in the book of the resistance from the misguidance: “The group of virtuous ethics was in our prophet to the end of miracle, and his miracles were an absence in the shadow.” And from God, he is attached to (a messenger), and he did not ask the add -ons to come to come to me (a messenger), so he feels the greatness of this Messenger.And a sentence recites the presses, etc., a second characteristic or a state, and it is a combination of bleeding in the Qur’an, as it appears that the messenger is in it in the books of it, and it is not described Purification.And recitation: the return of the words without an increase in it, and we did not shorten it, whether it was written or embedded words from the back Words do not change its provision, which is the revelation that is revealed to it.(P-477) and Al-Sahaf: Al-Ardaqs and Al-Hasris that are made to be written in it, and be from tenderness or skin, or from a rag.The name of what the Messenger recites is a metaphor that is met with the relationship of the eel; Because he is commanded by his writing, he is at his recitation, he will be a newspaper; This metaphor is like his saying: I see my wine is wine [Joseph: 36].This is a sign that God commanded His Messenger ﷺ to write the Qur’an in the newspapers and what the newspapers similar to the shoulders of the wills, the kaqir and the slander, and that the revelation is the one who is in the name His Excellency said: He did not stop them, as we have revealed to you the book to be completed by them [Al -Ankabut: 51] for the sake of this meaning.And the transgression of the act of “reciting” to the “messenger” is a well -known mosque, which is equal to the truth.It was written, but the Messenger of God ﷺ was recited by the Qur’an from the back of a heart and did not read it from the newspapers, so the meaning of the newspapers is recited in what is in the authority of the Qur’an A phenomenon, and it is a detection of his ﷺ illiterate.The newspapers were described as (purified), which is a description of the metaphorical purity, that is: the fact that its suffering is not dressed in it, and it does not swear on what is in it, and this is in it, The people of the book will be made from the prohibition and the arrows.The newspapers were described Which the Messenger of God recites ﷺ; Because there are books in it, and the books are: collection of a book, and it is an act of name in the sense of the boundary; So the meaning of the books is in the newspapers that the newspapers in which the Qur’an is written in the Qur’an, and it includes what is included Creative from the prohibition and falsehood.This is as he said: Check out what is between his hands [Al -Baqarah: 97] and he said: This is in the first newspapers [Al -Ala: 18] The newspapers of Abraham and Moses [Al -Ala: 19], so the Qur’an is the Zuba Its fruits, so he called the books of the books the name of books on the face of the reward.What is meant by the books is the parts of the Qur’an or its illumination, with the reward of books.And the validity: the straight, that is: the intensity of the resurrection, which is here, is metaphor in the mind and righteousness; This is one of his suspicions to the sensual, which is similar to the standing of the standing of the beneficial work, and the opposite of the wag And he did not make a valuable waging for him [the cave: 1] (p-478), meaning: he did not make it a shortage of falsehood and sin, for the validity is exaggerated in the existing, like the one who is the one who is the same.The description of the description of the advertisement of his being and a description of a group.
