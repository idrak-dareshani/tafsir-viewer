The Quranic researcher is the angels and the soul in it with the permission of their Lord from every peace is until the abundance of immorality.If this second Bayan supplies what is in his saying: What do you realize the night of destiny [Al -Qadr: 2] from the foolish dignity, he obtained from it what indicates a sign of evidence that God has made it.Each night of the nights of the worlds falls in the same night as the month of the coming of the Qur’an is a dignity for the Qur’an, and for those who have been revealed to him, and for the one who is in it, and for the one who is in the It follows; Do you not see that the greatest of the surah was the remembrance of the night of the night of destiny, so it is only for the urbanization of the righteous deed in it.For her, it is better than a thousand months that are bound to that and his clear news has been shown.And expressing the act that is harmed by its saying: the angels are revealed by the authorization that this descent is developed in the future after this.And the remembrance of its end to the prolonged dawn has no effect in the Bayan, its grace, so it is aware that it is a integration of the definition of its mother to be keen on the people.There is no crime that the night of the destiny in which the Quran has come to go away, before it was passed before, one of the most Muhammad was the same as Muhammad.The Qur’an was the last, and he turned to its people in its morning; Without the will to be wanted by the virtue of the attisors in all (P-462) years, it would be rejected by the best of that first night.And when it was a need to download the angels in it, nor to the appointment of its adherence.This is a teaching of Muslims to glorify the days of their religion and the days of the blessings of God be upon them, and it is similar to what God has granted to the soul Who agreed for days in which a great blessing of God is obtained from Moses, he said: And he reminded them of the days of God [Ibrahim: 5], so we will be prepared for the night of Qadr.And the rule of hiding its awareness is the will to repeat the Muslims with their good deeds in many many ways Friday.This is what the Qur’an has reported in the best night of the night of every year, and it was not clear that it is any night, nor from any month, and the Almighty said: the month of Ramadan is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the Qur’an: 185] It turns out that the night of the first destiny is from the month of the month of Ramadan, not a place; We are asking for the help of the night of the first destiny that begins the Qur’an in which we can ask for the help of what it represents from my life in Ramadan in all the years, and the sins of the Sunnah, Similar.The similarity is in different characteristics, so it is not permissible to similar to it in the name of its day in the context of the Tuesday or the rolls, nor in the chapter of the winter or the sacrifice of the The one who is considered in religion, so we have to We ask for one side of the similar buds for the debt of religion and what may God be pleased with.He has been disagreed with the appointment of a lot of similarity; It is correct for what is used in that that it is from my night a month of Ramadan from every year, and that it is from my loser, as the authentic hadith is indicated by the authentic.Ramadan.” Al -Watr: The best of the numbers is with God as it is indicated by the hadith of it, “God is a ritual that loves Al -Water.” And that it is not a clear night in all years, but it is transmitted in the years, and that it is in Ramadan.And to this, Malik, Al -Shafi’i, Ahmad, and the most familiar with the people of science; Ibn Rashid said: It is the most correct of the sacrifice, the first of which is correct.And that it is transmitted in the years, so the people of science are more than that it does not come out of the month of Ramadan.And the gathering is that it does not come out of the twenty -shame from it, and a group said: Do not come out of the ten and ten times.(P-463) And they interpreted the relics of the effects of the dominant will or a general will with his eyes.And there is nothing in her appointment that is narrated from the Prophet ﷺ; Because what was mentioned in that news is an innervoyant because he wanted him to help her in the year of the Sunnah, which was informed of it, and that is a bastard in the books of the Sunnah Ibn is many of him with a lot.The Sheikh Muhi al -Din ibn al -Arabi was memorized that it was a certainty of its awareness of the disagreement of the years with the parents mentioned in the last house of it, the saying of it: A group that brings you after the half of the night, and we kept it from some of our teachers, and I did not stand on it.The mark of the sun tasted us in her morning, and she did not go back.And the origin of the descending, the deletion of one of the two times.And it appears that the angels are revealed to the ground.And we go to the angels to the ground for the sake of the blessings that they are filled.And (the spirit): it is Gabriel, that is: Jabriel is revealed in the angels.And it is meaning that their Lord is the permission of God, that the Muslims are honored by the Muslims that they were revealed to them in that night.Gabriel in that night to return to it from the preference, like the one who won its first similar similarity, the night of its descent in the lion in the cave of Hara.And in this origin to establish the accompanying people of the memory of the days of the glory of Islam and its grace, and that whoever has a work in the origin of that male, he does not know that he does not leave it By remembering it.And his saying: With the permission of their Lord, it is attached to the descent either in the sense of the captain, that is: they are revealed by the reason In the sense of accompanying, that is: associated with what their Lord ears them, for the meaning of the meaning of the export of the source of the export is to the verb.(P-464) and (from) in his saying From every matter, it is permissible to be a bayyan that shows the permission from his saying: with the permission of their Lord, that is: with the permission of their Lord, who is in every matter.It is permissible to be in the sense of B, that is: you will be descended from something like what is in the words of the Almighty: they keep it from the command of God [Al -Raad: 11]: meaning: the command of God; This is if B (with the ear of their Lord) is made because of a captive, and it is permissible to be for the analogy, that is: for every matter, God wanted to spend it.And (every) is used in the sense of many of the negligence, that is: in many great things, such as his saying, “And if they came to every verse [Yunus: 97] And on every guarantor [Hajj: 27] and saying it: and put all the Lebanon from them [Al -Anfal: 12].The naps said: “It is all the same and the majesty of my pillings ∗∗∗ to every man from the sand, and it was replied, and we have been among us when he said: And you call (an order) to the glorification, that is, with the types of reward on the work in that night.This matter is not the matter that is in the words of the Almighty: in which every wise matter is separated [smoke: 4] with that “an order from us” in the surah of smoke is unaware with the disagreement of it; It has replica.It is permissible to be the reminded thing here, so it will be absolute and in the verse of smoke a restriction.And he knows that the signed of his saying: the angels and the spirit are revealed in it to its saying: from every matter, from the sentence of the night of the destiny is better than a thousand months of the month: 3] Al -Bayani, or the fall of the insults, to take into account this satellite, the sentence was separated from it before it, and it was not overlooked with it with the fact that they are not.From them it benefits a two -year -old bias, and what I realize is the night of destiny [Al -Qadr: 2], so the observance of its satellite or al -Badili was observed on the observance I don’t know what is the night of the destiny [Al -Qadr: 2] because this Bian does not miss the Samaid when it is mentioned in the image The angels are revealed in it from the conditions of their goodness.A peace sentence is until the dawn is broken by the two guarantees of "every matter", which is (P-465) as a bell; Because the angels will be revealed, it will be for good and be for the evil of the butts of the lies of the messengers.They see the angels, not a day for the criminals [Al -Furqan: 22].And they gathered between their removal for good and evil in his saying: As your Lord suggests to the angels that I am with you, so I have proven those who believe, ask me about the hearts On the authority of the Eagle [Al -Anfal: 12] the verse, so tell here that the angels will be revealed to the night of the destiny to implement the matter of good for the Muslims who are fasting And they rose to the night of destiny, so this is a sign.And peace: a source or the name of a source with peace, said: We said, O fire, be a cold and peace on Ibrahim [Al -Anbiya: 69].Peace be called greeting and praise, and peace be upon him; And the meanings are caught in this verse, so peace includes every good; Because the good is safe from evil and from harm, peace is forgiven, the reward is removed, and the supplication is replaced by the best of the world and the other.And peace in the sense of greeting and the good saying is intended by the praise of the angels on the people of the night of the fate as their hearts with the people of paradise when he said: They enter them from every chapter, peace be upon you, with what you have been patient, so we are blessed with the homes of the house [Al -Raad: 23].And the denying (peace) of the greatest.And he was told about the night that it is peace of the lame; Because he is a news telling.And the bond of the chain of transmission, which is peace of the chain of transmission, is to benefit the seamility, that is: it is nothing but peace.And the palace is a claim to the integrity of the one who is more than the one who is in which the existing fasting people, and then it is permissible to be “peace is“ intended for the news of the news.It is permissible for the source to be intended and appreciated: peace be upon him, so the source is a substitute for the verb, and it is amended from his position to raising to benefit the one who has said: They said peace.Salam said [Hood: 69].And the meaning: Make it peace between you, that is, no conflict or a rhetoric.And what is in the authentic hadith is referred to to him, “I came out to tell you the night of destiny, so the men of the man were raised, and it may be good for you, so it is good for you, so it is good for you.And the fifth." And (until the length of the dawn) is an end to what he accepted from his saying: the angels are revealed to peace.(P-466) It is intended from the end that all of these nights are perfect with the descent of angels and peace, for the absence here is certain for the nights Because the night may be called some parts, as in the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “Whoever rises the night of destiny with faith and affiliated with his forgiveness, whoever comes from his sin, Said bin Al -Masib said: Whoever witnessed dinner from the night of destiny, he has taken a moment from it.He wants its witness in a group as it is required by the act of a witness.He came with a rhythm (even) for the absence of the absence of the night that the night of the destiny extends after the length of the immoral It is deluded that its end is the fungi of the other in the last part of the night; This is a broadness of God in the night's extension until after the dawn.It is beneficial to the end of the angels in it, that the end of the night and an end to the righteous works in it, the followers of it, to be better than a thousand months.And the public read [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
