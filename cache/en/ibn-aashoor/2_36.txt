The Quranic researcher, the devoted to them, is what they were in which they were in what they were in, and we said, some of you, for some enemy It is close to the benefit of the obstacle, so the punishment will be a nose, because the fall of the shadows was after a period of time, which is the same as the one who is the same Few.And the good is the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the exclusivity of the obstacle.And the shadows: Paying others, that is, doing it, as it is like a shower, that the man will run on the ground with the choice of the severity of the land of the land, and it is a luminous.Water, which is a famous metaphor in the breasts of sin and the harmful mistake, and from the name of the disobedience and the like.And the guarantee in his saying (about it) may return to the tree because it is close to it and to show the causes of the costume and the reason for the elderly from the paradise, if it is not the same The story was left about the remembrance of the causes of al -Kharj.And (on the basis of the origin of its meaning, that is, they are removed from the tree, i.E.From the most of them, and the addition of the added is that it is said that it is said (and this is a closeness) (35) (35) For the captivity, and whoever mentioned the captain, he wanted to obtain the meaning as Abu Ubaidah said in his saying of the highest (On the authority of it), and that the neighbor and the bodies are a row of a minor source, that is, the length of the passion.It is permissible for the collar of the garden to be fornia and it is (on) on its appearances and the shadows is metaphor in the lattice of his murmur, and it is intended from the heaven of paradise, as it is the same So it will be taken as his saying: How much is a house for me.And his saying (so he brought them out of what they were) in which there is a separation from the shadows based on the fact that the guerrilla of the tree (P-434), which is intended from the communication, is the same as the one who said: It was what was, if you made the guerrilla in his saying about it, which is domesticated to paradise, this separation was the separation of the detail of the summary, and the fulfillment of the loyalty was to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the slave Its exalted and how many villages of our people came to her, so we have come with us or they said [Al -A'raf: 4] and his saying was lied before the people of Noah, so they said: And the exaggeration of [the moon: 9].He read Hamza, “I removed them” with a thousand after the abandonment, which is from the removal in the sense of the dimension, and on this reader, he is aware of being a guarantee to (from it).He alerted him with his own characteristics with the knowledge that those who came out of paradise have come out of what was in which he was brought to this great loss in the greatness I have benefited it with special commitment, as it is a sign of hidden, so I was returning it in this prayer With his aim, as he returned with his words in his saying, he gave them a cheat from the day what they cheated [Taha: 78] and the verse is beneficial to the excitement of the sorrow in the soul of the soul It is the same as his compliance with the commandment of God, the Exalted and a preaching that is alerted to the path of the elders with the matter and the forbidden and the desire in the endeavor to what is returned to this to this And the raising of the enmity between them and between the Satan and its soldiers, as it was a reason in the course of this calamity for their father until they are never a revenge for their father.And his whispers are misfortunes who think that he is the one who said to him, O Lord, the sons of Adam, the Satan does not give you as it is as long as you are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from Some of you are an enemy, and this is a great origin in the general education of the public, and for it, the leaders of the nations were mentioned to them the sake of the enemies That is a matter of taking revenge.And he complied (and we said they are tied) with the waw without fulfillment because it is not a separation from the lame, but rather it is advanced to it, but the remembrance of this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The Satan and its vanity in Dame, so he said his saying (so he brought them out).Adam and Hawiya require that their relatives be found in paradise, so their frustration was a frustration of their lords, and it was said: The speech for them and the elasis, and if it is the same, and if it is As he said, his saying is up to the wall of Al -Araf (he said that I was better than him, you created me from fire and created him from clay [Al -A'raf: 12] Al-Saghrin [Al-A'raf: 13] to his saying, he said, "P-435), a mortal, is a jaws (Al-A'raf: 18)) In it, there is a pilgrimage to the entry of paradise on him and the first frustration was a frustration that is forbidden from dignity with his place of entry from the entry of the whim The guerrilla is intended for the purpose of the rituals of the ethnicities by showing and giving it from its saying (and each of them is a rhetoric) and the Arabs are sacked by that, he said: To me, they will say that you will not be killed and exaggerated, but he has two companions for his saying, "The Calf of your Prophet, etc." And some of you say to some of an enemy that is required to want some some kinds, which is the hostility of mankind and heaven, if the guerrilla is in the way, they are tied, The enmity of some individuals will want the types of human beings, if it is a guarantee, they are fastened to Adam and Hawiya, so that is a flag of them with the effect of the effects of their work, and for you The beginning of the appearance of the effects of the selection in formation They created them that their disobedience was inherited in themselves and the same as their offspring, calling for the temptation and trick to the limit [Al -Taghbin: 14] The ethical is inherited and how is it, which is what is prepared with the many perseverance and accompanying, and the father of Tamam said: ؎ ؎ ’enemies with the dream that the blame is the one who does not This effect and between its origin, which is the most from the tree, that the most from the tree was contrary to the command of God, the Almighty, and the rejection of it, and the misunderstanding of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And the urgency of the milk of benefit to themselves, and it is the immortality in paradise and the excitement of its goodness with the misunderstanding of the one who has the best of them from it and for it to be from it.They breathed them for the saying of Absis for them, as we have forbidden you from this tree, except that you are owners or you are among the creators [Al -A'raf: 20], so it was so.With what they were on the side, the humanity, and the union, it has been rejected by that alphabet and union for the sake of the benefit of the use of the soul, and it was not the same.Between that thought that sent them on the most tree and between his impact, which remained in their souls, and who will inherit them, they will be inherited, and they will be made.Their minds of creation with that creation, which has been dominated by the mind (P-436) their father, and no doubt that that creation is the one who is bound by the ritual of the soul and the goodness of the soul The hostilities are all because the one does not return the other except for a mockery of mobilization in a benefit or a misfortune that he believed in a harmful.In this, a sign of an ethical question, which is that the origin of the ethical is good and its ugly is the good and the evil, then the rhetoric will turn if it arises, then it will be done, then it will His friend resisted and did not do that residency, because of the conjunction of that thought, and for that, the project warned against the distress of the tick Well, and I commanded the maids of good, so the reward of the height was good with goodness, and if he did not work it, and the work was that of the same as the same as the one who is the same in the same way They are good, and he did not work for her, and God has a complete goodness, then he said and whoever was badly, then he did it, he wrote to him a single one of the sins.From God Almighty and forgiven in the hadith, “God will be perpetuated from my nation while I spoke to Him.” God Almighty created the human being, which is good from the evil and the evils on a royal attribute, and it is the meaning of our human being in the best of the good Phases, the first of which is the brightness of the lever, and put the names of the heavens, because that is a principle The knowledge and with it will be the learning, that is, some of his individuals teach some of what he taught and ignorant of the other, so the language of the language was the principle For good and appointed to him, because he has taught people some of them, and for that you see the boy seeing something, and he will accelerate to his villages, and he calls them to him.They benefited them, so the human being was aware of the fullness, and that was appointed to his goodness, but he is also good for the recovery of the penetration in the sympathy and the liar; Then, God Almighty, when he forbade him from an order that he wrapped in what is in his obedience to be excluded and to violate it, so that the obedience is the beginning of the movement of the soul in the same way God Almighty created that of that obituary, the principle of a new look, which is referred to by his saying, and then we repel it as a lower way [the fig: 5] and then this is the same.By following it, it is attained to the paths of the angels and returns to its first strengthening, and that is the meaning of its saying, except those who believe and do the righteous [poets: 227] The last one says when he comes, then he comes to me from me, so whoever follows my guidance [Al -Baqarah: 38] the verse.And the sentence of some of you is either an either one of the nursery, or a state of guarantee, or a state From the waw immediately (P-437) is a dispute between the imams of the Arabian, that prevented that mutation and the adulterers, and the son of Malik and a group.And the right to me that the current sentence seeks me with the guarantee of the waw and the wow on the authority So I took advantage of the waw, as the verse is the verse and the one: a further hand came to his head or his father accompanying him, otherwise the waw is obligatory, as there is no way to come to me And the sun is divorced, and the saying of evil: His guilt returned to what was returned to him as a shit (lick) on all of them.And when the time is time to lend to the human and Satanic type by lending the world, and it is necessary that what is meant is from the guarantee of (for you) to be lost, that is: Standardized and enjoyed.Rather, it was a enjoyment because life is a desired matter for the good people of humanity that life is not devoid of self and enlightening what God has given us from the millions.This is if I want the total news, that is, for all of you, and if I want to be lost, then the people are the time of the death of every individual at the same time One of you is a horse.
