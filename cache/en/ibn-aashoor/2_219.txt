The Quranic researcher will ask you about the wine and the facilitator.The ignorance, and they are the drink of wine and the facilitator, and this is one of the provisions that he has shown in this surah, which refers to the uniforms of the conditions that the people were in the ignorance of the people, from the ignorance of the people.His Excellency, O O you who believe, have been written on you in the killing [Al -Baqarah: 178] until the last of the Surah, except for that of the etiquette, the etiquette, the goodness, the prestige, the prestige, the prestige, the prestige, the prestige, the preachers, the good, And the stories; On the usual Qur’an in the mastery of its methods, in order to struggle for the addressees, the Samaids, the readers, and those who have been informed, and they have been harmonious in this verse.And those who are the Muslims; Al -Wahidi said: I came down in Omar ibn al -Khattab and Muazah ibn Jabal and the alienation of the supporters came.Diaspora of Malmus; So this verse was revealed, he said in the scouts: When this verse came down, the wine was left, and it was left with it, and then it was then descended after it Rather, the wine and the easy [Al -Ma’idah: 90] the verse.And the drinking of the wine is an authentic work in the east, which is not forbidden by a project of the bodies, not the destiny, but it is without it, and what is reminded of some of the scholars of the knowledge of Islam: A forbidden in all of them is a word that is not witnessed to him, but the groans against it is a widen The legislative colleges, which are the memorization of religion, the soul, the mind, the lineage, the money and the offer, which are what the parties agreed upon, and this saying, and if we are the one who is helpful When all of them have looked at the memorization of his things in its legislations, and as for it, it is observed with a milestone in other than the project of Islam, so there is no more Its rituals are a degree, and there is no need for searching in this, in order that the books of the book of the book are not in which the wine is forbidden, nor is it impartial from its drink, and in the teeth that is the one who is the one who is the same The wine was even drunk, and that a lump drunk the wine until it was sugar sugar, which led themselves to their claim to a heinous matter, and the last of the lies; Because the prophecy is obligatory, and the partnership is obligatory, and it is disturbed in the perpetrator of things, so you will not be transmitted to the prophets, which leads to the shortage It must be met: the drink of wine is not brought by the prophets; Because it does not drink it only for the arrogance, the fun and the sugar, and all of that is what the prophets can be displaced, and they do not drink it to the intent of the piety of the heart of this.And in the travel of the waves of the Tawarah: God spoke to Harun, saying: Wine and sugar, no You and your sons drink with you at your entry into the client of the meeting, so that you will not die.Forever imposition in your fee.To distinguish between the sanctuary and the analyst and between the unclean and the purified.And the drinking of the drink of wine in the ignorance is known to those who taught their literature and their sheikhs, so the wine was the strength of their life, and the shortest of their soul Their departments, Tarfa said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Zabd and on the authority of Anas Bin Malik: The wine was forbidden, and it was not a day for the Arabs to live more than it, and what was forbidden to them is more severe than them.So it is not a crime that Islam came in its prohibition with the way of the treasure, so he approved a period of permissibility of its drink and your reckoning in this person who is in that in the saying of the one who said: You take a good sugar from it [the bees: 67] on the interpretation of those who interpret the sugar with wine, and the sugar was said: It is the prophet, other than the sugar, and the first.And the wine of the beekeeper was descended with the Mecca, and the people of the effect agreed on the fact that the deprivation of the wine was located in the city after the invasion of the parties in the days, that is, in the past, that is Fifth on disagreement in the year of the conquest of parties.(P-340) And the first correctness, so God has given people to the people that they took a sugar from the fruits that he created for them, then God did not care about it.In their interests, they came to them in this way, so it was said: The verse of the cow is the first of this is the first verse that ears in the wine of the cause It is presented, so it will be and described it in the iniquity and the benefit that it is alerted to them, as they were not remembered except for its merits, so it will be a dedication to them to what he said, from what he will come to.When this verse has come down, the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “God is presented in the prohibition of wine” meaning that he began to prepare for it to be forbidden in it, and that is what you have said.The interpretation of Ibn Katheer: It is a gift to the prohibition of wine on bits, and it was not exposed, but rather exposed to any exposure to stop it.And the interpreters were gathered on that this verse: it came down before the verse of Surah al -Nasiyah and before the verse of Surah al -Maradah, and this is my opinion of Omar ibn al -Khatt It was also narrated from Ibn Abbas that he saw that the verse of the master was copied, O you who believe, do not approach the prayer and you are my wicked [women: 43] And the facilitator, and it was attributed to Ibn Omar, Al -Shaabi, Mujahid, Qatada, and Al -Raba’i ibn Anas and Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Islam.Some of the interpreters went to the fact that the verse of the cow has proven that the wine is forbidden, so this is this The verse has a descending after the verse of the Wall of the Walls, O you who believe, do not bring the prayer and you are a driver [Women: 43], and when the cow of the cow was the one who has come.The Supplier of the Land, so he comes to the saying that this verse came down after we descended from the cow wall and that it was placed here, attached to it.And that the meaning of them is a great sin in their use by the drink of one of them and the game of the other is a great sin, and this is the appearance of the verse; As the sin was described in it with great description, the verse of Surah al -Aqud will only be confirmed by the prohibition and a text on it; Because what is in our verse is one of the remembrances of the benefits that may be interpreted by those who are proud of the excuse from its drink, and it was narrated in some of the effects that people are drinking.This verse is a man, so they made a slander that is not seen, and it was drinking it as a man from the Muslims, so he made it to be killed by the one who is the one The Prophet ﷺ he came to him and raised something that was (P-341) in his hand to strike him, and the man said: I have been affected by God from the anger of God and the Messenger of God: It is prohibited by the verse of the Surah Al -Mudaydah.And the wine: a name that is derived from the source of the wine of the wine, from the door of victory if it will be seen.Because the mind is forced from the behavior of creation, a metaphorical name, and it is either a name for the source, or it is a name that came to the adultery of the source: it is the name The juice of grapes, or juice other than it, or water, in which it is in which it is a customer, or a dates, or other than the ostrich, and leaves until it is sealed, and the owner of it.The truth is that the wine is every drink, but it has overcome the juice of the drunk grapes; Because they were competing in it, and that others are called a wine, a wine, and a sheikh, and it was repaid, authentic news that indicates that the greatest of the Lord of the Arab Fifth of dates, and that the dignity of the people of the city is five days other than the juice of grapes, and it is from the dates, the zabbi, the honey, the atom, the ritual, and the bishop, Skilk, and to make.And what was mentioned in some of the effects of Ibn Umar: the deprivation of wine and the city is five drinks in which the drink of grapes is not, meaning that there is no one in the fifth It is not intended that the drink of grapes is not found in the city.The drink of grapes was to be glorified to the Hijaz and was found from the right, the sect, and the Levant, Amr ibn Kalthoum said: “And the oaks of the Andrina and the people remain from the country.He was based on the dispute in the name of the wine in the words of the Arabs, a dispute in the rulings.And few of it at the greatest of the scholars, and the youth of the many are limited to it when the crowd, and in the few, there is no difference, as it will come in the Supplied Suraid The gathering: Every drink is more sustained by its few, and its ruling is like the wine of the wine in everything.The prohibition is the dignity, and it is fixed for all of it, and this is the right thing.Except the sugar destiny, so the defendants are transmitted from Abu Hanifa, and the scholars in the Qadim were transferred by that, so that they may be released until the illusion that we do not.The wine is something, and that is more important that the permission is in it as a law that does not restrict the peace and may be supported by that with the words of Qasas and Qadil: المرية The ancient of the prophet and his drinking ∗∗∗ said that the warehousing and the sugar, but the stability of the Hanafis is that the drink is the drunkenness of the one who is the one who is the same, Four: the wine, which is the signs of the juice of grapes, if it boils and is tired and slandered with the butter Until it became a sugar, and the sugar with the opening of the sine and the sufficient, which is the one from the water of the wet, that is, from the hot water that is pasted on the wet, then it becomes a sugar, and the savage, which is the wicked, is from This is the fourth, a few, and many, and the impurity of the eye, but the wine is atoned for its decay, and the mustache of the few and the many are unaware of it, and the three of the three are not.Its mustache unless it is drunk.The second division: the halal drink is its drink, which is the prophet of dates and zipper if it is cooked and if it is the lowest cooking, and the prophets of the two of them are from them if it is cook And the barley and the offspring are not cooked.And the third is what was cooked from the water of grapes until its thirds went and the remaining third of it, so this is the four of its drinks; If God and pilots are not intended, but to strengthen the worship such or such or the rutting of food or the circulation, otherwise it is forbidden and its mustache is unless it is imprisoned.This detail is the evidence of the measurement, because this is the drink in which the accustomed molds remain, and the limit is not directed to the separation in it, because it is if it is on the authority of the whole.Ikkar, that it is necessary not to be the limit except when the sugar is obtained, and there is nothing in the effects of what is witnessed for that It is reported to the extent of the boundary before the seeded.Hanafi holds this Differentiation is that the discipline is drinking the companions is a touch of or before it, as the companions are avoided by drinking the drunkenness, but they drink the ritual, the premature of the ritual It is called the solution and the deceased, so the memorial became uncompromising, and the empty of Muhammad ibn al -Husan, his imam in that, was agreed upon.(P-343) And perhaps some of them mentioned in the recipient that the wine is a right in the drink of the offensive grapes, it is metaphorical, other than the discipline and the drinking drink, and it came to the veil, So he can be carried on his right, and to attach others to him to prove the language with the measurement, and this is invalid, because the dispute is in the universe of the wine in the drink of the disagreement in the disagreement of the Language and release, so the severity of the view of it is how the diligent thinks that God is exalted deprives the lights of grapes and leaves it in the way The influenced in the rulings, if they said: The adjective that was mentioned in the Qur’an has been in it in all of them in all the drink, and that is to prohibit the destiny of the sugar, and the silence of the ruler of the rulings It was proven by the Sunnah as the fierceness of the few and the limit on it or on the sugar, so that is the place of the view, we said: This is a source of being, because we are not.It is separated in the rulings between the similar things in the adjectives, that it has been established in the authenticity of a confirmation that does not call for a doubt in the spontaneity in the way that the prophet ﷺ said: “He said:“ He said: “ And the dates, the bow, the barley, and the atom.David, and said, "Every wine is a wine and a deprivation of a deprivation." Ibn Omar narrated it in the Sunnah Our drink is the dates.As in the Sunnah of Termahi.As for the widening in the wine after the cooking, it is distorted for its horizon and staining, and what is the cooking if the Ikkar is not existing.And God has described the wine by having a great and beneficial sin.And the sin: the disobedience of God by doing what is in it is a corruption and does not satisfy God, and the rich indicated that in the derivation of the ingredient the meaning of the fruits of the good, and the son of the Arab said: Explanation of the defamation mentioned in the verb, as if it indicates that the sin against the reward, and the appearance of the terminology of the law that the sin is the act of the one who is in the shadow.So the meaning of them is a great sin that they cause them to be a sin in the case of Arabism and the state of profit and loss of quarrels.And the launch of the great on the ingredient is a metaphor, because it is not from the bodies, so what is meant by the great: the hardening in its type as it is presented as a nose.He came in the indication of The kindness is to benefit the intensity of the ingredient and the benefit of them; Because the curtain (P-344) is the most severe kind of attachment, and it is a wide metaphorical custody in the words of the Arabs, and the custody was made, attached to the same What is meant in their accommodation is used.And the release of the expression by siring the significance that it returns to my drinking with the punishment in the world and the hereafter.And the vocabulary read a great sin with a murmur after the cave and read it Hamza and al -Kisayi (many) with the third of the tribe, which is a metaphor of receptivity and the description of the righteousness For the power of the entity in the abundance of numbers.And the benefits: a collection of goods, and it is a name on the weight of a verb and its origin is to be a minimum of a mechanical source of which the power of the benefit is from it, because it is the power of the The building of the building.It is possible to be a name indicative of a lot of what is in them, such as their saying: the seven and grave, meaning that they are more than the benefit of the one who said: And spoiling, so the benefit in every case is the most of the benefit.And the sin that in the wine arises from what is arranged on its drink, as a result of excessive excessiveness in it and the Arabism from the quarrels that go to the hatred and the replacement of the path of God and the prayer of God And exposure to ridicule, and in it the money is going in its drink, and in spending on regret until they may have mortgaged their clothes at the time of the khimarin, the son of the son of Al -Walid said Al -Makhzoumi: We are in the drink of Amr, if they are ravaged ∗∗∗ Al -Nadami’s clothes with them like the Maghanim ؎ ours Antarra: If I sugar, then I am a millions of money, and my feet are not spoken, and they were bought by the wine with a precious one, and they are not in the same time, and they said: The lord of the Lord is the most heated, or the color of it, and it was a shame, and the sins of it, and the sins of what the medicine, who are delayed, decided that it is the one who is inherited by the one who is inherited from the two who are inherited from the two who are inherited The two lungs and the heart are weak in the wretched, and Islam has been discarded from all the parties by prohibiting it, and for the sake of its harms in the tranquility, it is forbidden in it.The ignorance, so those who forbade it on its own in the ignorance of Qais ibn Samer al -Maktari because he was drinking a day until he was drunk, so he was attracted to the son The moon was speaking, and when it was told about that when it is true, it does not taste the wine, and he said: (P-345) ؎ I saw the wine righteous and in it ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ I drink it correctly ∗∗∗ and I never heal with a bishop ؎ I am not given a thirty with my life ∗∗∗ and I never pray for it.Amal Al -Qali, the first two bit.Umayyad, and among them is Amir ibn al -Zarab al -Adwani, and among them is Afif bin Maadi, the Lord of the Kenadi Bin Uday Al -Ta’i, and the blessing of Islam and Asad Bin Karz al -Qasri al -Bajili, who was dubbed in the ignorance of the Lord of Bajila, and Utman ibn Affan, Abbas ibn Merdas, Uthman ibn Muzamun, the illiterate Bin Abi al -Salat, and Abd al -Allah ibn Judaan.As for the benefits, it is a minimum benefits, and it is what it is gained from the power of the debt of the weak in some of the conditions and what is in it from the benefits of the merchants.Features of pleasure and pilgrims.It is worn with water, and it is gone and some of our scholars went to the fact that the benefits are millions, so only a crime from the confessions with a minimum of the mud of the wine, which is the wilderness Some of them claimed that in the wine, it is a minimum, but it is permissible.And he was mentioned in this easy verse as a compassion for wine and an informative of them with uniformity.Its drink is said like it in the facilitator, and that the facilitator is the verse of the wine in the ability of the souls of the Arab The drink, if the flesh is bidding them for the whims of the drink of wine, then they will send them to the sacrifice of islands.People with the sacrifice, as in the story of Hamza, as we walked out of the authority of Ali ibn Abi Taleb, when he was Hamza with a drink, so he sang it.O Hamz for the drink of the splash ∗∗∗ and they are reasonable with the knowledge, so he stood up to it, and he fell into its stomachs, and he brought the background, so he divided it in a famous story.A camel from his father’s camel in the event of his sugar: ؎ I have a shameful humor ∗∗∗ a sheikh’s mind like a weld With the best of ؎, he said, “What did you see with a drink?Their words of their century are drinking, and Sibrah ibn Amr al -Fakhsi said that the camels remember: ؎ We love it with our competence and forbid it ∗∗∗ and we will drink in the richness of it.Then he mentioned the facilitator in his comment and said: The lords of all the most heard of ∗∗∗ or the Joanah who was slaughtered and its conclusion was then said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ To be adhered to it with a climbed climb, its bodies and reminded them of a single house and he said He recalls the two centuries, which he had granted in the war: a rugged one that will give it to praise if you are the ends of the merchants, for this is the time of this is the verse of this.With the remembrance of the facilitator, and for the sake of it, we have settled in the question of those who are asking them if there is a question.And the facilitator: the name of an anchor on the weight of an act that is derived from the facilitator.It is against the hardship and the intensity, or from the house and it is against the insolvency, as if they were forced into this decoration, taking into account the adultery of the name of the place of the one who is easy, and it is a place that is a place With the dignity of the custody in which the right or the ease, because it leads to the honor of living and the removal of the difficulty of the time of the place and the dogs of the winter, and the owner of the scout said: And in it, if he was a source, he would have been a cinema; As the source who overwhelms the act of the act is only the opponent of the eye, but it was not the same, and they did not remember the facilitator in the abnormal, unless it is answered that the Arabs are placed.The abnormal source to know that it is now not a source.And the facilitator: a gum that was for the Arabs in the ignorance, and it is one of the oldest and the righteous in the old Bin Aad and (P-347) is said to the enemies of the naked, and the most promising is that he was the son of Aad bin Aws ibn Iram bin Sam, and he is not the same as the wise of the wise, and the Arab With the easy, they said in the proverb: I am pleased with Laqman and they claimed that he had eighty women who did not separate him from the masters of us and their honor, and for that, then they would like it.The supervision of the people is in the capacity of Laqman.And the description of the facilitator that they were making the twelve of the collection of praise by breaking the bush, which is the arrow that is the smallest of the nobility and from the arrow, so it is the same بِها الصِّبْيانُ ولَيْسَ في رَأْسِهِ سِنانٌ وكانُوا يُسَمُّونَها الحِظاءُ جَمْعُ حُظْوَةٍ وهي السَّهْمُ الصَّغِيرُ وكُلُّها مِن قَصَبِ النَّبْعِ, وهَذِهِ القِداحُ هي: الفَذُّ, والتَّوْأمُ, والرَّقِيبُ, The solution, the competitors, the captain, the high, the softening, the praise, and the boom, and the window, which is the fourth and the fifth, is said to be fifth.Its installation, and the last three are not lucky, and they are called the gathered of the guarantor of the guarantee of the guarantee and the curse of the fulfillment, which was forgiven from the mark, and this is the signs As the rusty of the Romanian account to the four, and they have made signs on the signs of signs in the census or by burning with the fire, so the mark is called, and the mark is called, It is placed in the navies of Al -Qaddah.If they wanted to resist, they bought a wild Due to the fact that it was removed and divided it with any parts to the twelve and ten parts, or to ten parts of the parts of the one who is among the people, and the father of the father, and the father of the This is two ways, so the assets and Abu Ubayda are different, then they put that praise in a seedlings of a skin called the ribs with the bridge of the ribs, it is like the ribs, and it is like the rituals, and it is like the rituals, and it is like the rib.A narrow outfit that narrows from it or three or three of it, and entrust this rabies a man who claims to be inclined, and the harmful, and the one who is the one, With a cloud, and they make a white, light, they are called the pilgrim, they disobey it on his hands or a stigmatized skin, and they are called the swallows, This incitement is filled with a garment that brings his head out of it, and then he will kneel on his knees (P-348), and he places the ribs between his hands, and he will be left behind The agent is the security of the incitement and on the right, so that no one will be associated with anyone, and he is the one who commands the incitement to give the facilitator, they are sitting, and the sins are on the authority Rukbah, Derid Bin Al -Saham said: I was paid to the course and they were closed to the passengers.That is, its movement, and it will be subjected to it in the ribs, so that it is mixed, then it will be imposed, that is, it pushes it to the side of the outfit of the ribs, and one of the one is one of the one who is one of the one who is one of the one who is one of the one who is one of the one who is one of the one who is one of the ribs of the name Praise, and the agent is presented, so he takes it and looks at him, so if he is one of the hearts, he pushed him to his owner and said to him, “He will be disgraced, so he will be upset, and he will be upset, and he will be up.” Gallavah, and they were unhappy if the first of the gravity comes out, not to be calculated in a fine or in a sheep, but rather returns to the ribs, and the referral is repeated, and so, and whoever comes out to them.The thickness of the islands.As for the description that described Al -Asma’i that the islands are divided into eight and twelve parts, and it shows that all the people of the dignity of the dignity of the ritual of the ritual The collection of what is on the eight signs, and the ten days, and on the people of Qaddah, the thickness of it.As for the description of Abu Ubaidah that the islands are divided into ten days, then it is required that not all the opponents are with the righteous, for the sake of the Lord, for the sake of the Lord, for the sake Ten arrows from what was shed by the rest, and then if the parts are exhausted, the opponents were cut off, and the people of the arrows are sung.Arrows with fortunes after those who have gone through the wonders of the islands, as it is not in the facilitator more than one butter.And if there is no sheep in the facilitator, except from the meat, not from the condemnation or otherwise, and perhaps each of my descriptions And Abu Ubayda was a way for the Arabs in the facilitator according to what is overlooked by the people of the facilitator, and if the adequate number is not gathered from the one who is the one who has taken the time Three, and he has a lot of his profit or his sunset, but he does this people of generosity and beds because he is a great loss of loss It takes more than the arrow of the stable.The hands are as the jungle said, because he intends to repeat the known one at the profit, so my hands are in the sense of blessings, and they were given the reward of the sophistication, the wise and the wise As for the reward of the signer, it is given it from the first of the division and the best of the flesh and the beginning of it, as for the incitement, it is given a flesh without that.The division is a bone or half a bone, and they call it the deem.And whoever brings the facilitator from others, who calls the elderly, the group of a bouncing is a shoulder, and they are preparing in the waters, and who does not love it, and he does not love For his poverty, he called Al -Baharm by investigating.The origin of the intended is the intention is the intention of all of it, and it is the profit and the fun, which indicates that it praises them and gives them the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake This giving is mentioned to all those who play the facilitator, when he praised him, he said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ and the one who is the one who praises the lord of the people.They appear to be raised from the lifetime in the money of the perpetrators, so they make the profit to the poor and the orphans and those who fill them in their sins from their contents, and he said: Call them for a barren or a spoiler ∗∗∗ I was humiliated by the whole of her welding ؎ Falf and the neighbor of the junction as if they were overwhelmed by a shyness of them, so they are in the same way The slogan of the people of generosity as it was presented in the verses of the good, and he said, as it was presented: lying to praise it if you come to the ends of the merchants, the ends For a lot of what is in the winter, to benefit the poor, and Amir ibn al -Ja`dah said: ؎ is easy if the winter and the restricted ∗∗∗ for the meat is not the same In two, the two niches are known as the well -known and the verbal as a dry grace.The benefits in the facilitator are in particular and general, and they are all worldly, and the sin in which it is what is signed by enmity, hatred, and from the loss of time, and the bond, and the bond, the bond, the bond, the bond, the bond, the bond, the bond, the bond, the bond, the one who is the one The remembrance of God, the prayer, and the impotence in the religion, and the commercialism, and the like in what the civilization of the civilization, and that are sins that have its harmful effects in the hereafter, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the harm in the hereafter.The jurisprudence of the facilitator is every play in which there are rituals, such as apostasy, And on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ “I will be the two kaabi, for they are the facilitator of the creek.Malik and Abu Hanifa said, Al -Shafi’i said: If the Shattinj is removed from the bet and the tongue from the tyrant and the prayer of the forgetfulness, it is not a forbidden while it is outside the one who is uncomfortable Paying the money and taking it, and this is not like that, and it is its face, and the question is affiliated with jurisprudence.People are intended for the general to disagree with the benefits, and because when the news was signed by the authority of “the graphic benefactor, it was not in the words that it is necessary that every one who is unique With wine and the easy, but the words require that the benefit of the benefits are equipped in the wine and the easy one for those who want to be intended as the saying of the exalted: Let people not be a sect of the soul of the “” here for the covenant, and if I want a sect, it is not true that it is said: and the beneficiaries of the Sharbis, and the one who said: There is a pleasure for the mustache [Muhammad: 15] If you say: What is the direction in the remembrance of the benefits of wine and the facilitator with the fact that the context of the prohibition and the guidance to it is necessary for it, if it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is The verse is a descending to prohibit wine and the facilitator, as the one in the remembrance of the benefits is the Bayan of the Provisional Provisional Provisional, so that the Muslims are used to taking into account the paths of things, because this is the one who is the same Always and bid him a nation that wanted to be legislators of the different and the narrators of the journeys.To eat his brother's flesh dead [Al -Hujurat: 12] and the like, and the prescription is devoted to the hearts with some rulings in some verses, but it is in the places of the hide It was created between them, and the facilitator has taken it as an offspring to benefit the poor, so it is obligatory for what the correspondence is with the news of the ruling, The descendants of the costs of their weaning from their greatest deeds are reminded of them that their Lord only wants their goodness without their nicknames, as well The fighting is a hatred for you [Al -Baqarah: 216] and his saying was written on you, as it was written on those before you [Al -Baqarah: 183].There is also an extensive one, and it is their virginity of what is preceded by them so that they do not be forced to this prohibition and redemption on the corrupt as the one who knows the knowledge of God.He himself and forgive you and forgive you [Al -Baqarah: 187].* * * (P-351) and they ask you what they spend.Say the forgiveness, as well as God shows you the verses, so that you may think about the world and the hereafter.With their question: What do they spend?And the facilitator, and that is the circumstances of the sidelines who prefer in the different verses in a phrase (they ask you) with a kind of kindness, so he came to this.And the appropriateness of the installation is that the forbidden from the wine and the facilitator is signed from it, disrupting great spending, which the holes are intended, so the ritual, so that it is clear to them.Ibn Abi Hatim that the questioner about this is Mu’az ibn Jabal and al -Ulabah ibn Ghumnah, and it was said that he is a return to the answer to the question of Amr ibn al -Jamuh, who was said to him The Almighty asks you what they spend, say what you have spent for the good of the religion [Al -Baqarah: 215] etc.It suits it.To show what is pushed, they will affect the use of the holes, and this verse was prayed before it with the waves of kindness.And pardon: a source of pardon, if he increases and grows, he said, and then we changed the place where the good is the good until they pardon He agreed and agreed with his
