Because when they were committed, they deleted the action of the condition for its redemption in the hand of (but), as they disliked the connection of the fulfillment of the answer to the condition of the condition, so separate them from them.Speech, his saying (P-130) said whoever has his book with his right, his origin is the chest of the sentence of the answer, and he begins his news, so he says, “I will read it as he will come.” And his saying indicated that he who has given his book with his right to his right to the words of his ability to be briefly: every one of his books is brought in, so whoever writes...Etc.On the way of his words, he will be shed with the sacrifice of the sea, and he closed [Al -Shuaraa: 63].And what is in his saying (with his right) for the accompanying or in the sense (in).And the coming of the book in the proximity is a mark on the fact that it is a dignity and a missionary, and the Arabs remember the deepening of the proximity as a result of the insignificance of the one who is the one who said: It was raised to a glorious groan by a two -year -old, and he said, and the companions of the right are what the companions of the right are [the incident: 27] in the Sidar Makhdid [Al -Waqi’ah: 28] the verse.Then he said, and the people of the north said: What are the companions of the north [the incident: 41] in the poison and Hamm [the incident: 42] the verse.And a sentence, and he says, “Hawa, read his writers as a condition (either), and he is sinning about the news of the beginning, and this saying is a saying of a glow and a dooer who is a good man.His book is a penalty in the place of confusion and pottery, so it is a seduction of his ink and dowry, because the Kinary meaning is the greatest extent of the remembrance of the offer.And (Ha'a) is a compound from (E) Without J.And if it is more desirable than one of the one who is more than one time, it will come to the verge of a speech, such as the flag that attached the guarantor of the address It was attached to the mark of the dress and the collection, and it is said: Hawa, as it is said: I am, and the mother is as it is said: You and the people as it is said: I am, and from the family of the language: Behold, they are installed from two words (her) and the act of the group of The verb (mother) if he is intended, then reduced for the large number It is narrated by the satisfaction in the explanation of the adequate and Ibn Makram in the tongue of the Arabs.(P-131) and (Ha'a) in his way, an adept, the name of the verb in the sense: Take, as in the scouts and in the sense of glorification, also as in the end.And the speech is in his saying, Hawa, read to the righteous from the people of the mud.And (his writers) originally: my book is to make you talk to the one who spoke to one of the faces in the J.That ya for the dignity, preserves the movement of the intended ya.And (read) Bayan for the one who is intended from the name of the verb from his saying (Ha'a).Each of (Ha'm) and (read) may be removed from his saying (his writers).And the appreciation: Haya, his writers, read his writers and distraction in his writers and their regulations for the time when the time.This distraction has the right to be proven in standing and falls into the connection.It was proven in this verse in two cases when the readers were brought up and written in the Qur’an, so he knew that it was for the expressions of the words of the one who said that He aims to seek Arabic; Because it is possible that the one who says this distraction comes to stand on both sentences.Because these words were brought up, and the communities are like a backfire, they are considered to be the same as the standing of the Qawafi.Two volatiles were fell, and that is a scandal in two beneficiaries.And he read it to Jacob, if he arrives in the delicacy of the distraction, and the readers love that the reader stands upon her to agree The suspicion was given in his saying that I thought that I was in his account, in the sense of the juice, which is one of its meanings.And on the authority of Al -Dahhak: Every belief in the Qur’an is from the believer, so it is a tender and from the infidel, it is a doubt.And the truth of the suspicion: knowledge that was not achieved; Either because the one who is known to him did not fall after and did not come out to the world of sense, or because the knowledge of his owner is a disadvantage in a way.With this, the release of the miserable information is a true launch.And on this, Al -Azhari was running in discipline, and Abu Amr, and he was confined to this meaning, Ibn Attiyah.(P-132) The words of the scouts indicate that the origin of the suspicion is: knowledge is not timeless, but it may run the course of science;

Because the beauty of the view is one of the pleasures of the soul and the blessings.And he fell in the poetry of Zuhair: As if my eyes are in my west of killing ∗∗∗ from the clarification, he wore a paradise in a crushing, so the people of the language said: It is permissible for you to be.With an estimation, as they said: a camel is a disorder and a woman who is disturbed.And they did not come to the meaning of the crushing in it, which is the reaction; Because the raised is far away, and they said: The palm tree was crushed as a generosity if She took.And in the Qur’an as a paradise with a rabbit [Al -Baqarah: 265].They also wanted to be intended for the highest, like that of so -and -so, with a ravine degree, and with that the word (high) was here, there is no one to say it.[Al -Baqarah: 265] Because what is meant is a paradise of the world.And Al -Qutouf: The collection of Qutfa by breaking the barefish and having the lean, which is the fruit, was called by that;
