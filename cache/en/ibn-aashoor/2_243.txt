The Quranic researcher sees to those who came out of their path and they are thousands who warned the death, so God said to them, then they will live.They fought in the path of God and know that God is a good knowledge of a premature manner to be broken on jihad, and to remember that the caution is not delayed, and that the caution is not delayed, The misfortune of the survivor, and it was presented: that this surah was descended in the period of the resonance of the Hadibiyyah, and that it is a gift to the opening of Mecca, so the fighting is from the most important of this Speech is his saying and fought in the path of God.The words are a return to its saying, the fighting has been written for you, and it is a hatred for you [Al -Baqarah: 216] and the words of the two verses were separated through the verses that are the one who asks for you.And the fall of you did not see to those who came out of their life before his saying and fought in the path of God, the satellite of the male of the evidence before the scalpel, and this is the one who is the one.The evidence is presented before the one who is inferred to the two points, as a saying to me, may God be pleased with him, in some of his speech when he reached the authority of the sham of the son The sermon conquered and said: It is nothing but the kofa, the most dominant and its simplicity.These people are the pledges of you (P-476) by their meeting with their falsehood, and your separation from your right, so he said, “It is only the kofa” signed by the sign “Do I think of these people”, etc., and Issa ibn Talah said when he entered the Arab ibn Al -Zubayr, when his leg was cut off: what we did not.The one who has kept you more: He will be heard for us, your eyes, your tongue, and your mind, and one of your legs, so he said: We did not return to the struggle Performing and care for the argument, before the remembrance of the preacher, or a pregnancy on miraculousness with compliance.And I know that you will be installed (did you not see so) if the action of the vision comes in it, which is transgressing to what is not from the stomach of the Samaid that he saw it, it was the words The action of the vision, and this is what is agreed upon by those who are immoral, and that is the concern of the captain, who is used in the same way A metaphor or a Kinary, one of the suffering of the right, and the rhetoric of it was a dominant, directed to a certain one, and the addressee was a voicing.We have in the face of this use of this urbanization from that installation, the faces of three: the first face: that the interrogation is used in the admiration, or the admiration of the Addressing the verb of the action of the vision, and the action of the vision is a science from the sisters of thought, on the gold of the mutation, which is right; Because “to” and the blame of the neighbor are punished in the words many, and it is the saying of the Almighty and the matter to you [ants: 33], meaning you and they said: “Ahmad, God, to you“ as it is said, “God and God” The first effective, because the purposeful of the excessive neighbor does not ask for a stuck, and a sentence while they are woven in the position of the situation, picker the lion of the second verb: because the original is the original.Because the actions of the hearts are that it is a situation, on the estimation: what was of their right to the exit, and separated from his saying, and they are the most words of his saying, and God said to them, so they will die, so they will die, so they will die.The second or is made to a murder to develop the action of the vision of the meaning of knowledge, or two centuries to it, or to include the verb of the vision, the meaning of this The matter is the one who is aware of the mind, as if it is in the look, to be between it (P-477), the sincerity of those who know it, so it will be their saying.Two years: Didn't you know such and look at him.The second direction: that the confessional is a tradition, for it is the most coming of the arbitrary.You know that God is able to be able [Al -Baqarah: 106].And the saying in the act of vision and in the transgression of a letter "to" the counterpart of the saying in it in the first direction.The third direction: to make the confesser to be a deny, a denial of the knowledge of the knowledge of the one who is the verb of the act of vision and vision in the knowledge of the word The saying is in it on the first direction, or that the vision will be a visionary, as the verb is the meaning of the meaning that he looks at him that he will address the one who is overwhelmed by the one who is overlooked The questioning will be ancient: a right or a download, then the ride is transferred to its recovery in other than the insightful things, and it became like the example, and the proverb, and the proximity of it.He runs out above his face and benefits the urbanization, on the three faces, but it is one of the ways of the kanna with the necessity of the meaning of the understanding, because the matter of the matter is from the matter.It is approved by it, or the one who has its knowledge, is that it is that the reasons for his knowledge are available, and that is what is incited by his knowledge.He knew that this compulsion was running the parable of the example, in his mandate for this question, so that they changed it by disturbing the tools of the discourse, which is comprehensive, and from it: And against him, we have “did not see” in the speech of the woman and “did not see” and “did you see” and “did you not see”, in the trinity and the collection if this is in this way of this It is to be a vision for the addressee or a divorce.He was disagreed with what is intended from these people who came out of their path, and it appears that they were people who were immortalized by their enemies, so they left their paths, and they are left.It is said by the Almighty: They are woven It is a state of a state and it is the place of arrogance, but the number of numbers is a place for surprise if the intended is the fear of the enemy, then if there is a lot of people.They leave their visions of fear (P-478), and the Arabs say to the army if he reaches the elders, and it is not negligent.It was said that they are among the children of Israel, who were immortalized by a prophet for them in his call for them to the stress, so they separated their homeland with a struggle, and this appearance, so you will be the same The cheese in the fighting, in the case of those who came out of their current, with the mosque of the forehead, and the case similar to it was appeared in the adjective of the cheese and the most likely, the same in the case of In the case of those who offer a man and delay the other, it is not said that that will return to the similarity of the thing with the same.This is the most likely to be the faces, because the most likes of the Qur’an are to be in the fields of the famous nations and a personality of the children of Israel.It was said that they are among the people of the children They swollen, and their bodies were then revived.It was said that they are among the people of the rituals, in the Levant's flaws.And all the novels agreed that God revived them with the call of the Prophet, Hazaki, Bin Boys They are granted from the plague, with the fear of the fear of the death, and the likes are imitated that they are a people from the Muslims who are the elderly of the forehead, when they were called to jihad in the jihad.A chapter is an outlet and its fall before it falls, to cut the paintings that might be dangerous in their hearts.And in the interpretation of Ibn Katheer, on the authority of Ibn Jarraj on the authority of Ata: that this is an example, not a story of satellite, and this is a distance that is excluded from the expression of them, and the one who says: God.The warning of the death was cautious about the verb for its sake, and its treatment came out.The appearance is that they are a people who flew from their enemy, with their many, and they were given the diet, so they fell to them in their way, the sacrifices of them, they are the same.Foreign and diseases, their symptoms were similar to the symptoms of death, like the disease of the silence, then they were acquitted of it: in the event of them, such as the saying of the ritual: P-479) The love of the ritual ∗∗∗ a flesh of death and in the death is a slope and support that it is a sign to a height and is not the same as his saying that God is a good one of the people of the people About them, they are not among the children of his saying, after this, after this, you did not see the fullness of the children The dead [Women: 78] will realize it and say, “If you were in your homes, you will be a prominent of those who were written on them to the murder.” [Al -Imran: 154].As for those who said that they are people from the children of Israel God protects them with the call of Hazaki, and those who said, but this is an example, not a story and a satellite, so the phenomenon is that they wanted the vision that was mentioned in the book of Haza.The spirit of the Lord was broken and descended in the midst of a seat full of bones, and I passed through it from its around.Know, and he said to me to predict these bones and say to her, O Japanese bones.It is above and there is no spirit in it, so he said to me to predict the spirit and say, the Lord said, O spirit, from the fourth windy wind, and he endowed on these killing, so I would have gone away, so I would have gone out, and he will be sought.They greeted and resurrected their feet very great.This is the example of the predicament of the fulfillment of his people, and their Islam for their enemies, because he said after him, “These bones are all the homes Our bones, and our hope is that we have interrupted us, so he said, and say to them, the Lord, the Lord, said that if you open your graves and ascend you from them, my people, and come to you to the land of you So you will be.The people are among the people of Dawardan: because Dawardan was with the flaws of the Khabour, who saw the Prophet, who has seen what he saw.It is in it either a metaphor in formation and death is a truth, that is, he made the state of death, and it is the hearts of the heart, the dumping of the perception and the basis, the condition of the affiliation of the person who is affected By receiving the commander to the matter, so he released the likeness that is compounded by the case, which is likely to be like the way to the way of the analogy, and then they will be blessed.They were afflicted with what is as long as it was a domesticated death, and this may be from the analogous drugs (P-480) the silence, or if the saying is metaphor With the death, and the death is a right, that is, I will be blessed by God.The prophets, and the death is a metaphor, which is a matter of reference to them, and he threw them with humiliation and children, then revived them, and you have proven in the spirit of courage.The Muslims by the lactation of the cheese, and that the fear of death does not pay the death, so the people of those who were struck by this example are removed from the path of their dignity.Their fear of them is a thing, and God has died and then revived them, so that the creation of the courage will become a sense of the courage.From the story: that they tasted the death that they have flew from, to know that the righteous does not enrich anything from them, and that they tasted the life after the death, so that they know that the death is that the death is that the death is that Come on, say, the fools will not benefit you if you repeat the death or killing [Al -Ahzab: 16].And the sentence is that God is a preference for people and a satellite of the soil of the sentence, then the most important of them, and the intended of it is the creation of the enemy in God in the peace of God.All of their affairs, and that if they thank God for the blessings he gave them, he increased them from his grace, and facilitated what is difficult for them.And a sentence and fought in the way of God the verse is the first one They came out of their paths with kindness, so that there will be a ruling for a sneak The fighting has been written for you, and it is a hatred for you [Al -Baqarah: 216], for our saying: It is given to it that the connection of the two gardens is attached to it with a kindness.And a sentence and know that God is a knowledgeable person who urges the fighting, and warns of his left, by reminding them of the surrounding of the knowledge of God, with the Almighty.He was presented and listened to hearing, and he is more special than a knowledge, and he was eaten here; Because the greatest of the fighting in the path of God is one of the listening matters, such as the jilbah of the gyrce, and the skeleton of the weapon, and the treasures of the horses.Then he mentioned a knowledge of knowledge because it is the knowledge of all the information, and in it what is from the hadith of the soul is like the creation of fear, and the loyalty of the soul is from the soul, and in this way of the soul, and in this way, and in this way of the soul, and in this way, and in the soul of With promise and return.(P-481) And open the sentence with his saying and know to alert it to what it contains in the sense of sweep and exposed to it And know that you are met [Al -Baqarah: 223].
