The Quranic researcher (P-302) are the same as the example of a fire that followed the consequences of their attributes with the opposite of its group in one image, with the case of their condition, This is a way that is similar to the representative, in order to have the reasonable conditions with sensual things, because the soul is to the trauma.And as a perfect for the penetration of a group of separators in the hearing, the vocalist in the memorizers, in one form, because the justice after detailing has a scent of the whims.And the collection is reported by what was presented in the same way that contradicts what was depicted as a predecessor, because the image is renewed at the soul that loves it from its consequences.He said in the scouts: The Arabs were stoned, and the most likely scholars and the organizers are not hidden in the stools of the suffering of the suffering and the lifting of the wanders from the truths The imagined in the image of the investigator and the one who is delusional in the exhibit of the perpetrator and the absent like the viewer.And cursing what is included in the group of these attributes from the bad situation, the disappointment of the pursuit and the corruption of the punishment, so it is the supplies of the suspicion, the purpose of the intensity.And approach to what is in their conditions in religion from contradiction and contradiction between a beautiful appearance and a rugged interior with a huge condition of the world, for it is from the abundance of the analogy The analogy, and the angry of its temptations with the same in the likeness of it.He said in the scouts: And for the matter of God, the highest in his book is shown in his words, and he has fought in the words of his Messenger ﷺ and the words of the Prophet and the rulers, he said, and these are the most likes.It is reasonable except the scientists [the spider: 43] uh.And the representation is a generous bodies of the rhetoric, which does not reach its merits, other than their own.It is here from the similarity, not from the borrowing, because it is the remembrance of the likeness and the likeness to it and the tool The top of their likeness is like the same as the one who has lost a fire from the past sentences, the fall of the Bayan, the report, and the frustration, so it was between it and between it and what happened to you It was separated and did not turn, and the state that has been seized by its representation will come with the last interpretation of the verse.The origin of the ideals is with two conquests is the counterpart and the like, and it is also said: the same by breaking the mim and the cousin of the ritual (P-303) and it is said that it is said as it is said, and the like, and alum, And a way, and there is no power for these words in the coming of actual, act and effective in one sense.The proverb was sealed with two “conquest” by release in the case of the strange situation; Because it is represented by people, clarifying, and likening the likeness of it as it is here, or did you not like it as it is in the saying of the exalted, the same as the paradise: 35] He is issued in a strange state, and he preserves and rumors among people for rhetoric and creativity in it, so people still remember the situation in which he was said to be from that, and that is the saying of that A wondrous condition that was spoken and forgotten because it was not issued in it from the saying of a way that makes it a reminder of his remembrance, so he is called for example, for example, for example.They were informed and they were dedicated to administering, and they define it that it is a similar saying that is harmed by its murder, and I will remember it as a relative.It is clear that the launch of the likeness of the brief, brief saying between the people who say it in a wondrous case is a launch of the release of the name of the name They can hardly strike an example, and do not see it as a people to facilitate and be very traded except a saying in which there is a rhetoric and privacy in the eloquence of the word, and the sake of it.The example is a dear saying that is not in the acquaintance of the general sayings, but it is one of the sayings of the rhetoric, so this is described as the westernity, that is, the pride is the same as the one who said: Cow, and their saying: It is not obeyed for a short time, and you will know that.And when it was common, the proverb was noticed by the functioning of the wondrous situation.The multiplicity of the likeness of the likeness and the likeness of it with the side of the like, and in the side of the likeness, and enter the sufficient and bend it from the analogy of the likeness of it They call that, so they do not say like that like the like of the lion, and they likened to a criminal case in the case of a compound, as a compound, as they are in the case Except except for his sufficiency to the water to reach his mouth [Thunder: 14], but they remember the proverb in the two sides, most of the verse is here, and perhaps it is mentioned (P-30).One of the two sides is like his saying, but the same life is like a mantle that we descended from the sky [Yunus: 24] the verse, and that is to be replaced by the way that the one is the same There is no case in the same way, so the proverb became the same as the form of the form of the origin of his place The proverb is preserved, so the kaf is in the words of the Almighty (as an example) indicating the suspicion, and I am not increased as it was the one who is satisfied with the evil of the pilgrim, When his saying is up to the highest or as a sinner [Al -Baqarah: 19] and with the origin of the place and abandoning the recovery, you do not see how I seek to return to the word It is said to be the highest or a sinner [Al -Baqarah: 19] and he did not seek refrain from the Kaf.In order to release the proverb, the scholars of the Bayan were brought up in the name of the likeness in the name A biophageous form of multiple, unlike a group, with the relationship of the similar, in an act of representative Those On the guidance of their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 5], and I followed their words, and I found the analogy likeness, and it is attributed to what the analogy is almost, so the one who comes in the first thing is in the first place: It is stated in the tool of similarity, or it was deleted from it on the way of the likeness, as in this verse, and the saying of those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the same We are the first of those who were bought as we came.The second was not on the expense of the representative, the explicit that they remember the memorial of the custodian of the form that is similar to it and the one who is omitted, and the one who is omit We are the one who is the most famous, and it is their saying: I see you presenting a man and the last one.The third: an analogy is an analogy, and it is similar to a form of bodies, and the indicative memory is not mentioned to the form that is similar to it, but rather it is not covered by it I was preparing an example of this type, especially the well -known ideals of this title, Najo: She was said at the conditions, famous and walked until its remembrance became a foretold of those conditions that were said at her, and if the word is not mentioned, and the extension of the state is not mentioned.It will come.Then an example did not bring me to the representative of the chapter, so that the day of the day was attended by the day of the day.Dirt has taught people with their saying: Oh God, there is no lived except the livelihood of the hereafter, and forgive the supporters and the immigrants, so I said that those who are in this case are in the case of this.They only wanted to release the body of the mother of those who were the ones who were digging the beach with the prophet ﷺ when they were repeating this as well as this.In order to be from this theorizing that their hole is that of its youth in the puff of the beach in the conquest of the parties with the glory of the acceptance of the acceptance of God, the Almighty is not.With him, but they have been toured and symbolized to him with what he is for his boundaries that he knew about, and he is the saying of the prophet, that article, and then I was bound by the saying Say to those who have been infected with a little by the way, so that it is a matter of the status of the status, for he deleted the likeness of it - which is the state of the exposure to the He looked at him and prevented him from the one who passes it - and he came with something from the balance of this situation, and he is the saying of the walking of the person to exposure: he is free from the way.It is a chain of transmission, such as the saying of Abi Ata Al -Sanandi: Your remembrance and the sin are dangerous between us ∗∗∗ and I have gone out of me, and the poisoned is the poison of the poison For the seams, it is similar to it in the case of what is caused by the blood of the bitterness after the last after the other.As if she does not tell her what she afflicted at first and then came to the face of the consequences, and from this division when the bound is based on (Ali) from the one who says: Their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 5] And the words were presented to him there.As for the example that is a similar saying that is harmful to its cord It is likened to the case in which the saying is evaluated, so the speaker in which the situation in which the saying was issued and the saying is similar to it, and it is similar to the situation that is the same In the case of the case that is similar to it, he was told to remind the thief to that situation, and that the condition of the day is young, and it makes the mark of the male of that saying in the case.And if you fulfill the contemplation and find this work before the standardization of the statutory, for the sake of the time of those that are called the name of the example, the name of the proverbs and the one who has passed and said: The abolition in these tachs was from the palace of cases similar to which there is no referral to their comparisons for them in the permission of the people, so it is (P-306) to be the one who is a well-known for it.Those who are the same, and those of these ideals were a symbol of the adoption of the cases in which they were said, and for the sake of that, it is forbidden On her graceful and preserved gossip, and their assistance in the bastard of the images of the journeys in which she was said, so it is not a symbol of the halls of it Its pioneers are not a case, and in this way of the request of the face in the Arabs of the Arabs from the change of ideals until they surrender from the life in the ruling between the owner of the owner of the owner As the owner of the scout made the reason for preventing ideals from changing the westernity in it, and he said: They did not strike an example, nor did they see a family of the chapter, nor a new one A stranger from some faces, and then he was preserved on him and protects him from changing, and his wounded hesitated in his intention of the western, and Al -Tayyibi said: The westernity is the opposite of the words To be according to the meaning, either to be according to the memorial, but the first is if it is seen on the effect of the contradiction and what is by the contradiction of the saying of the ruling: A threar of RAM.That is, the Lord of a prestige, a calamity, without Ram: that is, a disobedient, and his saying is up to you, and you are in the vast of life [Al -Baqarah: 179] as he made the killing a life.As for the second, that there is a strange, not used by the public.And the addition of a threar as a ram.Or in which there are problems with a grave: as it is condemned, it is condemned.He wanted as she did.And some of them were entertained by rhetoric and eloquence until it became Wonder, and when he did not want to be strange, it is only a special obedience, as the strange thing is the metaphor of the mouths and the western.As for the key to the key, he made it preventing it from changing its flowers on the way of the slogan, and he said: Then, the similarity is the same as the one who is very popular and famous for the sake The settlement has become called the ideal, not otherwise.And to his way of the money and the master.You have taught her secret and explained her while he was clear.The flowers of the ideals are on the way of the boss (P-307), not changed from its memorial, which was mentioned in the original, reminding, and other than them.The meaning of their saying in the definition of the example of this release: a saying that is likened to its mereness with its uniqueness that its meal is the case of the same The place of that is the one who puts it, that is, the heat of it, which is said: The example is the same as the likeness and the like.In it, which is the one who said that saying, that is, it was chest at her, she was called a mourned because it is in the house of the place where the water that the one who is said is said, and it is said: Which people are transmitted and redeemed in the cost of the doves and the country, as if it was running from country to country.And who was driven by a single fire that intended for one similar because it is one of the pursuit of the fire and the meaning of the community of a group of fires, and it is not the case The hypocrites, as if the body is likened to the form, but it is attached to the formation of the similar body to it, not to be on the authority The hypocrites in the appearance of the effect of faith and its light - with its hunger with the misguidance and its inception - is the same as those who are hoping for a fire.And he was criticized in the sense of the time, the Sun and the time in which it is for sure, as they are in his saying, the Almighty, so their Lord answered them [Al -Imran: 195] and their saying: Blancing from a fold in Hammasia.The nobility of the Nabel is in the absence and the text of the soul that was built on the generosity that he wanted and a fuel that falls at the thieves strongly.Likewise, in the verse for revenue, the state of the hypocrites in the purification of faith in the case of the employee of the fuel is the state of the critic.* * * And his saying: When I lit what about God went with their light, they were separated from the sake of being.And when: a letter indicates the fall of something at the end of it, so the fall of its answer is compared to the struggle of its condition, and that is the meaning of the saying: Any letter indicates the existence of the answer to the existence of its condition, that is, that its answer is like the reason for the existence of its condition, whether it was from the arrangement of the one who is the one who is the one The caused by the causes of the cause, whether it was the arrangement of the comparison with the comparison The essence, and the comparison with the way of the approval, all of which are seen and resurrection in the words of the Arabs and in the Qur’an.For example, the arrangement of the one arranged on the cause: “When his mixer has been exempted,“ and the reason for the reason (P-308), and when our messengers came, they are a bad thing with them.77] And Amr ibn Ma’adi said: “When I saw our women, they are fortified with the dear ones, I tightened their cookies, and I did not see from the removal of the cookie, and the liking of the The saying of the Qais: ؎ When we rewarded the lives of alive and began ∗∗∗ Bennna, I have been disappointed with a hall of the sacks of Qanqal ؎ Raya Al -Mukhalleh and the example of the comparison that has an agreement when our messengers came to the Bashri [Al -Ankabut: 31] They said peace [Hood: 69], and he said it, and when they entered it, he entered it.[69] Whoever thinks that “what” is authorized by the cause of their saying that they say: “It is good for the stomachs - a pregnancy for the mother in their phrase on the authority of the He finds the words of the imams.And “lighting” comes in transcendence, which is the origin, because it is his alienation: it will be, then it will be his gossip for the transgression, as the saying of the father of al -Tameh al -Qayni: The night is until the wilderness is kept, and he will come in a minor in the sense of the light, so his understanding of the world, that is, it became a light, and it is equal to the sake of the righteousness Al -Burq: It is clear, or the wounded of a monk ∗∗∗ The hopes of the sultanate with the wicked and the verse, and the verse leads them, that is, when the fire lit up the flaws, which is the one who is not.And it will be a flame, so it is what is around it, a verbal connection to lighting, which is the one who is the one.And it is necessary to be from the “lighting of the minor”, ​​that is, the fire was lighting, that is, it was raised and its light was many of itself, and it is what is around it on this, a kind of light About her is far from her.And around him is a difference for the close place, and it is not necessary for him to be intended to be surrounded, and he is transformed here in the sense of his religion, and whoever deludes that what is in it is necessary for it to do so.Separate only with a curse.And the collection of the guilt in his saying with their light with his being with the affliction of the opposite, in his saying, what is around him, taking into account the arrogant condition, which is the state of the one who is not the case The likeness of it; It is the state of the one who is standing on the face of (P-309) in the way of return to the original syntax, which is the impact of the light of faith from them, so it is a hand to the hypocrites, not to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a close The chest is the most likely you want the unique slogan, and it is one of the artists as the saying of Tafra: Performing promotion, and the close of the return from the way to the path of symptoms in his saying that comes, and God is surrounded by the infidels [Al -Baqarah: 19] and his goodness is that the one is the same The analogy and the remembrance of the likeness to it, so the spoken of the choice in the observance of both of them is because the description of them is that some of them are one of the one in the same way.The likeness of it is noticed as the ribs of the likeness.This requires that the sentence of God be gone with their lights (when), so the collection of guerrillas with their lights and left them is a delay in the words The phenomenon is to say that God will go with his light and leave it, and for that choice here, the light is made in terms of fire that begins with it, so that the alerts are upon him The truth is to indicate that God gave the light of faith from the hearts of the hypocrites, so this is a brief briefing as if it was said: When I lit God, the light of God is with the light of God Slaves, there is no covenant for the Arabs with the same, as it is one of the methods of miracle.And close to him, his saying, Rather, they said that we found our fathers on a nation and that we are on their effects Our fathers found us on a nation, and we are on their effects.You sent a story to the discourse of the messengers of the messengers in the answer to the question of Muhammad ﷺ His people with his saying, even if I came to you [Al -Zukhruf: 24] and this is what is in this بَعْدَها مِن قَوْلِهِ تَعالى يَجْعَلُونَ أصابِعَهم في آذانِهِمْ [البقرة: 19] إذْ يَتَعَيَّنُ رُجُوعُهُ لِبَعْضِ المُشَبَّهِ بِهِ دُونَ المُشَبَّهِ.The owner of the scout was permissible for him to be the saying of God with their lights, and it will be dedicated, and it has ended when he said: Answer to what is deleted, the arrogant sentence indicated, which is close to what I mentioned, but the advertisement is different.And the meaning of God gone with their lights: they turned their fire and crossed the light because it is the intended of the resilience, and he supported his fear of God, because he is the one who has been blessed, or for the sake of God.A fool, and the Arabs and people support the matter that did not clarify its reason for the name of God, as well as it is presented with his saying and extended them in their tyrants: [15] (P-310) The aggressor gave in the casualist who gave one of the grooves with the prodigy and its exaggeration in the transgression of the casualization of the origin of the place; Because the origin of it is that he went on to indicate that they are gone, and they are more severe, so it is more severe in achieving the going of the companion as his saying, and when they went to him [15] With his command or his sending, when he wanted to go to a person, when he is not a doubt, in which he takes care of the guardianship of that with himself until he is based on the same) Expanding the meaning of his people With him and the like, and if he did not accompany him in his going as his saying, he will come with the sun from the outskirt For the exaggeration of the transgression in the recovery, and they say: Gluts went with the fullness of so and so they do not want to go with it.But they kept not to use that except in the position of affirming the dhikr, and the exaggeration remained in it.And the convergence of the individual in its saying and what is around it, taking into account the likeness.And the choice of the memorization of the light in his saying, God went with their light without light and without fire because the light was not attributed to; Because the one that resembles the fire from the likeness is the viewer of Islam that they appear, and the expression of Islam has been raised by the light in the Qur’an, so the choice of the light is so good With a house that is reported to the rule, because it is attributed to the likeness of the likeness, and crossed by what it meets in the case of the likeness of it with a memorial that is correct for them, or it is in the case of it, or it is in the case The speaker as we presented the signal to him in the face of the gathering of the destiny in his saying with their light * * * and left them in darkness that they do not see this sentence To the guarantee of God, their light is because those who went to his light remained in an unforgettable injustice, and the intention of it is the increase in clarification The smile in the silence is not for the custody of the custody, for if God gave his light with their light, it is beneficial that they did not lose a fire, so they fled The endeavors, but the Samaid may not have what they have become for him when he had the case, so he would say after that and leave them in darkness that does not see it.They are not intended from the Bayan except the severity of the possibility of the suffering, and that is to be softened, likened to, and they are represented, and they described the knowledge, and they will come to the brother This is a bodies, as in the saying of Tarfah: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ 311), so if it is the one who says: More than the formation of the state of the duct and the improvement of its country.This sentence also benefits that they did not go back to the enlightenment from a distance, on what is in its saying (and left them) from the benefit of their hatred, and what is in the gathering ( The darkness, which is an increase, is increased by what is beneficial to the one who gave God with their lights and what is required by the collection of injustice from the estimation of three of the three of the three of three Their delusion as it will come.And with this reflection that is intended to report the sentences before it, it was sympathetic to the sentence, and it was not separated.And the right of the blessing is the difference of something that was compared to it in a position and its burden in that place.And many people remember the situation that leaves the active active on it, and in this settlement It is more permissible to be a sacred meaning or made.Al -Nabahah said: Do not leave me with the feet as if I ∗∗∗ to the people lengthened with it the bitumen, I will leave, that is, that you do not deliver me with this similar.And the saying of Antara: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ Its effect is as in the house of the nap, or from its contempt as in this verse.And the difference is between what is considered in it the meaning of the one that is the second man About him, the second teaching is a situation, even if the intention is first to that second, which is the place of the good, the second text is effective, and it is in the sense of the news, so it is not one of them.Meaning, even if he carries it.And the collection of injustice to the purpose of the intensity of the intensity of darkness, as the saying of the Almighty, say: Whoever delivers you from the darkness of righteousness and sea [cattle: 63] and the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “ The many when it was in the nose is the reason for the power, they release it to the divorce of power, even if it was not a number or a lot like a lot of words.He said to him, and call a lot of a lot To glorify, and the form of gathering from that tribe, it was said that he did not want in the Qur’an the remembrance of injustice unique, and perhaps the injustice of the most famous of the launch in the words When his saying is the Almighty and made darkness and light [cattle: 1] in Surah Al-Anam with the difference of his saying (P-312) in the darkness of three [Al-Zumar: 6], so the righteousness is the same.Three.But the rhetoric of the Qur’an and the words of the Messenger, peace be upon him, do not forgive the extraction of a group other than what is intended for it, which is increased, increased by the pronouncement, That the collection of darkness is referred to it to the conditions of the hypocrites, every case of which is reconciled because it is likened to the darkness, and that is: the state of disbelief, and the state With the believers, and what follows those conditions of hypocrisy.This is a representative of the state of the hypocrites in their frequency between the viewers of faith and the abode of infidels, so the face of the similarity is the appearance of a foolish thing, then the one is a good thing Including it, because in their appearances Islam with the believers is a picture of the good of faith and its screaming, because Islam has a light and a blessing, then they do not get it.Their devotion to them, and they will go away from them and return in the darkness of the infidels more than what they were on because they were in disbelief, and they became in disbelief and what is from the disbelief The blame is, the one who loses the fire in Darkness requires the vision of things, so if the fire is extinguished, it becomes more confused than it at the beginning of the matter, because the light of the fire has returned to his eyes, so he will be in the face of The second is the strongest and the disbelief is established in them.With this, the Bayan's joke appears with a sentence that they do not see to fly the state of those who sneaked his light after being broken by it.And the effect of (they do not see) is a deletion of the intention of the mortality of the insights, so the verb is revealed by the obligatory Basir to them, such as the saying of Al -Badari: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ On the fat of the Samae because it is subjected to the group of what was presented from the explanation of their condition, starting from his saying and from the people who says: The ideals are included from the sign to the similar faces between the parts of their conditions and the parts of the case like it.For their condolences for faith in their saying, we believe in God [Al -Baqarah: 8] and their saying, but we are reconciled [Al -Baqarah: 11] and their saying is for the sake A goodness that is on the hypocrites when they bring the jam of the Prophet ﷺ and when they appear in Islam, prayer, and charity with the Muslim ones The saying and the strength of the Silkok, and the wiping lights are divided upon them.When they are abusive from that zakat sitting and their cells to their grace from their arrogance or from their followers, so they will give them the most dhimm The disbelief, the deception of the believers, and the custody of them, and the mockery of them and their description of unfortunately.This is the same as the back, and that is the case in the case of the one who lost a fire and then went from its light.And from the advents of this representation that it is with the installation of the form that is similar to it and its compatriots for the compounding form of their condition, it is a metaphor for its absence, it is a subject of it.Each part of the form of their conditions is with a part of the form that is similar to it.People to good and right to fire to illuminate the ownership of the owners, and the likeness of their return to their disbelief in the gossip of the light of the fire, and the likeness of their disbelief in the shadows, Their vision.
