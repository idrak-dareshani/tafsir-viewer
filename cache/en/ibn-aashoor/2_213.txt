The Quranic researcher is one nation, so God sent the prophets, mosques and warnings, and the book brought them up with the right to judge among the people, so they will be governed by the people.Because it was a matter of disturbance of the religion, it was from the human being for a judgment that it required and that he benefited from that and God returned to people to the same religion in Islam.And the appropriateness between it and between what it provides, it impersonates its face The causes of disbelievers on their disbelief is their unification of the world in the hereafter, indicating in this verse that this situation is concluded with those who are among those who are unbelievers.Coalizing the critical of the critical (P-299) that people were one nation based on the truth and their disagreement was because of the prostitution and the righteousness in the request of the world.Histannia, nurturing a bayyan to theorizing what the Muslims met with what was in the ancient nations.The second: It is taken from the words of Al -Tayyibi when he said, the highest, or you calculated that you enter Paradise [Al -Baqarah: 214] He took from the words of the scouts that the intention was from the saying The Messenger, peace be upon him, encouraged the stability and patience on the harm of those involved in the remembrance of what was met by the nations, the righteous, and what they did.The appropriateness on this is in the meaning of its saying, the exalted, Zain, for those who disbelieved the worldly life and harnessed [Al -Baqarah: 212], etc.Performing the occasion.And it is clear that the satellite of this verse here is a gathering of the slope of a sacrifice for what he accepted and ahead of it after it: The first is the first The past is how the dispute arose between them in the truth from what is for the way that God will be condemned by the messengers The situation in which the Muhammad's resurrection was created and what the Messenger and Muslims met from the participants.As for the second, it is because it is an advanced because it is mentioned after the remembrance of Islam in the guidance of the right to the right in which the nations have disagreed, and he is the one who is the one who says: When they differed in it to his saying to a straight path, and that is from the characteristics of the place of Islam, which is concerned with the precedent of the divine and the one who is the one who has been preceded by the divine, and the preference of it.This is the great, the greatness is obligatory for it and not to be the effect of the envy of the Prophet and his nation, in response The envy of the people of the book, which preceded the alert, on it in his saying, is the Almighty).Right [Al -Baqarah: 142].And he obtained from the generalities of that, the Muslims have learned between the phases of religion between the peculiars of the people of the words of universalism that were sealed with the saying of God, so that they will not be.There is a right in it with his ear, if what is meant is one of them, one nation is one in goodness and truth, and it is the choice, as it comes, so the Prophet has come to God.Apart people who are separated from the intent of the people of the entry into one public debt, so the appropriateness is with a sentence, and they enter the peace of all [208] For the people of the book, that is, enter into the religion of Islam, which God has guided by the Muslims.(P-300) And if what is meant is one of the people of one nation: the one in the misguidance and disbelief, God has warned them that the mission of the messengers falls for the sake of the sake of the disbelief It occurs in the centuries of ignorance, so that the centuries have ended to the century, which was followed by the mission of Muhammad ﷺ, so the verse will be proven for the sake Coarines with his saying, Zain for those who disbelieved the worldly life [Al -Baqarah: 212].The meaning is that Islam is guided to a project that collects all of them as an evident for the subject of this religion and the fending of its people to what is not guided to it other than them, with what is not for them, with what is not.He is a gift to him and insulted him, as we will show him when he said: God who believed.People are the name of a collection that has no uniqueness, and “there is no refuge in it, and it is here for the public, that is, all of them, all of them, as it is not a good A well -informed general of the majority of the majority and the number of people who are in addition to the dilemma to appear that they do not leave the time in which it is good for it A evil is like the era of the prophecy, and they do not leave the time in which evil is overwhelmed by some people in which there is good, like Noah, and what is safe with it except for a few.And the nation is to be angry: a name for the group whose one is one, which is derived from the mother with the opening of the ham They agreed on the subject, religion, language, or in all of it.The description: One in the verse to confirm the individuals in its saying “a nation” to pay the delusion that the meant is from the nation’s nation, so he thinks that the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one One, because the nation may be called on those who are collected as a definite lineage.The one is here: it is intended by union and the same in religion with a separate village (so God sent the prophets), etc.The people were on one religion of the right and the jurisprudence, and in this sense, al -Tabiri narrated its interpretation of Abi Bin Kaab and Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, and Qatdah, Jabir, and Jabir Zaid, who is the choice of Zamakhshari, said the pride: It is the most frequent of the investigators.In it, because the expression of the news of the prophets on the precedent sentence, and the mission of the mission by saying it so that it is possible for you to do so that the people of the people are among the people, so they will be among the people.The briefing is that the people were one nation, so the messengers (P-301) came to them with desire, endeavor, promise, and return, so that they may be on the truth The difference began to appear, and God will be in the books to judge among the people, as they differed in it, so it is not a crime that the coming of the messengers will be for the sake The disagreement that needs the mission of the messengers is the consolidation that is after the agreement on the right as it is required by the separation on the sentence that the people of the nation were in a single nation So God sent the prophets and on the authority of his saying to judge among the people while they disagreed with it.For the sake of this village, it is certain that they are destroyed: then they were then said one nation, because the resurrection was raised on the one who is the same, not the one who is the same And on this understanding, the son of Masoud read: People were one nation, so they wrapped, and God sent, etc.On the soul of this universe with no estimation, and had it not been for the two villages to know about this, he was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one.They were able to speak, and they differed, and everyone who appreciated them was disbelievers, which were the mission of the messengers to them.This estimation supports its saying in the verse of Surah Yunus, and the people were only one nation, so they disagreed [Yunus: 19] that the phenomenon was the union of the abuse of the two, because it is the time On the authority of people that they were a single nation, and we see their disagreement with our knowledge that they did not sleep in that situation.What is meant by the verse on this direction is that the neutrality, the guidance, and the righteousness are the breakfast that the people have broken down, when they were created as they were created, as it was.With your Lord [Al -A'raf: 172], and that it is what you cheated, but you will not deliver the misguidance and irrigate the falsehood, and that God sent the prophets to pray the innocence of a partial, so they were the same, so they were the same, so they were the same.According to the disagreement of the interests, the people, and the severity of the complaints, it was from the facilitated prophets, and from them the rude and that it was a praise to entrust that of that The one is good and guidance, and that is the meaning of his saying, so God who believed in etc.And from the gift and goodness, that the meaning: the people were a single nation, and the one who is the one who is a one who is a single nation On the authority of Ibn Abbas, he also gave him his saying (And God sent the prophets) By virginity and warning.What is meant by the verse on this interpretation is that what God has sent with the prophets was in which he fell asleep and the disagreement, and when they were sent, and that they were sent to him To guide them to what they have disagreed in, so that the intended is the intention of the religion of Islam and its grace over the path of the religions with what was with him from the Bayan and the Bayan.Whatever what was meant is that it was action, “here it is used in the origin of its meaning, and it is the equity of its tree name, with its leaders, and it is in the past, and that it is the same, and that it has been.They divided into two categories on the right and a category on falsehood.If the unit is the right in the truth, then it was obtained in a time in which the majority in which the people are guided, the righteousness, the righteousness, the salvation, and the righteousness, so that they would not be in the way Their conditions were disappeared, and corruption appeared in them, and it was said that there was in between Adam and Noah, and this was transferred from Ibn Abbas, Qutdah and Mujahid, and he said: Noah's time, as the disbelief of his people disbelieves, and they destroyed the flood, except for those who saved God with Noah, so those whispers were the survivors of a single nation, and it was a one who was a one who is a person, and the right of the right, The truth when God created the signs that will be deposited in the children of Adam, and he breaks it on Islam, so they approved it with the bodies and the servants, which is what is in the saying Your Lord is one of the children of Adam from their appearances, their offspring and their testimony on themselves Or do you say that our fathers have been blessed before and we are offspring after them [Al -A'raf: 173] on one of the interpretations of that verse, and this is narrated from the father And Al -Rabi` ibn Solomon, and in the interpretation of the pride from the judge Abd al -Jabar and Abu Musalm al -Asifani that the meaning of the verse was a single nation in the name The creator and his attributes and the disorder of injustice and the falsehood and their pilgrimage are on that that his saying (the prophets) is a group that benefits the general, that is, because it is a matter All the prophets were after the people were one nation with the evidence of fulfillment, and the partnership is met from the prophets, so she is aware that the one of the people is a mother The propaganda of the prophets is only beneficial from the mind, and they mean that God has broken the human being at the beginning The human being is in the best of the evaluation [Teen: 4] and it was said: I want people Adam and Hawa.Ibn Attiyah transmitted it from Mujahid and a people, and whom we are obligated to do so that this was in a time of the time of the people and the existence of people on the ground that God knows, and God bless him Many [Al -Furqan: 38], and it appears that it is a time of Adam until the people of Noah have been blessed.With what was mentioned in the correctness that Noah was the first messenger to the people of the earth, so it appears that the misguidance (P-303) spoke in the people of the earth and their uncle is urgent, so God sent them to them.With the flood, Noah succeeded and sparked with it, so all the people became good, then they disappeared after that, and God sent the prophets.It is possible for us to look now, as this is the meaning of this verse in the meaning of the appearance of the parties and the reasons for that.People are one father and one mother, so they are not criminal that they were in their first matter a single nation because their two parents when the many sons and the children of their sons are among them A single family, created from a pure mood, and it had a similar mixture and created a single biography in the conditions of all of them, and it was not all of them.A few have no effect that he will need and does not speak in the family, contradicting or daging.Then, God Almighty when he created the type of human being, he wanted him to be the best of the meters in this land world We created the human being in the best evaluation [Al -Teen: 4].So the elderly created in the best of the evaluation, which is met by the male and the mind, and its inspiration is the knowledge of the good, its followers, and the knowledge of the evil, and it is lost.She turns as a result of what is in the benefit and guides to what he needs to give to him, and she is reasoned by what is indicated by him, so he will distinguish the benefit of him and the benefit of it, and the benefit of it, To him, his thoughts are a strong, strong, strong, and hated by the euphoria of the best in the best calendar, which sustains the female creation similar to the creation of Adam.Adam, the Almighty said that you created you from one soul and created from her her husband [Women: 1], so she was in the fee of her mind, her flaming, her mind, and the help of her body, on the authority Adam.There is no doubt that the strongest of the supporter in the evaluation of the human being at the creation is the righteous mind, so the mind comes to the human being to be in the face of it, and that it is in the face The need for it.This was the time of the male and the female.The researcher in the land was the intellectual and the conversion of the bad civilization.The righteous is the origin that was created by the human beings And he was overwhelmed with him, not in short, and then he took a time to the lower slopes, so that the human being increased to the bottom of the slopes, but it was presented to him in the absence The little of the ritual or its mourning, because the causes of the warning from the premium is not the four reasons: (P-304): the first: His mind or in his body, and he arises from the guidance of the guidance for that distraction.The second: The acquisition of shallowness from the ethical from the fools of the lust and the angry and the mourning of the mourning of others, and it is the one other than it, as well as the one other than it.The third: Fantasy malays that occur in the soul, contrary to what people have like lusts and extensions in the love of self or in the purchases of others from what is in the way Its owner is investigating it.The lord: the breasts of actions that are issued from the individual with needy or boundaries, and find it suitable for him or a pleasure with him, so he will be obligated to it, so it is necessary for it to be.And after it, after the length of the period, it will be the same, because the habit, if it is a naivety from the mind, is not a vision of the naughty, so it is a messenger.This is four reasons for the decline of the good break, and the first was the first to be in the beginning of the human being, because the peace of the forefront and the youth and the accustomed of the medicine and the simplicity Everyone was obstacles from the formation of the formation, not to see that the types of every animal corresponds to the state of his breakfast, so he does not go away from it.And the second was unaware, because human beings were one day and one in one citizen who walks on one system, one, and one, and a single sense of one, who is one, and whoever is one, who is one, who is one, who is The difference.The third is possible to exist, but the love that is from the goodness of the pensions and the thousand, and the luxury of the brotherhood, and the preaching of the righteous from the sake When this sensation is impure.And the one who was not the one who was more in the first time of the existence of human beings, because the needs were running on the basis of the original nature, and because the improvements were the same The causary is the possibly of the compassion of the tenderness and the decline in the conditions of the emergency human.As for the narration of the killing of the son of Adam, his brother is what is only a period that arose from the third reason for a sensation and my sentiment is the envy with the ignorance of the absence Because the humanity did not know the death, then it was not a day, and therefore the regret was wrestled with it, so it turns out that the ritual is the state of the nation, the day or the one who is the one.(P-305) It arises from this weapon and the righteousness in the fathers of the righteousness in the texts, because the wretched is a relaxed from the same origins.And when the relative was a genealogy From the remembrance and the female, the ruling on the print was based on a group of the two cases, then if the two cases were equal or approached, the human beings came to the conditions Noah, peace be upon him, said in his opposite, and they only give birth to disbelief [Noah: 27], and what indicates that the state of humanity is at the beginning Between Adam and Noah, ten horns on a project of the right.Then the human family abounded, and the tribe was formed, so it was multiplied and established with time with a few, a little, and the disagreement in the causes of the causes of the causes A follower of a difference between the states of the father and the mother, so the hippocampus came in terms of compounds, contrary to each of the individuals of the father and mother, and that is the mother of the mother Then the four reasons for the four degradation, and it became a mandate for the sheets of human beings with the ruling of reproductive and recitation, here the need came to the guidance of the goodness, And the religious history indicated that Noah was the first messengers who called for God Almighty.He started them in all of these verses with noon, and he did not remember Adam and in the hadith of reckoning in the authenticity, so that Adam says to those who do not have to do so, for those who will be raised with you.And his sin reminds him of the first Messenger that God sent to the people of the earth, and this is concerned that the sin of Qabil is not a violation He is a messenger and that he is a righteous, a good country, who is revealed to him by what he is refining his children and teaching them to the penalty.So the Almighty said (and God sent the prophets) is on the first face that is divided into what they say to him, the people of the people were one nation with one of them In the way of the will that their being) is a single nation as long as it is a period and then passed, and it will be seized on a sentence that is estimated by its estimation: so they will be disturbed, so they will be lost, and they are lost.The other face is separated from the universe one nation in falsehood, so the first is the first of the prophets who are close to Noah, because it is the first of the messengers for the sake of the elderly The first of them is Adam.The phenomenon is that Adam was not sent by a project for the reasons for this, but rather was guided as the educator guided his family.And what is meant by the prophets here is the messengers with his saying of his saying, and the book with them is the right to the right and the sake of the partner, and it is overlooked in the old and before it, Al-Fawahish because the corrupt criticism is the origin of (P-306), the act of the verb, and the people of the people of the idols worshiped, worshiped, and they are in kind, and they are in and hungry, and they are firm, and they are not.Adam and his sons In the mountains of being from the country of India as it was said, and in Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas: that friendly and kindness and glowing and disabled and ease were among the righteous people of the people of Noah, so what are the ones Their people were to set up to their sitting, which they were sitting with nursing and their name with their names, so they did, and they were not worshiped, even if you are, and if you are the first of you Uh., It was said that they were among the righteous people of Adam, and it was said that it is a kind of son of Sathi Qabil Bin Adam gave them a picture, then they worshiped them after three generations, and this is all a time that is overlooked in the old before the time, so it is not done, so it is not done It was presented by a project that was established by the project, a project in their righteousness in the Indian, so it starts before the thirty century before the migration.In this covenant, there was a great project in the abrasions, and the king of the ritual of the ritual, and the historians think that it was a contemporary of the Abraham, and that the peace be upon him.The travel of the formation in the name of “my king who is true” who was broken in Shameem and blessed Ibrahim and called him.And the resurrection: the transmission and the abortion of the walker, and from it the mission of the camel if it is upset after the blessing and the resurrection here is a metaphor that is used in the matter of God, the goodness of God.And (the prophets) is a collection of a prophet, which is an effective in the sense of an effective, derived from the prophecy, which is the important news, because God has informed him of the revelation and what is in the way It is attracted to him, for if he commands him to replace the nation’s project, then it is a messenger, and every Messenger is a prophet, and the Qur’an is mentioned in the majority of the Prophet, and the one who wants to do so The prophets are a hundred thousand and four and ten people who do not know their detailing and their faiths except God, the Almighty, he said: The Almighty and a century between that is many [Al -Furqan: 38] After Noah [Al -Israa: 17].And the number of the messengers is three and three.And what is meant by the prophets here is the messengers of them with the two villages of his saying, “Mission” and the two centuries of the situation in his saying: preaching and warnings, because he is the one who is a good The message, the preacher, and the category of what comes from its saying, and the book with them is revealed by the right to the right.(P-307) The definition in the prophets of the ostracism is the domination of the nickname of the world in the terminology of the people of the suffering.Al -Shara: The media is good, it will be obtained, and the warning is broken by the media, the media with human beings, and it will be obtained, or it will be obtained, and that is the promise and the good.The messengers are those who came with promise and return, and the prophets are not the messengers.They are their family Without calling until their people are among the men who are righteous, and the guidance of those who guided them from their people, and teach those who see it from the good.Then they might come supportive of the project that went on as the coming of Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes, to support the project of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and the coming of the Prophet, After Moses, to supply the supply, and they may not have a comment by law before them as a camel, Khalid ibn Sanan al -Abbasi, a prophet in the worshiper of the Arabs.And his saying: The book brought them up with them, the landing: its fact is the pseudonym of the body from the top to the bottom, and it is here that is metaphor in the prayer of the thing from the top, and it is from the highest The revelation came from God Almighty and referring to his intending from creation, so it is a response to the messengers on the side of his house.He added, “With the guarantee of“ the two prophets, “a summary and a disgraceful addition to“ without them to be reconciled to those who have been revealed to him as a book from them And Muhammad, and for those who came in support of those before him, like the Prophet of Sarayil, between Moses and Jesus.And the book is the one who is written, and it is called the terminology of the law on the validity, because God commands people to write it to the aspirations of its memorization and the ability to be able to do so It will be a truth if the project is at the time of launching, it was written or written as it is like the words of that of that book [Al -Baqarah: 1] on one of the two Here, and it may be a metaphor on the other direction, and what is here is carried on the truth because the bodies have come down, wrote, and written some of the parties A metaphorical conversion to which the time of time is intended, because the truth of the awareness is the comparison in the place and it is accompanying, and perhaps the choice of the meaning is for what is for the sake Treasure and victory said that I am with you, I hear and see [Taha: 46] and in the hadith: The spirit of Jerusalem is with you.And the definition in the book for the ostracism: that is, and it was revealed with the prophets, the books that all came down (P-308), and it is the interview of the collection in the whole, the meaning With every innocent of his book, and the consolidation of the expansion is a domain of the knowledge of the Samaids of the Shahhar that.Rather, the book did not say the books, because the individual and the collection are in the place of exposure to both, and it may be presented with the exotic and the payment of the reign One book with all the prophets; So, the intended to be used to be the exemption, not the era, and the owner of the scouts was allowed as the mother of the mother for the covenant, and the meaning was descended with each one.And the guarantee in the ruling is a return to the book, so the chain of ruling to the book is a mental metaphor, because it is shown in what the judgment has, or the verb.It is permissible to return the guilt to the name of Majesty; That is, God descended the book to judge between them, and the bond of judgment is a mental metaphor, because it is the cause of it and the command of the elimination of it, and the enemy of it, and it is for me to be.It has a government of him or him.The ruling of the book between the people is the right of the right, the adult, and the exemption on it, and it is when they differed in it in it, as it is for the purification of the truth, because the truth is not in the right Or a mistake, and this is what our scholars said that the calamity is in one of the two guidances.* * * And what is different in it except those who have been given after what the evidence came to them in order It is followed to a straight path of compassion on a sentence and the book with them is the right to the right of the right to be one of the conditions of the disagreement of the nations, which is the difference between the book of the book between And among the people of the single book, with one debt, and the meaning: the book was sent with them with the right, so he was disagreed with it, as he said: “He said: And the meaning and what is different in it, except for those who have written their books, so that he sought the rhetoric of the palace of the last sentence to include the sentence of the palace.(P-309) God sent the messengers to abuse the misguidance that occurred from the ignorance of the human beings with their salts, so the messengers came with guidance, followed by those who followed them, so he followed them, so he will follow them, and he will be satisfied with them.A delusion, so the messengers of the abuse of contradiction between the right and the falsehood, then the ancient followers of the messengers after them are one of them, and he is the one who disagrees with all the people in the people.What is meant by this is a wondrous manner in the state of humanity in their anusing to the misguidance, and it is a Tarikha truth from the wickedness of the bouquets, and warns the Muslims from the one.And exposing the people of the book, and they are the most famous people of the partnership, while they were made by their books from the difference in it, and this is from the sake of the Qur’an in the Qur’an Jews, which is an Arabic style, is a prostitute.Jarir: ؎ To a king of his mother, his father, his father, and he was not a dog that would make him and the guarantee of his saying in which he may return to the book and return to the right.The meaning is one of the two estimates, because the book was descended by the right to the truth and accompanied by it, then if it is disturbed in the book, it is disturbed in the right in which it is in the right and the one who is in the right Equality in the logic.And the difference in the book is the first leg of a partner in the deprivation of what is meant by a gold that contradicts the gold of the other in the origins What is meant by it.He came with the connector without otherwise The definitions of the wondrous matter, which is that the dispersed in the purpose of the book are those who have given the book to remove the disagreement among the people, so they are the disagreement between the people.There is a disagreement in it, and there is no doubt that that is invalidated by what is meant by it.The meaning is a disturbance of the state of those who have given them that they were worse than those who are different in the truth before the coming of the bouquets, because those of them have some of them with some of the ones After the writing of the book with their hands.And his saying after what the evidence came to them is related to the cost, and the sons are a group of evidence, which is the argument and the evidence.(P-310) What is meant by the evidence is the evidence that is the same as the disagreement in the purposes of the project, which are the texts that do not undertake the other hand The project, the defamation that is entitled to the rejuvenators, and the fools that did not call for a reason to be taken into account and do not know it.And the opposite bodies that have been opposed to the fact that each of them is in a state that does not oppose the condition of the other carrying, which is expressed in the origins of the first The project indicating the copying of the rule of another ruling, or what is based on the shrine of the sheikhs from the grace: this is people, or the judgment is like this, so it is so, so this is the same If the abuse of the nations would follow the truth.And the coming of the evidence is the manifestation of what indicates it and the appearance of what is meant by them.And the distance is here: the dimension of an advertisement that is not intended from the delay of the time of the difference from the coming of the sons, and if it is like that in the same matter, that is, the disagreement was in the case, that is, it was in the case of the disagreement.The right of the right to the deficit.And his saying between them is an effective for his sake to be lost, and the prostitute: the darkness and the origin of the prostitute in the words of the Arabs, then the righteousness of what is wrong with the righteousness.In the sense of injustice, it is secondly, and here it is called the envy, because the envy is injustice.The meaning is that the calling of the difference is the charity and the intention of every class that is seduced by the other, so the project is carried out, so it is not the same to spoil what it carried on the other It is right, and his mistake is his command.And his saying between them is attached to his saying in a way to seize that the prostitute is in the sense of envy, and that it is an injustice in the soul of the nation, and it is not.And he learned that each of the mourners was attached, which is after what they came and the verb attached to his sake, which is “loud” by saying that he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The emptying, and it is obligatory to be both confined to the verb of the verb that they are attached to, so that the dispute that the one who mentioned the pleasure comes from it Two things after a single deduction tool, because investigation is that what is here is not the same things, but rather the one who is one thing and those who have gave it, But it is restricted with two feet, which are after what the sons came to them and (Ghost) (P-311), as it is intended that the dispute was not among the people of the religion, and there was no one between the people of the debt Before the appearance of the evidence that is clear from the difference, and that disagreement was from the intention of goodness, but was among the people of the one religion, with the resurrection of the evidence.And the verse requires warning the Muslims from the fall, while the preceding nations are located in it from the difference in religion, that is, in the origins of Islam.Claiming in the origins of the project, it is collective, and they have gathered on the fact that they want to achieve it, and that is agreed to reach them in the search for the search His messenger to the one who is intended for the intensity of the street and its fragments, and agreed in the most terrible, but they disagreed with the help of the seed of the root of the sever Repeat the religion, and they all declare: that God has a ruling on every question, and that it is one ruling, and that he has assigned the mujahids, and that the one who is the one who is a sinner, and that the sinner, Less reward than his affliction, and that the failure is a sin.The difference between our scholars is a generous destruction of the destiny, expanding to view.As for if they followed their followers, then they will be victorious for their views with the weakness of the perpetrator or his mistake to intend The disagreement that God Almighty has blessed and warned us of him, so be the same as a warning and not to be like the saying of the nudity: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The truth in it is

of the Qur’an To guide the Muslims to the right in all that the people of the books are costly, as if the smoothness is the knowledge of the punishment of this disagreement, so that this is the one who is the difference.The coming of Islam, so God guided those who believed, etc.She exploded.(P-312) It is intended from those who believed in the Muslims, not the case, and the guarantee is in disagreement with all the dispersed, all of them, Whether those who disappeared in the truth before the coming of the messengers and those who disappeared in the bouquet after the coming of the messengers and sons; Therefore, it is clear from the truth, which is the right that its remembrance is presented in its saying and the book has with them the right to the truth, so if the jurisprudence is brought back to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who returns to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the right I am ignorant or unjust.And the authorization: The speech is a permitted permit, and its origin is derived from the verb of ears if his ears listened to the words of those who speak to him, then he was called on the discourse with the pornography Because of the

appealing to the face of the boss, because those who facilitate you are something, as if he has permitted you to take it.And in this gesture that God sent Islam to return people to the right and to the neutrality that they were upon him, or to return them to the right that came to the one who came to the one who came to the messenger, who came So their followers were lost in it, instead of achieving their understanding of the limits of what their messengers came with, so they obtained what is in Islam from the Qur’an from the Qur’an, who does not come The succession of the truth and the guidance to the Keffiyyah of its take, so he obtained the coming of Islam, the completion of what was descended from the successful batch.And his saying, and God guides whoever is brought to a straight path that is clear to the way that the grace of God will give him whoever he will be, and this is a scourge, and the detail of God is that the rule of God is that The deception of the guidance is delayed to the time of the project of the project of Islam, because the human beings are prepared with the coming of the preceding bodies of the acceptance of this project, the sake of the

first matter of his mother, a mother Sitting, then the misguidance was presented to him when the human ideas moved to him, the human beings returned to one religion in the case of the threats of ideas, and this is a wondrous union, because it came to the view, because it is a wondrous union, because it came to the opinions, because it came to the view of And the doctrine, and that is why the

it, so he said to them, they will complete the rest of your work, so it remained from the day from the day, and it is a good thing.The rest of their day, so they did the rest of their day until the
