The Quranic researcher (P-5) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, those messengers, so we preferred some of them to one of them who spoke to God and raised some of them, and we came to us.In the spirit of Jerusalem.The fall of this verse is the satelliteness of the frustration because of what he accepted and the presenter after it, but the first is that God is up to the one who has been blessed with the absence He showed them with their righteousness and sealed that with his saying: Those are the verses of God, and we call upon you the truth [Al -Baqarah: 252].Throughout all of that, and when all of that ended his punishment with his saying, and that you are among the messengers [Al -Baqarah: 252] reminding that his flags of the people of the nations and the Lord of the Prophet are the best of the nations His message, as his likeness was before the knowledge of that, without God, to God, and in this all an argument against the participants and the people of the book of the book.The slope of the name of the sign is the same as its location in the saying of the naps: The messengers are in his saying, and you are from the messengers [Al -Baqarah: 252] and it comes with a sign of the significance in it.He passed through the remembrance of the extent of the conditions of them and what they followed from their remembrance on the way of the bulls.As for the second, it is because when the saying was broken in the fighting and in the urging of jihad and adoption of the battle of the past nations, then it is that God will not be in the way of God The sons came to them, but they offended the understanding, so they fell asleep, so I would have a bad understanding of them.This administer is like the fall of the guarantee of the one, that is, the story of the messengers and their nations, so we preferred some of the messengers over some of the messengers of some of the nations So Juda lied to Jesus and praised them, prayer and peace, and the Christians lied to Muhammad.And the name of the signal is the same as the distance of the distance, and it intended to be his attributes as his saying of that book [Al -Baqarah: 2].(P-6) The name of the sign is starting and (the messengers) is a news, and the (messenge) is not because the album is about the group that it is the messengers and signed in the briefing of the group, the one who is the one.And the sentence (our preference) is a condition.What is meant by this verse is the glorification of the sacrifice of the Messenger, peace be upon them, and the Muslims know that his good category is with the greatness Other, and the reasons for the preference only know that God is the Almighty, other than that it returns to what has been done on their hands from the good deeds of the good, and from the goodness of the right, and from the good The way for that, and what they are supported by the great bias.The one who is overwhelmed in the guidance of the human beings, and in the general of that guidance and its strengths, and if the Messenger ﷺ says: “Because God guides you, a man is better for you, what is good for you,” God guided them with a nations in a punishment, and for the sake of that was Muhammad, the best of the messengers, and the words include a praise of them and the peace of the peace His people.And God has summed up from the sentence of the messengers with some characteristics that the intended one of them or the remembrance of his name, so he mentioned three, when he said: Whoever is the word of God, and this is the word of God, and this is the word of God.With this great special in the Qur’an, and Jesus, peace be upon him, mentioned the nods between them to Muhammad ﷺ with his description, with his saying: And his saying and raised some of them with trades that are intended to be one of the two messengers here, and not a sectarian, and the custodians will be from the rituals of the rituals The one; Because if it was intended from some of the sectors, it is beautiful, and from the grades there are grades between them, the words became a rier with his saying, and for our goodness, for the other I wanted some, and he was preferred to some of them.And upon him, the states are from the permissibility in the name or the description that is famous for the intention of the payment of the Honorable from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one It is expressed by some about the soul as it is in the saying of a good: I will take a possibility if I do not accept it ∗∗∗ or he will be stuck to some souls (P-7).And about the addressee, as the saying of Abu al -Tayyib: If some people are a sword of a state ∗∗∗ in the people there are times for it and the drums, which is appointed by the one who is intended in this is all of it.Or the description on one of the saying of Tarfa: ؎ If the people say: Whoever came to me, I was not Exalted: (And what we sent to them and a wallet [Al -Israa: 54] and your Lord knows who in the heavens and the earth, and we have preferred some of the prophets over some of the people: [Al -Israa: 55]) The Qur’an made us between you and among those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden veil [Al -Israa: 45] until he said: And say to my servants, they say: “The most good” is the one who is good.”[53] Some of the prophets preferred us over some [Al -Israa: 55]).This is a flag that some messengers are better than one over the face of the busts and the appointment of virtuous ones than the preference; That is that every class was bought in a good characteristic that they are not free than that some of them are better than some of some of the attributes of an excessive amount of money on the authority.And in the distinction of the attributes of the vigor, and the way of signing the mistake And the presentations, and that is not easy for the minds that are exposed to the neglect and the sin, then if the preference is that the Lord of the Group has predicted, and whoever is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the Almighty, To confront the place of the messengers in their paths, and the adherence to them with what God predicts in his book or on the tongue of his Messenger.This is the source of the authentic hadith, “Do not prefer among the prophets,” which is forbidden by the separation, with the disagreement of the preference, as well The best of the prophets who are not messengers.It was proven that Muhammad ﷺ preferred the messengers because of the verses that prefer him and the preference of the religion that he came with and the preference of the book that was revealed to him.It is a comparison of connotation, and the appearance of the appearance, except that its many are obtained by the two groups with a group of its suffering, with a base: God is the covenant of the prophets, as I have come to you from a book and a judgment, then a messenger came to you for what you are with you to believe in it and support it [Al -Imran: 81].(P-8) As for the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: “They do not say one of you, I am better than Yunus ibn Matti” means his saying (I) himself on the most likely to the one who does not say: You prefer me to Moses, "So that before he told him that God is the best of creation with him.This is a large number of them, which we have known: the mission of the mission of the people of the people, and its strengths are the length of the eternity, its seal for the messages, and the affirmation of the miracle of the miracle, not the greatness With magic and poetry, and with these miracles, and that everyone who qualifies himself is witnessed to realize the miracle, and with the custodian of the law on the authority of the law The spoilers and the dawn with the souls to the wage of the Khamal, and the facilitation of the condemnation of its supporters for it, and its assumption of their lands, their residences, and their money in a short time, and by making it.A frequency that is only ignorant of it, and the witness of his nation for his honorable grave, and they can be traveled from it and their impulses with it, and it has been overwhelmed by what is upon us.On the authority of Moses, peace be upon them, because of the severity of their two projects, because the law of peace be upon him, peace be upon him, is the best of the bodies, from what before it, with the disagreement of peace.And the choice of God is Moses, which is what he revealed to him with a mediator of Gabriel, that he heard him as a word that he was certain that he was confined to the formation of God, by the creation of God, from the creation of God.The establishment of the project, and that will come to that when he said, and God spoke to Moses Taklaim [Women: 164] in Surah Al -Nasi.And his saying: And Jesus, the son of Mary, came to us and supported him with the spirit of the evidence of the evidence, which are the shown of the brown, and the spirit of the sanctity is Gabriel.The private king, as his saying, descends the angels and the soul in it [Al -Qadr: 4].And the sanctuary is by the sake of the slope and the sacrifice of the signifier at the people of the Hijaz and its silence at the sons of Tamim in the sense of the mixtures and the integrity, so the addition of the spirit of the sanctuary is from the addition of the righteousness, and to the sake of the sake of the The Holy Spirit, and it was said: Jerusalem is the name of God as the Holy, and the addition of (a spirit) to it is an original addition, that is: a row from the angels of God.(P-9) And the spirit of Jerusalem is Jabriel.Its term will be completed.Rather, Jesus was described with these two with the fact that the messengers were supported by the sons and the spirit The Christians who have gone out, then they were lost, and for the sake of this, he mentioned with him the name of his mother, what he mentioned, to be alerted to him that the son of the human being is not for him God is up to the Almighty; Because the Arabs do not remember the names of their women, but rather they are, and they say: the Lord of the house, the people, and the like.And they mention the names of the women except in the spin, or the names of the slave.* * * And if God wills, what was followed by those who were after them after what the sons came to them, but they have disappeared, so whoever believes and whoever is disbelieved, and for those who are unbelieved, and if he does not, and if he does not, and God does not, and God does not.What he wants.Performance between the vineyard that benefits from the sentence of those messengers to the last, and between the sentence of you, O you who believe, spend what we have given: [254] He was ran from the matter of fighting and from the proverbs that have shown the characteristics of the courage and the cheese and their effects, the intended of it is legitimate and represented by the fighting of the people of faith for the people of the people And the victory of the truth on falsehood, the broadcast of guidance and the misguidance - showing God with these symptoms, the argument of those who fight in the path of God on those who disbelieve, that they disbelieved, for those who disbelieve, that they disbelieve, When they disagreed with what the messengers came to them, and if they followed the truth, they would be peaceful and named.Then it is permissible for the guilt to be added to him in his saying after them, intending for the sentence of the messenge The different in the domiciles (P-10), such as the fight against Jews and Christians in the right in the story of the people of the old people, and the fighting of the two sides of the sons of Israel And the fight against the Arabs of the Arabs, a victory for the misery of the misery that the dhikr built in the right, and the nations who were in the time of Islam and his soul and the murderer of the peace The participants who claim that they are on the religion of Ibrahim, the Jews and the Christians, and the intention of the sons will be the righteousness of Muhammad.The verse is over the people who stubborn the Prophet and the Muslims of the Muslims, and they killed them, and the verse is on this, the appearance of the separation on his saying, and the murderer of God in the way of God.244] etc.It is permissible for a guarantee that the messenge of the messengers is on the will of the savage, that is, those who are after every messenger from the messenge The messengers differed and killed and fought from the atonement of some of them, as it was signed for the sons of Israel in the many calamities in which there was a ritual in which they were brought up in the rituals of them Religion to the extent of the worship of the two, and as the Christians were located in a juice in which they were destroyed, they were destroyed to a limit that some of them disbelieved, so I fought against the time The Kingdom of Yahwah and the Kingdom of Israel, and the Christians as well as from the back of the disagreement between the punishment and the royal before Islam, and the most famous of the fighters of the sacrifice In the sixth century, I was established in the sixth century, between the righteousness of the Catholic and between the righteousness of the monk of the monk, who called the people who called the people who called the people to the people who called the people And the advertisement of the followers of the Catholic Kensea as disbelievers of their claims, the roots of the Christ, so I grew up with this war between Franks, Asbania, and Garm Europe.And what is meant is the warning of the Muslims from the fall in the same way as what happened in you, and the Prophet has warned ﷺ from that warning in a frequency of the words The deposit "Do not return after me as disbelief, and some of you will be harmed by one" one of you." The great prophecy.And it was mentioned in the correct saying: “If the conversation is thrown with their sons, then the death and the one who is killed in the fire, it was said: O Messenger of God, this killer, so what is the one who was killed?His brother, "And that one of him is explained by some that he is fighting against the disagreement.(P-11) It is intended to build on this involvement, the evidence of the clear project that separates the followers of the project, which is not accepted.If they were not the perseverance and the debt for the sake of the presentation of the world, the meaning is that God wanted to fight them, so they would be killed, and they will disagree with them, and they will be disturbed, and they will be disturbed, Cheation and estimation, not the will of satisfaction; Because the words are a marketer, the arrest of the wish of the answer and the evaluation of its abstinence and the use of it (if) as the saying of Tarfa: And if my Lord wanted Amr ibn Murthaid and his saying: But they disagreed with your repetition of what you include an answer, even if God wills, which is: (He did not say) It is necessary to oppose the answer (Lo), which is the conflict because they are They were lost, they were killed, and if they did not cost, they would not be killed.The fighting is left by them, that it created the calling of the difference in them, so that the preacher has disappeared, so they made them the dispute to his maximum, and it is the dispute in the sterility, and whoever is from them So they were killed because the necessity of fighting for this situation is a great knowledge, so if the intention is the one who disagrees with the nation of the one messenger, then faith and infidelity in the verse of the verse of the absence Religion is in it to the limit that leads to each other to disbelieve in it.113] Faith and infidelity in the verse are back, meaning: Whoever believes in the final Messenger, followed him and those who disbelieved in him, so he returned to him, so the two parties were killed.Whatever what is meant is from the two guys, then it is his saying, for those who believe and for those who disbelieve that he calls on that the difference that does not reach the disbelief is to the disbelievers of the disbelief The other is not informed of those who disagree with the fighting, because when God established for them from the evidence of the legs, what is in the sufficiency of the chapter between the disagreement in the disagreement of the disagreement, if it is not.The anger and the passion, or did not perceive the misunderstanding and the lack of guidance.There is no crime that God Almighty made in the creation of the minds, the choice of the height and the understanding, and made the remedy of the intelligence and the originality of the opinion as the reasons for the conflict A ride in the class, and for this he said: And if God wills, those who have come from after them (P-12) then he said: But they dispersed, then the meaning will be, and the meaning of God, for the sake of God.Merkuz in the jabbah, even if God has made it also in the minds of a severely harmonious origin or a belief in the belief of the piece of the piece of it The right is from the different opinions, so what people have noticed to follow it except the remote interpretations that are carried on the arrogance or the shame of the appearance of the appearance of al -Mughalb The rumors and the people of purposes, or the pursuit of an urgent offer of the world, and if God, God willing, he will not be engraved in the creation of spontaneity, the disturbances of the molice to his devastations, the bad of the bad ones But they disagreed with this disagreement, for those who believed and who have disbelievers, so no excuse in the fighting is only for two parties: a believer, and a disbeliever in what is in the other.Because the anger and the emerging beyond of the one who was in the debt in religion, they have been a result of a valid, and the righteous dispute between the people of one debt is one of the people who did not It is necessary to be a fight.This is why the Prophet ﷺ said: “Whoever says to his brother, O Kafir, is the same as it.[Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
