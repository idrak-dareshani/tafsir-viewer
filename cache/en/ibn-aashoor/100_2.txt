The researcher, the habitual, is a sacrifice, as the Mauritus is a praise.The love of goodness is tightened.God is divided with (the ordinary) the collection of the ordinary, and it is an effective name from the enemy, and it is the fast walking is called the biography of horses and camels in particular.The goodness of the human being described it and I think that it is likened to the horses and from it the enemies of the Arab The illiteracy of Al -Dahmari.They are set by the example in the enemy.This description is here because it is one of the unreasonable attributes.And al -Dabah: the corruption of the soul that is frequent in the carpentry is forced without it comes out of the mouth, and it is one of the voices of horses and the seven.And on the authority of Ata: I heard Ibn Abbas describing the lab.On the authority of Ibn Abbas, there is nothing of the animals, so that the horse, the dog, and the fabric are, and this is the saying of the people of the language, and it is confined to it in the dictionary.Ibn Jarir narrated with his bond to Ibn Abbas, who said: While I was sitting in the stone, a man came to me, so he asked me about the orders, so I said to him: The horses are in the He waved to the night, and they will make their food and become their fire.One before me?He said: Yes.And God was the first conquest in Islam for a blessing, and it was only with us, a horse: a horse for the Zubayr, and a horse for the one Knowing the clouds, and from the clouds to Mina.It means: that the surah is an angel before the conquest of the conquest, which is the first of the invasion of Badr.Ibn Abbas said: I was removed from my saying and returned to the one who said to me.And in the saying of Ali - may God be pleased with him - is not an angel or a civilian, and with the same as what Ali said, Ibn Mas'oud, Abraham, Abraham, Omim, And the sacrifice is not called the sound of the camels in the words of the language of the language.If it is carried (the orders) that it is the camel, then the mighty said, and some of the people of the language: whoever made it for the camels made it (a lax) in the sense of a fabric, it is said: She extended her fabrics in the walk.Abu Ubaidah said: The horses were laughed and flipped, if they are considered, which is that the horse extends its fabrication if it is no longer, that is: the labels are a language in the hyena, and it is from the heart of the eye.He said in the scout, “And it is not proven.” But the owner of the dictionary is intended and on the interpretation of the camels, that the camel will be the sacrifice of the vote of the camel, that is: from the severity of the enemy is strong The voices that are frequent in their wars until they likened the horseback, or I want the laxative to the eternity language.And he was (labia), so it is permissible to make a case from (the orders) if he wants the voice that hesitates in its welfare when the enemy, or it is made for a clear Its origin: labels.And on the face that the division of the pilgrimage is the pilgrimage, so the division is with it to glorify it with what you seek on the pilgrimage, and the division of the division with it; Because the smooth people are sure that what is divided into it is achieved, it is great at all among the polytheists and the Muslims.And Mauritus: which is to show, that is: it is lost.(P-500) and Join: Hold a body on another to praise a fire, it is said: Join Farshi.He (praise) was evident that it is an affirmative, affirmative for his treatment.Each of your horses and the appeals of the camels will be praised if the wandering is a fire that is called a fire that is called the fire of the parks.My descriptions met a chain of transmission from him, and this is a slit, and this is a seduction of the grace in the enemy and the intensity of the speed in the walk.It is permissible for the fire to be praised at night when we go to their needs and their food, and it is permissible for the Mauritus to be a slight praise for the excitement of the war; Because war is likened to the fire.He said: Whenever they drive a fire for war, the sacrifice of God [Al -Ma’idah: 64], and it will be (praise) to be a nomination of the (Mauritanian) and informing of the verb (Al -Mawarid) It is permissible to be (praise) in the sense of the ritual exit from the fate in the righteousness to feed the army or the knee, and it is derived from the name of the praise, which is the sacrifice ( It is based on the verb for its sake.And the seductions: an active name from: Agaar, and the raid is called the brush invasion, and it is the most famous of its launch.They kneel, but horses or latt the conquest are the reasons for the raid and the question.The raid is called the rush in the walk.And (sacrifice) is a time, so if the (heresies) are interpreted with the horses of the invaders, then the pious of that is based on the morning; Because if they were invaded, they would not be deceived by the people, except after the dawn, and for that he was warned of alive if his people warned about the coming of the enemy, he said: Oh Salaf, he said: In their sins, the morning of the warnings was worn [Al -Asfat: 177].And if the (gestures) are interpreted with the accelerated camels in the walk, then the meantic: paying it from the ritual to the morning of the day of the day and they were pushed by the thickness of the day Dhir, and from their sayings in that (I shine a dungeon as we are).(P-501) And they influenced it by falling into it: the dust from the ground from the severity of their enemy, and the excitement: the argument, and the soak: the dust.And the epidemic in (with it) is permissible to be a captive, and the bitter guarantee is based on the enemy taken From (Adiyat).It is permissible as the costume of the costume and the guarantee is based on (morning), that is: they affected that time, and it was the time when it was jealous.And the meaning of (Wasen): Be the whole of the group, it is said: The people were extended, if it is between them.And (collection) is a verb (and a compassion), which is a name for the group of people, that is: it was made in the mediation of the conquerors.As for the lineage to the camels, it will be a saying: (gathering), which is the ritual, so it is a sign of the camels in the ritual of the way that it is before it.Knowing, as there is no stable group in a place where these samples are prayed.And from the purpose of the systems and its miracles, the word (ordinary, and the Mauritus, the mauen, and the praise, the seductions and the morning, the mediator and the collection) without others; Because it is her graceful, she can be buried that the division of the conquest of invasion and the pilgrims of the pilgrimage.These first three descriptions were composed; Because the Arabs are called in the kindness of the adjectives and the compassion of the place that it is in fulfillment and it is for the punishment, and it is more than that it is for the obstacle of the arrival as it is in this Ibn Zubaya: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ And the fulfillment of the emotion of his saying: So they influenced him with an emotional soak on the description of (the seductions).It is given to it from the effects and description of the seductions.It is not an adulterer on a transitional characteristic like P-502) the three characteristics before it; Because the effect of the fall and the mediator of the collection is one of the effects of the rabbits, and it is not divided by them, but the oath of the first three descriptions.So, the chain of transmission is in his saying, and he affected him a signing, and they were gathered in it.Before the form of the name of the actor; To indicate that the words were transferred from the division to the story from the arrangement of what was arranged on those three descriptions of what was meant by the covered nomadic, which was for the sake of the sake of the one who was the one And the raid is its punishment, which is the solutions in the house of the people whom they invaded if it is intended by (the orders) horses, or the rhetoric of the pilgrimage to pay the payment of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a blindness) The pilgrim, the excitement of the soaks, they feel when the prayer is when the horses and camels stand in a motivation, so the man's man will be excited, so that it is a sequence in the time The group is crushed by people.On this face, it is permissible for what is meant by his saying: (Friday) the name of the ritual; Where the poet is forbidden.And the appropriateness of the division with these descriptions without it, if I want the souls of the pilgrims, which is the face that he was pleased with on the son of the son of Abi Taleb, which is the one who believes The division is upon him; Because the division of the poets of Hajj is only a righteous, where they are not believed that the Qur’an is the words of God, and they claim it as saying the Prophet ﷺ.And that I want (the hostiles) and what the horse of the invaders was overlooked, so the division is for the sake of the evolution and the crushing of the sense of the partners, that the lane of the cave, and it is a lamb Hold the soul of the prophet ﷺ from the hesitation in the secrets of the secret that he sent with the warning, Bin Amr.For the reassurance.And the sentence is that the human being has the answer to the answer to the division.And the chants: a description of the example of the exaggeration of Kanda, and the languages ​​of the Arabs are different in its meaning.Kinda and Hadmatat: the sinner, and the meaning: the unbelievers of God.And the definition in the human being is the definition of the sex as it benefits the exploitation often, meaning that (P-503) is in the manner of the human being for his Lord, that is: the disbelief of his blessing, and this is the best of this A human being on a recession in which he is only the prophet, and the fullness of the people of the righteous; Because it is an exhibiting that arises from the ingredient of the woman himself, and it is a matter in the jabbah that only the psychological monitoring and remembering the right to others.And that may be grateful or forget the right of God, and the human being feels that of himself in his dangers, and it is tied or overlooked by his possibilities; Because he works with the pleasure of itself, the same is varying in the ability of this creation from it, and the condolences are varying in the obituary.This is what he said to him, the Almighty saying: It is a martyr that is a martyr, and it is the love of goodness to harden Its money to the infidels of the grace, by saying and intending, or by doing and neglect, the tradition of stand For the sake of it, and it is varying, so this is a originated creation in the human being, so God has awakened God for him to be satisfied with themselves for the safety of this His Excellency said: The human being created this [Al -Maarij: 19] the verse.And his saying: The human being created from a hurry [Al -Anbiya: 37] and his saying: The human being is to seek [Al -Alaq: 6] that he saw him, seeking [Al -Alaq: 7] and may have been presented.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas, the human being here is the infidel, so it is from the well -being.It was narrated on the authority of Abu Al -Bahli with a weak bond.The chanters are its eating alone, that is, it is the rest of its food with him, or the rest of its hoopy food for some of the paths of the grace of the grave, and the rituals, and so And the like: His servant was struck by him, for there is a forgetfulness of the thanks of God, who made the servant a king of him and did not make him a king of the servant, so that he is more Just as the chants.It was said: الالالالار الم الم الن الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم ان ان ان ان ان ان ان ان الم ان الم ان الم الم الم الم ان الم ان الم ان الم ان الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم ان الم ان ان ان ان ا al -Daid ibn al -Mughira, and it was said: Qatarah ibn Abd Amr ibn Nawfal al -Qarshi.And the blame in (his Lord) is the mother of piety; Because as a description is not in the work, but it is related to the deeds of his actual seed in the derived, so it is more likely that it is done by the words Relaying his work.(P-504) and the adherence (to his Lord) to benefit the fulfillment of the attachment of these chants to mourn these agents that it is the Lord who is the most right of the rituals That is the blessing of the partners, and therefore the words emphasized the words of the inner in the news of the news (that) to be surprised by this news.And the old (his Lord) is presented to his prestigious workers in the words of the appetite, and it is one of the selfs of chest; Because they are expanding in the merchandise and eloquence, and the son of Hisham sees that the imitator of the appetite occurred in the news (that) is not the same as a matter.And Adam, and he is on that, a martyr ‌ ‌ ‌ to the human being according to the appearance that is required by the consistency of the conscience and the union of the speaker of it.And the martyr: It is called the witness, and it is the news of what is believed by a claimed claim, and it is called the present, and from it came his release on the scholar who does not miss it The approach is because he witnessed himself.And the martyr is here: either in the sense of the consequence, as in (I bear witness that there is no god but God).The meaning: that the human being is determined by his affection for his Lord from where he does not intend to decide, and that is in the girls of the sayings, such as the saying of those who are involved in the idols of their idols Let us bring us closer to God, [Al -Zumar: 3].This is a saying that their confession is obligatory that they worshiped what is not worthy of worship, and they shared in worship with those who deserved to be guided by it.Exalted: And they testified to themselves that they were infidels [Al -Anam: 130] and in the missions of verbs as it is presented to the Muslim in the sins.What is intended in this sentence is the expansion of the human beings that he is known to his friend with the lowest contemplation of his words and his acts.And on this, a (Ali) is attached to (a martyr) and the name of the sign is referred to it to the chants taken from the adjective (as a lord).It is permissible to be (a martyr) in the sense of (knowledge), such as the saying of Al -Harith ibn Halaza in Amr ibn Hindi: They are the Lord and the martyr on the one (P-505) And a relationship (a martyr) is a deleted man, that is, the man is aware that God is his Lord, that is: with the misfortunes of the rabbit, and it is the saying of God: That is, with these chanters, he is knowledgeable that his Lord is fulfilled for thank you and obedience, not for the universe.And they feed the food on his love [man: 8] and the saying of Al -Harith bin Halaza: ؎ So we kept our singing sleep ∗∗∗ We are horses and pride, the neighbor, the neighbor, and the mourning in the position of the situation, and that is an increase in the admiration of the human being.Ibn Abbas, Al -Hassan, and Safyan said: He (and he is) is a hand to his Lord, that is: God is upon that for a martyr By warning against it.This is notified by the fact that the guerrilla is a source of the male, and it was transferred from Mujahid and the mourning of both the two favors, so perhaps they saw the permissibility of the two bosses.And it is presented to that (martyr) for the imitator, admiration and observance of the separation.Al -Shadid: Al -Bakhil.Abu Dhuib said: “We warn him with rewards in the broken mit.Also, Tarfa said: The reason for the money of the thorns and the pain in the love of goodness is the mother of the illusion, and the good: the money, the Almighty said: if it is left good [Al -Baqarah: 180].The meaning: In the creation of the human being for the sake of the love of money, that is, the benefits of it, the highest said: And whoever yearns for its souls, then those are the one.The love of the love of goodness on his attachment to the pace of this stubbornness of this attachment and for the sponsorship of the separation, and his assumption of his prestigious workers with the ritual workers of the ritual Because it is a boredom as you have learned in his saying: His Lord has a model.And the love of money is sent to prevent the known, and the Arabs were lending to disturbance while they are with (P-506), so they are stingy in the ignorance of the infection of the poor and the weak, and the weakness, But they seek spending in the suppression of the hearing and the sitting of drink and in the facilitator.He said: (And do not embrace the food of the poor [dawn: 18], and you eat the heritage, eaters, for a while [Al -Fajr: 19] and you love money with great love [Al -Fajr: 20]).
