The researcher, and when we said to the angels, they found for the Adam, so they found only the best of my father and the arrogance, and he was among the disbelievers.Caliph [Al -Baqarah: 30] The compassion of the story is on the story and the return of the time after the ritual kindergarten from returning its kindness to be alerted to it that the sentence is not the same With this wondrous story, it came to the repetition, which is authorized to be eliminated and fulfilled.The separation, so he says, "We say to the angels, so they may be brought up, and if they are in the event, they are separated from the ones before it For the sake of the appearance of his advantage over them, when they did not know what they did, and that is what it is required And the earth and what is after it from the phases of the origins of the lands are the land and what is between it and between the sky, because the origin of the words is that the arrangement of its organizer is a neighbor on the path The outside did not establish a consort on the contrary.And his words are not perpetuated in the wall of the stone that I am a good man who is from the righteousness of an elderly flesh [Al -Hijr: 28] So if I settle it and I am blowing it from the soul of the soul of it, then they will fall Because that, the storyteller tied up with an extent, so it was folded by the news that came to show it in what was passed from it in other verses and explained by any cow to the righteousness Adam did not appear to the angels, except after learning the names and presented them to them and their elderly I will be spoiled in the land after being the side of standing for what God said to them (I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30]) So he was a burden They were briefly from the news of it to reveal their likeness, so they deserved to come to what is in it exclusive about their knowledge.(P-421) I wanted from this story to the end of the type of human being, and that God specializes in the gender of his creatures and its types of what is required Like they are not free from a dedication of his presence in this world and the shame of the virtue of the known, and that the scientist is true to the greatness The Satanic evil is from the malice and corruption, and that it is a confession to the right of the characteristics of the Malaki, and that corruption, envy, and arrogance are from the blame of the one who has the mind.And the saying in a syntax, as it is like a saying that was presented in the interpretation of his saying, and when your Lord said to the angels, I am making in the land a successor [Al -Baqarah: 30] Here, without the two people, as they say it (they said: Glory be to you) and say it (When they woke up [Al -Baqarah: 33]) so that the story is given in the same way as the title of the story, which is given to it as a reference to the Garden of the Him.Included, unimaginable in the story before it.The chain of transmission of the saying to God was changed to God, and he came to him, supporting the guarantee of the greatness (and when he said) and he brought him in the precedent verse, supported by the Lord of the Prophet) For art, and because the saying here includes an act of verb in which there is an abundance on the affairs of the affairs, the appropriateness of the bone of the command, and the saying of the one who says: In his response to show their opinion, and the intention of the composition of the spread with the principle of the formation of the first self from the types of human being in need of the chain of transmission to the one who is in the way The profitable profile by the mobilization of the two educators.It was added to the annexes of the two siblings, which is the prophet ﷺ as it was presented with the saying of the Almighty, and when your Lord said to the angels, I am making the earthly the earth: 30] The body of the body or its rhythm on the ground with the purpose of the glorification of a witness to the two people, such as the prostration of the king, the master and the prostration of the deceased, and he said: They prostrated to the sun or to the moon [Chapter: 37] and Al -Ashi said: When he came to us, we found it, we found it and we were filled with us and said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ P-(P-422) to see the imagination and the briefing, which is the prostration of God.As for the prostitution of the angels, it is a representative of a condition in which they are indicated by a greatness, and its suffering has gathered his saying, and God is prostrating in the heavens, and there is no one in the heavens They arrogate [Al -Nahl: 49], so the prostration was the first to a greeting by human beings at the creation of the scientist.The prostration has been known since the roots of the rocks of the history, so it has been found on the two -ninth century before the twenty -ninth century before the Christ, the image Raki in front of the sun.The Egyptian monuments were found, the piots of the captives of the war were found to be a prostration to the two pads, and the prostration was dispersed by the contradiction of the people.The prayer of the prayer is different from the contradiction of the religion.And the prostration in the prayer of Islam is the perpetrator of the land with the forehead, the hands and the two men.And the intensity of their prostration to the name of Adam with the imam indicating that they have been charged with the prostration of itself, and it is the origin of the connotation of the mother of the illusion if it is suspended by the subject of the prostration So prostrate to God and worship [Al -Najm: 62] and say it do not prostrate to the sun or the moon [Chapter: 37] and it is not concerned that the prostration is in Islam for the sake A new jurisprudence that was copied what was in the last of the other, and because the angels were made of work The highest world, and that is not under the interior of the people of the land, so it is not permitted under the end of the search in that Adam is a prisoner for him or is a kiss for the sake of the people.There is no need to cost to make the mother in a sense to the same in the saying of Hassan: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ It is not appropriate for it to be measured by the best of words.In this verse, it is bodied to the greatest of knowledge and the generosity of the scholars with the greatness and the exaggeration, because God did not know the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge Adam, who is a model for the prevalence, the fools, and the sciences that appeared in the human beings after that, which will appear to the annihilation of this world.(P-423) Abu Jaafar read in the months of the narration from it (for the angels, they prostrated) with a guarantee of the p Because the one who is more than the one who is in the voracious one is between the two letters, because it is a need that is not a fortress, and its readers are this narration, and it was a journey on a weak language in this Al -Zajaj and Al -Farisi: This is a mistake from Abu Jaafar, and Al -Zamakhshari said: It is not permissible for the Arabs of the Arab movement to be in the past of the soil, except in a weak language as a weak language.For God, “Burr Al -Daleh said, Ibn Jinni said:“ It is permissible for this one who went to the father of Jaafar if what was before the hamst Yosf, uh.Rather, they carried this bearing because his readers are numbers in the frequent readings, so what was improved in it is like this anomaly, even if it is anomaly in the man The drawing of the journalist.And the compassion of (glorified) with the fulfillment of the punishment, which indicates the initiative of the angels with compliance, and they did not repel them from what was in their soul And the shedding of blood because they were removed from the ticks.And the discretion of the incense of the angels in the “prostration” is a discontent, because the Bellis was not from the angels of the angels.[Cave: 50] But God made his conditions as the most powerful souls with a separation that prevailed over his mountains, so that his pensions came to him and his souls, and he will see it.I will be in the case of their condition in the mind that it is a similar one for those who are in them.The verse was indicated that Ebsus was intended in the news that the angels were informed of, as he said to the angels that I am in the land of the earth, and in Al -Baqarah: Al -Baqarah: 30] As he said to them, they found to the Adam, that is that the gender of the deceased was in that world as a voracious one by the property of the king, as God created from their kind of people as a lot of people as a lot of people, as well The group is in his saying, and when your Lord said to the angels [Al -Baqarah: 30] and not God creates from the types of gin except their origin, and he is a trick.He was created from the type of human being, and he is Adam.And God has established a Plice between the angels, the residence of the abyss, the creation, and its mockery to follow their Sunnah, so it will run on that Sunnah as long as it is a long time that does not know His type is from the slag, as his saying referred to him (so he was immoral from the command of his Lord [Al -Kahf: 50]) in the Surah of the Cave, so he cursed his Lord when he commanded him.(P-424) and the first name of the Satan, who is the birth of the demons, so he was a Plice of the norm of the demons and the gin in the house of Adam for the types of human being.And the same name is an Arab name, which is not an Arabic language, but the people of the language are not appointed, but it is indicated by its formation of Arabs that the Arabs prevented him from the sake of the sake And the domain, and this is what he made the ghost of his original, and he said: He gave it to the verb.And Abu Ubaidah said it is an Arabic name that is derived from the licks, which is the distance of good and the most miserable A factor because his thumb is more and has been seen from his prevention from the behavior that he did not have a counterpart in the Arabic name, and it is the most promising.And the most of those who counted the words that are Arabized in the Qur’an, and they did not return from the name of Ebsis because they did not show that, and for the sake of the name of the name of the name of the name she has.My father was sentenced to and the infidels, and he was a dowry, indicating that the violation of his condition is for the state of angels in the prostration of Adam.How did he do the same as what he was commanded by and how he is the state of his group, and what caused that is because his violator is for the state of his man The groups, as Derid Bin Al -Saham said.؎ And I am only from the invading if I died ∗∗∗ I was alone, and if you guided the invading of the guidance, he showed the reason that he was my father, arrogant, and disbelieved in God.And the abstaining parents of action or its consequences.And the arrogance is the severity of the arrogance and the Sunnah, and it is in it for the time that it is the same as the greatness: He stabilized, so I am arrogant to the arrogance.The meaning is that he is arrogant to God with the denial of being a delegation that he was prostrating to him, for him to have a denial of a silence that is not a budget or a pronouncement, as well His saying said that I am better than him, you created me from a fire and created it from clay [Al -A'raf: 12].Development is sorry [Al -Baqarah: 30] because that was on the face We sanctify you [Al -Baqarah: 30], so I can see his fathers, the gabbah that was first on the first time, so it was referred to the last jelly For a sane when his mind is dispensed.And for the leadership when some of its members are paralyzed.And from the hearts of a generous heart, and the hearts of spirituality, as he said: (P-425), so I was as a man of a healthy man ∗∗∗ and a man in which the time was thrown.The increase in the arrogance is because the Sunnah and the Ta’a in it is for the sake of the language, not for the request as you know, and from the opponents of the Arabic language that the material of Al -Tawasif is not from the arrogance The activity or the verb indicated that the owner of the arrogance is only asking for the oldest or the cost of it, and what is really great and the improvement of it is that we say that we are the saying Al -Ala'a: You have made a trust in trust ∗∗∗ when the mourning of the people was placed on the crushing of the greatness of the oldest, in which the pretext of Islam said in the book of life: the pride in the righteousness of the And the people who have the soul of the woman himself, according to the arrogance of it, for the oldest, the arrogance calls for it and the arrogance of it and the arrogance of it, and the arrogance of it.The wonder does not call for the other hand, and it is not sufficient for the woman to be overwhelmed by his soul, so that he is arrogant, for he may increase his soul, and he will be the same We himself or similar to it, so it is not arrogant to it, and it is not enough for it to be decided by others, for it is with that, even if he saw his soul, he did not say, and he did not Like himself, he did not grow up, but rather see himself as arranged, and otherwise, and then he sees his soul as a matter of his soul, and he is not.The three critics will obtain the creation of the oldest, and this contract is blowing in it, and it will be in itself, a single, proud, joyful, and blessed in it, and it is in what it is in the way of what it is lost, That is, so that pride, shaking, and hiping to that hoping is the creation of arrogance.This is the verse and its organizations, as a result of the difference between the scholars of the origins of jurisprudence, while the condemnation of the discretion is required by the ruling of the ruling, so that the ruling is the one who is proven to be The discretion requires the equity of the chaste by the elaboration of what the exalted be judged by it, so this is the most likely to be satisfied with the discretion without being done by the one who is not followed.For the one who is exclusive, the words were stabilized or exile.And this appears in the word of martyrdom, there is no god but God, for if it is not for the benefit of the discretion that the insinuation is proven to him, we will be able to do what he has gone to.The word of the testimony is not useful, except for the deity of the divine, as far as God, so that its al -Wahidiya benefits for God with commitment, and the father of Hanifa said: I prove to me, we are the one who has been judged by the one who has been governed by it It is beneficial, except that the conjugation proves to him that we do not judge the judgment, and we do not judge the ruler, so the one who is excluded with the house of the silence is from the authority of it, (p-426) It is a way out of the desired description of it for the one who is excluded from it, and when Abu Hanifah al -Mustaqni is a way out of the judgment on it, then it is like the silence.And the late people of Hanafis are among the discretion between the words of exile and the discretion from the words that are proven that both of them do not refrain It is for the one who is excluded from it, and this is a weak opinion that the language does not help nor the resources of its recovery in the project.So I think the phrase will be the sentence of my father and the arrogance of a bayyan, and on my opinion of the Hanafi, it will be in the way of the way that it is required of it A pilgrimage that cuts the new ones between the two parties.And the sentence (and it was one of the disbelievers) was given to the arrogant sentence, and (it was) is only beneficial that it was described by the infidelity in the time of the time before the time of the time, and the time of the verse, He described it before his abstinence from the prostration of Adam, and you may be confused more of the beneficiaries in the two meaning With the disbelief, while the time to abstain from the prostration, and from the beginning that it was not a separate day, described the infidels, so they needed that they would have come.In the knowledge of God, and some of them were filled with the fact that the Ebis was the appearance of the obedience, with the disbelief of the disbelief, and God is divorced on his interior, but he did not tell him To see what he said to him is the Almighty saying that I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30], and all of that is a sense that I do not have to do not know that I have known that the one who has been done is that Before the time of the spoke, and the most like them is a way that they made (it was) in the sense that it became, it is a resignation from the use of the verb “it was,” he said: [Hood: 43] And he said, and the mountains were dressed with a dress.Its illness, which has become a disbeliever in the vastness of the prostration, because his abuse was established from his adoption of God and he met that what he was commanded by is not the right to the right of the ruling He showed Apple in his mountain, which was a drought in the ruling of God Almighty, so he became in it a spawning.And that I see the best of the faces in a meaning and was one of the infidels that it is necessary to say that he said and disbelieved as my father said and he was arrogant, so he was amended from the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was from ( (P-427) In the example of this recovery on the seat of the meaning of the news in its name, and the meaning is my father and arrogant and disbelieve in disbelief in itself, and this is As he said, he was glorified, and his family was spared, unless his wife was among the people [Al -A'raf: 83], and his words are high, we look at the end of the He says that she does not be guided because if she sees a verse that denys her throne and did not be guided, she was righteous in Al -Safaf, with the number of deduction, and as for the two news, it was (from the infidelity) In a disbeliever, because the proof of the description of the Sufis of the title of the one of the Sufis is one of the groups of that description, indicate the severity The description has proven to him alone by building that the one is clinging to touching his verb if he had been shared by a group; Because it is in the capacity of what he sees from the many people who are confused with the same as his action, the distance of itself from the hesitation in the payment of its work, and the one who said: The liars [ants: 27] and his saying, whom we mentioned a nose, or will it be among those who do not guide [ants: 41], which is a semantic and dwelling in the absence A day is a group of infidels, but it was just and only in the infidels.This is a tendency to follow the followers of the likes of this installation in these two specifics; The privacy of an increase in the privacy of the description of the description of the title that it is one of the groups of those who are supported by it, and it will come to that, and it will come to him.With the knees [Al -Baqarah: 43], and when he was not in the time of the abstinence of Eselis from the prostration, a group of the infidels was his saying (and he was from the infidels) on the one Al -Kinary.And in this enemy on the necessity of the phenomenon, taking into account what is required by the virtues of the faction as well, and the three news was arranged in the remembrance of the case, according to the arrangement of the existence This is the first in the creation to be the formation of the words as a way for the formation of the significance of its sentences as its saying, and when our messengers came to them, and he said: A chasm day [Hood: 77] and I have indicated to that in my book, the origins of construction and discourse.
