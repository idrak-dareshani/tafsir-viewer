The Quranic researcher who disbelieved before you, who are in the right of the right and from the north, is my dear.Dakary and miracle of the involvement of the partners to the Prophet ﷺ mockery of what they hear from the age of the believers in paradise and the return of the two parties.That was made on what he said in his saying, those in the generous gardens [Al -Maarij: 35].The meaning: that those who disbelieve are not attributed to the entry of paradise, so why do they try to collect them around you with the features of their mock?.This is, even if it is a discourse for the Prophet ﷺ, then what is meant by informing them of them when they are attached to them (P-176) from the Qur’an, so it is directed to them in the same way It is forbidden by the ritual ritual, as it is not appropriate for it to be a flag for the Prophet ﷺ for that; Because it is a determined thing in his knowledge.And the meaning of what is for those who disbelieved: anything that has been proven to those who disbelieved in the event of their being at you, or if they obey you.And he said when he said, “They said:“ We will not fight in the path of God, and we have brought us out of our path [Al -Baqarah: 246] in the cow.And the installation of (what he has) is not free from a unique condition, or a sentence after the interrogation, is the infection of the calamity.It is permissible for the situation to be the case for the conqueror here, that is: before you, and it will be a stable and the owner of the situation (for those who disbelieve).It is permissible to be (shouting) and be (before you) as a disagreement attached to the (bastard).And on both vicinity, they are the effects of strangeness from their condition, so they have made the place of wondrous, the other course is rewarded for it in the installation.In the Misfaq was written in the (those who), it is separated from its entry, which is a brilliant drawing.And the obedience: the extension of the neck with the walk as it is presented in its words, the Almighty (who is broken to the bid [the moon: 8]) in the surah of the moon.The one said, Al -Baghwi and Ibn Ahtiyah, and the owner of the scouts: The participants were gathering around the Prophet ﷺ and they listened to his words and lied to him, and they lied to him, And they say: If he entered these paradise, as Muhammad says, let us enter it before them, and for us to have more than what they have.So God revealed this verse.And kiss: a name in the sense (at).And the custody is presented to those who are in order to fulfill it; Because the strangeness of their condition in the presence of the Prophet ﷺ is stronger because of the sparkle.And the fall of his saying about the right and the north is like a satellite before you and the satellite of the two.And the intended: the many flaws, that is: and return to you.(P-177) The definition in the Yemeni and the north is the definition of gender or a thousand and the blame is compensated by the added to it.What is intended is the remembrance of the right and the north: the surrounding of the flaws, so I should be satisfied with the remembrance of the Yemeni and the North, because they are the two sides They are overlooked, and the same is the saying of Qatri ibn al -Fajaa: ؎ I am lying to the generosity of the one who is in the time of me once and in front of me he wants: from every side.And (dear) is a state of those who disbelieved.Izzan: Glory be to be gathered, by lowering the zai, which is the difference from people, a name with a verb.Its origin is an attribution of a loser, and it is not a time.A gathering (glory) was done to attach to the gathering of the male who is the same as a measure, and it is from the door of a year of every three -year -old, which was deleted, and he was not for his mother, Like a bit (for cutting).This is the installation in his saying, “So, for those who disbelieved before you, who are groaning to his saying (the paradise of Naim), it is permissible to be a liking, in the case of a dedication, Hurry up to the Prophet ﷺ in the case of those who think that the pleasure is to seek guidance and the acquisition of the forgiveness to enter Paradise,; Because the matter is not to be satisfied with the Prophet ﷺ unless they seek to appeal to his guidance.And understanding this is used in the origin of it; Because the representative runs in the group of words with the meeting of its words on its entitlements.It is permissible for the words to be a useful in the event of the state of their speeding up, then their denying them and their mockery.And the sentence of all of them is reassuring from them to enter the paradise of a nickname with a detection of a sentence, so the nams of those who disbelieved before you are the ones who have the verse,;
