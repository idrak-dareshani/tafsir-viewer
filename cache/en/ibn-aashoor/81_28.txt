The Quranic researcher is only a male for the two scientists for those who want you to be upright.After their horizons from their misguidance, they guided them to the realization of the Qur’an with his saying: It is only a male for the two worlds, and this is the sentence that is the same By saying a dominant Satan [Al -Takwir: 25], and that was repeated from the emotion, so that the shortfall that benefits from the negation and the discipline in its saying: that it is only for it.The Qur’an is palated in the name of the remembrance, that is: there is no other one and it is an additional minor from it that is the heroes of it to be a saying of a poet, or the saying of a priest, or the saying What is reported by the insignificance is that it is a saying of a dominant Satan, and therefore there was a certainty in it for a sentence and what is the saying of a ruler of a dignitary [Al -Takwir: 25].And the male is a name that collects the suffering of supplication and preaching with the good of the work and the dirt from the falsehood and the misguidance, that is: the Qur’an is only a reminder to all the people of the people Their beliefs, obedience to God, their Lord, and their ethics, the etiquette of some of them with some, and the preservatives of their rights, and the regimen of them They are among them among the nations who did not follow it.So the two worlds prevail in all human beings because they are calling for the insult to it and those who are in from what came in it.If you say: The Qur’an includes the hadiths of the prophets and the nations, which is also a miracle of Muhammad ﷺ, so how is he short of his being mentioned?!I said: The additional palace is not intended from it, not to be drawn up with the description of the description of the lineage to a special attribute, for you to make the short The Qur’an (P-166) is on the remembrance without other than that of the attributes, because what is deducted from it from the stories and the news is intended by the preaching and the burden of the sake of the sake of which Seven.As for his miracle, he has a great income in the memory; Because his miracle is indicative of that it is not in the manna of humanity, and if he knows that, the leanness is a right.And it was replaced by the two scientists for his saying: Whoever wants you to be upright with some of each of all, and I will be restored with the exile of the act of the act of the same as the one who is in the same way His saying is up to the Almighty: And from the palm tree from its rituals, it is a bottle [Al -Anam: 99] and his saying: The mill who have been arrogant from his people for those who are among those who have been disturbed, It was presented in the Surah of Antam.And the speech is in his saying: From you to those who have been given his saying: Where do you go to [Al -Takwir: 26] and if the Qur’an is a reminder to them and they are from the sentences From the rest of the two worlds, too, with the rule of equality, in the speech, it is like that.And the extension of this replacement is that those who remember the Qur’an are the Muslims who have wished to be the ruling for them To them.And in The concept of the prayer is an illness that those who did not remember the Qur’an are what is between them and between the remembrance of it, except that they did not follow, but they would not be satisfied, but they would not be satisfied With the sake, that is, the bad deed and the criticism, so that those who are aware that these are the first on the misguidance, not the shortcomings of the Qur’an from their guidance, but they are, but they are, but they are, but they are, but they are, but they are, but they are, but they are, but they are.With it, either for the majority, they have said that our hearts are what you call us and in our ears and a cow and between us and between you a veil [Chapter: 5], or for the one who said: Keep, do not hear for this Qur’an and seduce in it, so that you may be overpowered [Chapter: 26].And the righteousness is based on the salvation of the inner work, which is the criticism, and the most prominent, which is the verbs and the sayings that resemble it to work with a straight line, which is a reasonable.Those who did not follow up to straighten the disbelievers with the Qur’an, and they are the market for them, and they are attached to them on the amounts The Qur’an is one of the Muslims, for it is what he wants to be upright because of what he has been overlooked in conditions, or aspirations, or a place.(P-167) In this verse, a sign of a clear indication is that it is a mistake that the state of Islamic religion is weighing with the balance of some of the Muslims or their greed as well The apostate of the West, and others, as they make the face of their view of reflection in the Islamic state of the Islamic Nations and they are extracted from the rulers They make her cases for their signs in the Islamic religion.This verse is easy to prove the will to the sane person while he comes and is called, and that there is no excuse for him if he says: This is an estimated matter, and this is a bound by God They put it in the other hand, and that is the saying of albumian, and it is proven to the servant as a loss or an estimated destination.
