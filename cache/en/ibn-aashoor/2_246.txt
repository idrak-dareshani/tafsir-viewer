The Quranic researcher (P-484) did not see the fullness of the sons of Israel after Moses, when they said to us to have a source of them.They are fighting, they said, and we will not fight in the path of God, and we have brought us out of our visits and our children, so when the fighting was written on them, they did only a few of them, and God knows best.The sentence did not see the fullness of the children of the seconds of the second exile after the sentence of what you did not see to those who came out of their exercises [Al -Baqarah: 243] God [Al -Baqarah: 190] and in it an increase in affirmation of the rush of the state of the failure of the fighting after the greeting in the path of God, and the proverb in the same is the benefit of the more With the time; For those who are taught to dirt in his saying and fight in the path of God [Al -Baqarah: 190] Do not leave those who are alienated by whom they are confused about them They are exposed to them, the deaths of the death, when the scenes of life, and the injustice of the humiliating, then God struck for these two cases.His saying did you not see to those who were brought out of their path [Al -Baqarah: 243] and the second is his saying, did you not see the fullness of the children The fighting is between them, and the appropriateness of the first time that it is the state of those who were delivered and weakened them I have been attributed to be presented between the hands of the matter and defense of the egg; Because the matter is then that it falls on the entire fabric of the acceptance, not a referral, and the appropriateness of the second last is that it represents the state of those who are in the case To say them and what we do not fight, etc.So they asked him without being imposed on them, so when the fighting was appointed to them, they will be on their afterlife, and the place of the lesson is the warning of the one who is like the case Prayers in the fighting, or after he wrote to them, has the rhetoric of this speech, and with the purity of these sins: annexation and delay.The saying was presented to you, you did not see in the verse before this.And the fullness: the group whose things are one, and it is the name of a group, such as the people and the struggle, as if it is derived from the mill, and it is the perpetrator of the water with water, and it is the same For their saying: Fill out people if they agree on anything and all are taken from the fullness of water; They were filled with their closeness and their consciousness every evening, when the response, then if it is filled (P-485), one of the other is sufficient for something that is not important; Because the water is the consolidation of life, they are struck by an example to give up the beneficial matter with which the life of life, and the acting of water in the example of this is the same With a Quraysh, they have been Cut my mercy and warm my vessels.Acting to waste their right.And after Moses, he said that the companions of this story were with a prophet after Moses, because the time of Moses was not in which there is a staple of money, as if it is a good.They lost the integrity with the time in which their messengers were among their backs, so they were saying: You went and your Lord is fighting [Al -Ma’idah: 24] Their messengers and the intended: the expression of the warning of Muslims from the difference against their Messenger.And the denial of “a prophet to them” to the sign until the place of the lesson is not the person of the prophet, so there is no need for his appointment, but the intended is the state of the people, and this is the one who is in the Qur’an.The prophet is the cumus, and it is in the Arabian Shamil with the dirty osteoporosis, and for that he did not say: when they said to their prophets, as this is not this prophet, with the authority of him They are known to have an addition.And in his saying (for the innocence of them) is a support for the saying of the scholars of the grammar, if the origin of the addition is that it is the ability of the imam of the run, and the meaning of the sack of us.This is that when a king did not have a king in the case of the need to a king, as if the king is absent from them, and as if their condition calls for his presence, then if he is appointed to his own Absent from them, and he was sent to them, or he is arrogant from the mission of the camel, that is, his abortion of the walker.And what you said are if you wrote the verse, a condemnation and a warning, and he said: Do not fight, do not understand it, and he is a person who is a person who is not.Separate, and indicative of the condition of the condition, if the fighting is written on you, and this is the creator of brevity: he has told a large number of people who were in the words of them, and that is in the words of them, They are the intention of the integrity of the fighting, with a blessing and a blessing for the destiny of their determination to it, and for that he came in the infidelity of the denial, so he said: You are fighting; Because the one who is accused of it is the most correct way at the one who is the one who is the one who is the other one, and if the other side is estimated, and if the understanding comes out to its suffering, the metaphor of the metaphor, then it is the reward of the metaphor.The choice of the shameful part is sure.And he signed from them the rest of the fighting and warned them of the numbers of the fighting if they were imposed on them, then a sentence: that you will not fight, and all of them will be disputed, so that you will not be, and I will be given, and I will give you, It was acknowledged that, and it is a sign of the rest, and it is valued for every factor that it requires.What is meant by this is the urbanization: because the dignity (P-486) ​​is denied from its attribution to the default, then if it is recorded on it before it was before it and the dormitory of the And his fall in the future, as he says whoever recommends otherwise: do so and so and what I think you do.And he read a bonus, so I had the right to break the cinema on other than measurement, and the generosity read it with the opening of the Sunnah They are two lines in “maybe” if the guilt of the speaker or the addressee is connected to it, as if they were intended to break the cinema of the sine of the death of the cousin.And his saying said that we do not fight in the path of God, and the kindness came in the story of their saying; In their words, it is what benefits the will to be their answer to his words, given to their words So they wanted to confirm their desire, in the help of a king who praises the matters of the fighting, that they deny every risk that is dangerous in their souls, so that they will be made, so they will be from the ritual, so they will be made from the rituals, so they will be from The words of their prophet in the house of the words that are supposed to be done during their words, which they are full, so what they have to do with their answer is about the doubt of their prophet in their steadfastness.The way of his saying is a story about the messengers, and for God, let the believers trust, and we will not trust in God and our paths: 11].And what is the name of the question in the sense of anything, and the blame for the eternal and the understanding is an inception and my arrogance from the saying of their Prophet, are you, if you have written to you, if you have been able to fight you He was a fan of him to ask about his reason.And the name of the questioner is in the position of the appetite, and we have his news, and its meaning: what He got to us or what is stable to us, so the blame is in his saying to us, the mother of the deceased, and the ritual of the ritual ونُقاتِلَ مَنصُوبٌ بِأنْ, ولَمّا كانَ حَرْفُ المَصْدَرِ يَقْتَضِي أنْ يَكُونَ الفِعْلُ بَعْدَهُ في تَأْوِيلِ المَصْدَرِ, فالمَصْدَرُ المُنْسَبِكُ مِن أنْ وفِعْلِها إمّا أنْ يُجْعَلَ مَجْرُورًا With an estimated rhetoric before it is appropriate to comment, we do not fight with the news, and appreciation: what we have in that we do not fight any of our fighting, or what we have, that we do not fight The meaning of the words will be their denials that they prove to them because they carry them on the blessing of the fighting, or the reason for the sake of the fighting of the fighting, that is, it is not for that.Either the proportional source is made by the guarantee of “Lana”: the replacement of a disgrace, and the estimation: what we have to leave the fighting.And like this system comes in five forms: the same as you do not believe in Joseph [Yusuf: 11] and what I do For you and the expulsion around a successful one, so what you have in the hypocrites are two categories [Women: 88], and it is more than that it is after the interrogation in the place of the situation, and the one who does not Unit.“ And a sentence that we do not fight a state and it is a restriction for the denial: that is, we do not prove anything in the case that we leave the fighting.This is as his regulations in your saying: I do not do or what I do, because a source is a boredom with a deleted rivalry that is omitted with a ritual It is for us.And a sentence and we have been brought out in a state of treatment Denial: That is, in this case, people are far from leaving the fighting; Because the reasons for the love of life are weakening in the state of harm and the hardship of the exiles of the homes and children.The children are composed on the pilgrim because the perpetrators are called the distance of the thing from his life, and on his return from what he accompanies, and there is no need for the pretext of making the waw His estimation and distance from our children.And he said, when the fighting was written on them, etc.A senior sentence, which is the place of the lesson and the preaching to warn the Muslims from the case of these ones that they take over the fighting after the delay of them.And their children, and after that they wish to fight their enemies and may God be upon them and referring to what God has told about them after his saying, and for him, and for him, and for him, and for him.Etc.And his saying, and God is knowledgeable with the oppressors, is a sacrifice: because their action is from injustice; Because when they asked the fighting, they were imagined that they were loved for him, then they were loyal to him.And from the best of the discipline, the saying of the ritual: Whoever said, there is no need for a responsibility, then what is wrong.The children of Israel, because of the knowledge and the lesson, because the Qur’an comes with the remembrance of the historical tales, a teaching of the nation with the benefits of what is in the dawn, The people of the partnership, because it is close to the present that the Qur’an came to the Qur’an: this story is a sharpness that moves the government of the sons of the sons On the basis of them with the jurisprudence of the judges, to the royal dye, which is expressed by the touche of the mourners, and that is that when it is fulfilled by peace be upon him, in the end of the age of 1380, 1380 Al -Masihi, his successor in the Israeli nation, Yoshi ibn Nun, who was entrusted with Moses in the last of his life that he succeeded him, and when he became a matter of my children (P-488) for the tribes of the sons of Israel, they are asking them.They spent between them, and the judges called them, and they were in a multiple cities, and those of those sentences were a prophet, and there was a prophet of no rulers, and there was a ritual They followed what appears to them, and they were from their judiciary and their prophets, Samuil ibn al -Qanah, from the ritual of the Afiam, a judge of all the children of Israel, and he was He was old and greater, and a war between the sons of Israel and the Settisin was a debate between them, then it was the victory of the two sides.The coffin of the covenant, who will come to him, his family, the Settisin, and they went to him to the most severe of their country and remained in their hands.The Israel of what they had of defeat, thought that this is the weakness of the validity of the mobilization of their affairs, And they thought that the order of the two countries, was only the reason for the royal system, and they were a day, then they were signed by the stones of Naqash: the king of the uncle Esters and send their erasure from every city, and they asked for a fast to establish a king who fights with them in the path of God, so the sake of the fast of that, Saying: The king takes your children to his servants and the servants of his horses, and takes from you whoever runs before his carriers, and takes off from you, and he will be wandered to you His war, and the consequences of his trips, make your daughters fun and bakery and bakery, and choose from your rights, your rituals, and your afflictions, their rewards, and give them to his servants, and give them to his servants, And he takes you servants, and if you cried after that in the face of your king, God does not respond to you, so they said: We must have a king that we will be like a way If the fighting is written for you, you will not fight, say, and we will not fight, etc.That was in the first century, before the Christ.And his saying and we have brought us out of our paths and our sons, it requires that the Settisin took some of the cities of the children The first fasting, and that they were families of their children, and they released their elders and their horses, and in the remembrance of the lame from the homes and the sons, the essence of the people, from the Muslims, the two of the Muslims Those who were brought up from Mecca, and separated them from them and between their women, and between them and their children, as he said, and what you do not fight in the path of God And the birth [Women: 75].
