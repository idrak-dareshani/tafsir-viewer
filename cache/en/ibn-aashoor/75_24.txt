The Quranic researcher (the faces of the day, a fresh day [the resurrection: 22] to its Lord, the eyes and the faces of the day, then a family that thinks that it will be done by the paradise of what is meant by (the day of the day) His remembrance was repeated like this, as a result of his saying (the human being says, then where is the storm [Resurrection: 10]) and the two times are returned.And the compensation for it is the inclusion: the day of the eyesight.The heroes are the faces of the people of happiness and the wings of the Basra and the faces of the people of the misery, and that is clear from both of the two sentences.From the Qur’an as his saying in the surah of Abbas (and the faces of the day that is a dust on which it is overwhelmed by the abode of those who are the disbelief of the immorality [Abs: 40]) Faith in God alone and the belief of His Messenger ﷺ and faith in what the Messenger came with ﷺ, and that the origin of the causes of misery is the risk of God and the Messenger of the Messenger.This surah is what is mentioned by that as saying (that is, the human being, that we will not collect his bones [Resurrection: 3]) (Woes) for the diversion and division, such as his saying (a partner in paradise and a partner in the pricing [Al -Shura: 7]) and the saying of the poet, which is one of the verses of the Book of Literature, nor the pride of the Al-Abbab in his explanation: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و و The poverty and the background are the righteous, the woven faces, the woven with the freshness - the opening of the noun and the silence of the opposite - which is the good of the face from the effect of the grace and the joy, He was happy, and that is said: fresh, fresh and fresh, and the wealth of the faces of the joy of its companions and their nakedness said that the Almighty said in the people of happiness ( Al -Naim [Al -Mutaffifin: 24] because what is obtained in the soul of the reactions, its effect appears.He looked in the sense: I mean in his eyesight an advertisement with the evil of those faces that they look at the side of God, the Almighty, a special look that does not share it with whom it is the one who is the one who is the one who will be With his exhaustion, it was fixed by the Qur’an, and the authentic news was supported by the Prophet.The Messenger of God, do we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?You are in their vision.”And in a narration “So you see it like that.Al -Bukhari narrated on the authority of Jerir bin Abdullah, who said: “We were a rich when the Prophet ﷺ when we looked at the moon at the night of the Badr, he said: You will see this as you are the lord of this.In his vision and maybe, he said, “You will see your Lord.” A Muslim narrated on the authority of Suhaib bin Sinan on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ He said, “If the people of Paradise enter the paradise, God says:“ You want something that is more than you?” Paradise enters us and escapes from the fire, he said: He will reveal the veil, and what they give something that I love for them from looking at their Lord." The significance of the verse is that the believers see their eyesight, a vision attached to the same as God, on the signs The intended is the vision of its majesty and the glow of its Jerusalem, which does not imagine its vision of the people of happiness.(P-354) This is attached to the adjectives, and if it is required, it is not the proof of a row, but it is interpreted to the adjective and its obligation is because it is the same, to the authority of the one, to the authority of the one, to the authority of the one, to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is to be a lord, And a fate that is surrounded by all or by each other, if the vision is visible, then it is not a crime that the promise is considered the vision of the people of Paradise, the Lord of the Almighty.And the scholars of Islam in that are different understanding, as the nation’s chest and its predecessor, they have run on their ways that they were created in it in the path The tribe is on its stalemate, and they were shown their attention from the depth in the groove of its truth and its perception, under one of the widespieces Some of it or a little of it, while they occupied themselves with them and did not seek detailing it, but they were scattered to what is more right to the integrity, which is the accusation and the residence Its authority, with the reward of God, may God bless him from the excess of the boundaries of the fools of these characteristics, make their imam, who is rejected to him in all of this (this is what he said Something [Shura: 11]), or what this is approached from the evidence of the promotion of the promotion of some of what the description was mentioned in it, the same as his saying (do not realize it (103) To our position, with their agreement that the science of science is separated by that, that does not praise the bond of faith, so when we follow in the scholars of Islam, they ask for the sake And the scientific research resorted to the deepening of the Qur’an and the rituals of its expressions and the characteristics of its rhetoric, and they did not see the way of the scourge of the sake The successor is because their way in science is a way that is erased, and it is the adequate of their task, and that compares that what happened in the division of the Islamic nation from the bee of the lifetime, The one who is from Islam and others and others With them to the lord and the depth of the acquisition of knowledge on a baptism that does not accept the earthquake, and to pay the likeness of the suspicious and the response The collection is among the inconsistencies of sayings, cane, and the establishment of every truth in its injustice, and that is with the interpretation that the requirement is required and supported by the evidence.So the groups of your questioning gathered to be used by those who are similar to those who are similar to their wings, and they are based on the succession of their oppressors, but they are not.Rather, they complete the seizure, and this sect is called the lineage for the closeness of its way from the way of the scourge in the interlocutors, and these groups are in a way Its origin is a separation, so they are the Hanaba, and the most prominent.(P-355) And among them are the people of the Sunnah who were before Al-Ash'ari, like the money and the people of the hadith who were held by the wickedness of what came with the righteousness.Excavation that it is reflected from its oppression in the direction of the busts.The people of the two people have gone through the same as the calamity and the analogy, so they attached to the first class.And among them is the difference of the counterparts in the success among the minds of the mental sciences and between what the words of the book and the Sunnah came with it, and these are the darkest, and the people.Their statements in the vision of the people of Paradise are their Lord, as a result of this state: the predecessor has proven it without searching, and the disgraced, and the one who has been done, And the appreciation of the omission of its assets, the severity of them, and they would like to see what they saw as a category and their language.And the poets are proven, and they are the same as a sign that benefits the piece and the saying of the dismissed, but they did not exaggerate that And what was brought in every part of the pilgrims, which was not safe from the direction of exhibits, a variety and opposition, and also what every group raised on his opponents, from the oppositions that were not a vou.Repeated or with the senders, so he was taken and answered.And he did not get fun and ended up to a limit.It is good for us to delegate its way to the knowledge of God, as well as others, who are similar to the affairs of the Creator.This is the meaning of the saying of our predecessor that it is a vision without how, and it is a word of a universal right, and if it is more disgraced from it.This is what is related to the verse of the verse on the vision of the people of Heaven, their Lord, and as for what is related to the origin of the permissibility of the vision of God, the Almighty has passed the saying of the saying I see [Al -A'raf: 143]) in Surah Al -Arf.And the boundary of his saying (to her Lord) is presented to his worker to the insulting of this strange giving and not to the one who is the one who is in the past.(P-356) and between (Nadra) And (view) is a close -up seen.And the appetite for the denial of his saying (the faces of the day of the day (the resurrection: 22)) is that she wants separation and division for his responsibility The day is easy), at the end of the poet: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ She is the faces of the people of misery.And I will be prepared (the day) to confirm to the fulfillment of the reminder of that day.And (Bassara): Like a one of the mastery of torment, and it is presented at the saying of the Almighty (then he took and broke the secret [Al -Muddathir: 22]) in Surah Al -Muddar.A sentence (you think that it will be done with it).And a chapter: a great shrewd, and he is an active deputy (he is doing it) and the verb did not associate with the mark of the insulting because it is not a feminine, and it is not a feminine.Between the verb and its purifier, and both of the two things are justified by the blessing of the mark of ethics.And an individuality (paradise) is the individuality of the spectrum, that is, a great type of shrewdness.The meaning: that they are certain that they will meet my goodness, and it will not be fed.
