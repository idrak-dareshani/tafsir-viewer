The researcher is the one who is one of the openings of this surah by the command of the saying to the purification of care after the verb of the saying, as you knew that, what you said: [Al -Kafron: 1].Therefore, there is an increase in this surah, which is that it has descended the words (Say) As he said: Say the Spirit from the command of my Lord [Al -Israa: 85], so the matter was of a verb (say) two of two.And Zamir (he) is the guarantee of the affairs to benefit the completion of the sentence after that, and if those who are heard, they asked him after it.It is permissible for him to be (he) as well as to the Lord in the question of the two participants when they said: We have your Lord.Among the scholars who promised a guarantee (he) in this surah is one of the names of God, the good, and it is a mystical way that it is required to be the one who is the good religion in the evil of the name (P-613) Ibn Arafa from him in his interpretation, and the pride mentioned that in the keys to the unseen, and it is necessary to mix between his words.And they have the saying of it: Say: God is one of them with three names for God, the high alerts, to be alerted him to three shrines.The first: the shrine of the two precedents, who are close to the actions of things from where they are, so they did not see what they have seen, and only God; Because he is the one who is for whom it is obligatory for his existence, so what is God has a mourner, so his saying (he) is a divorced reference.And when the one who refers to it was appointed, the divorced woman was disconnected to that appointed, so his saying (he) was a sign of these approaches to God, and they did not come to the point of God.Distinguished, it was a verbal (he) is sufficient in the total number of wells.The second place is the position of the companions of the right -wing right, so they witnessed the truth, and they witnessed the possibilities, and they got a lot in the muds.) Full benefit in their right, and they decided with it to a distinctive, so he was said to them, He is God.The third place is the position of the people of the north, and they are those who visit the multiplicity of the gods, and the horns of Falaz (one) with his saying: He is God for the sake of their heart.His name is the highness of the flag, which he started before the news is to be done to be a way that all his attributes are all of them when the conversation is between the two of them.And among the participants, this name is known to all Arabs, so his name is not a conflict in its presence, but they were describing it with the descriptions of it.As for (one), it is called (one).And the origin of the wow, the waw, and it is said: A limit is as it is said, the heart of the waw is a gambling on something other than a measure because it is a fool (with the difference of the heart, and the wow) The naps: as if my Rahm and the day remained with us with the generosity of the one who is insulted and the limit He felt a human being while he was singular from his catastrophe.It is a similar row like good, it is said: the same is the same as generosity, and the same is like joy.(P-614) and the form of the likeness that benefits the description of the description in its Sufism that it is subject to it.Because (one) is an active name that does not benefit the ability.(One), (one), and the descriptions of the manifestation of the extent of the subject, which is the subject of the unit, which means: uniqueness.This is the origin of its release and the abundance of it has become the entitlements of the memorial (one), the most famous that it is used as a name in the sense of a human being in the meaning We do not separate between one of his messengers [Al -Baqarah: 285] in the cow, and his saying: I do not share my Lord one [Cave: 38] in the cave, and so he rejoiced on One of the twenty, one of the tenths, and its femininity is one of the scholars who mixed between (one) and between (one) and he fell into your arms.So God described it as one of the meaning: that it is alienated with the truth that was observed in his name, the knowledge, which is the known divine Divine.And if God is said to be one, then what is meant is that one is not numerous, so whoever is not in God is not in God.And the fate of the two descriptions to the meaning of the denial of the partnership of it in his divinity.When I want in the breast of the mission to prove the full unit of God, he learned to all people and the heroes of the holy part of the evil and the description of God in this (and for the sake of this) (One); Because the likeness of the likeness of what can be brought to the meaning of the meaning of God Almighty to the minds of the people of the Arabic tongue shown.And Ibn Sina said in his interpretation of this surah: (one) indicates that it is one of the highest of all the faces and that there is no abundance of there, there is no way, there is no abundance The possibilities, the segments, and the chapters, nor a sense of sensation, which are the many of the outstanding parties, as well as in the material and the image, and the many of the sense By doing, as in the body, and that is included in his formation, his pursuit of heaven and chapter, material and image, symptoms, and the opponents, and the parts, and the meat, The full unit and the righteous, the right to the generosity of its face and the glory of the face, and the one who is similar to it, or equal to it.And his clarification: As for the one who is saying on what is under it by disorganization, and who does not divide his face in the first place, the guardian is what is from what is divided by the one who is divided by the one who is divided (P-615) A mental arrogance is a pronounced one who is divided by a division by a sense of strength by power and then by deeds, so there is one who is unusual to the one who is the same And that there is no abundance in his descriptions.I said: The Muslims understood this, so it was narrated that Bilal was tortured on Islam says: One is one.The slogan of the Muslims was a day: one is one.And the one who has the most of the researchers in the names of God is the Almighty that (one) is not attached to the good names; Because he did not want his remembrance in the hadith of Abu Hurairah at the time of Termahi, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “God has nine, and the name of the one who has a name.” He promised it and did not remember in it a description of one, and he mentioned one description, and on that, the Imam of the Harmin was in the book of guidance and the book of Lamaa and Al -Ghazali in the explanation of the name.Al -Fuhari said in his explanation on the authority of the evidence for the Imam of Al -Harimin at the remembrance of his name, the Exalted (Al -Wahid).He was mentioned in some of the narrations, so he did not collect between the two names in a name.Ibn Burajan al -Ashbili drew in the explanation of the names and Sheikh Muhammad ibn Muhammad al -Koumi (in the mim) Al -Tunsi, and the kindness of God is the arms in the dowry of Al -Nur.The good names are with his one name, and they said: One is the one where he is as confirming for him, as their enemy requires the names of nine and a sideline, and this is a good one, and this is a good one.It is necessary to limit the good names in the nine and the nine, but it is for the virtue of those who are the numbers in it.The meaning is that God is alienated with divinity, in which there is nothing of the mega ways, and this is the heroes of the evil that the people of the evil condemn it, and for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the evil, and for the one Malakiya and for the Eannoyeah at the Magi, and for the countless promise at the burial.His saying: God is one of his saying in the other verse, but God is one of the God [Women: 171], and this is the meaning that the addressees are perceived in this verse of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is perceived by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is perceived God, that is: his truth, (p-616), so he started to them that he is one to know that idols are not from divine in anything.Then the limit requires the existence, not the case, so the saying of the idle and the foresight.The scholars of the words were broken from the Sunnah of the Sunnah on the sake of the Rabbani negative attributes of the meaning of the limit; Because if he was alienated with divine, he was dispensed with the special affirmation; Because if he had become a lack of those who found him, whoever finds him a god of his first; So, God was present, unprecedented, with a number and no need for a devotion to the fences of the extent of the numbers, and he was seeking to supply, and he was a lump Other than him, and he was contrary to the analytics, otherwise he needed the same to the specialist, so he was attributed to (one) as a gathering of the lipstick.And like that, it is said in his synonyms, which is one description.واصْطَلَحُوا عَلى أنَّ أحَدِيَّةَ اللَّهِ أحَدِيَّةٌ واجِبَةٌ كامِلَةٌ, فاللَّهُ تَعالى واحِدٌ مِن جَمِيعِ الوُجُوهِ, وعَلى كُلِّ التَّقادِيرِ فَلَيْسَ لِكُنْهِ اللَّهِ كَثْرَةٌ أصْلًا لا كَثْرَةٌ Meaning, and it is the number of vessels of sexes and chapters from which the water is eager, nor the many parts of the parties in which the bodies are eager.And he stated (one) that it is a balance of gender, chapter, material, and image, symptoms, and lights, and the members, forms, colors, and aspects of what contradicts the full one, as he indicated.He said in the scout: In the reader of the Prophet ﷺ God is one of the things that he is uh, and perhaps he took it from what was narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Whoever reads (God is one).With the impact of the readers of Abi Badoun (Say), from what the good interpreted, as he said, and this is a martyrdom on this reader.And when it is true that it was narrated from the readings that the Prophet ﷺ did not intend to recite it, but rather the intended compliance when he was commanded to say, and this is what he was.My Lord, the Great, and praise be to God, forgive me.
