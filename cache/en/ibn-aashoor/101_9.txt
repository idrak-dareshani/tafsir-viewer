The Quranic researcher, whoever has the weight of his budgets [6], is in a satisfied life, and the one whose budget has hidden [8] his mother is an amateur [9] and what I know is what he is [10] His saying: On the day the people are like the butterflies, [Al -Qarbah: 4] from the wetness of the state of people at that time, then this is the intended of the remembrance of the name of the people of the people, So, his detailing was in two ways: a good condition and a foolish condition.And the weight of the budget is a way for his being in the place of contentment from God Almighty for the many good things; Because the weight of the balance is required, the weighing of the balance is required, but the desired things are weighing in their possession, and the Arabs were shown at the authority And the like, and against that they say: So that there is no weight for it, and the Almighty said: We do not evaluate them on the day of resurrection and adultery [the cave: 105], and Al -Nabahah said: That is, it is more likely, and this is replaced in the Arabic, so he was not explained in the verse by mentioning what the budgets are sacked to appear that it is good work.The reminiscent of the balance of the tanks was redeemed on the day of resurrection a lot in the Qur’an.Ibn al -Arabi said in the capitals: He did not want a authentic hadith in the balance.What is meant is a long time of bits, and God is able to make that day of resurrection with a prayer or by the work of angels or the rest of that.(P-514) and Live: the name of the source of the livelihood, like fear, a name for fear, that is: in life.The description of life with (satisfied) is a mental metaphor; Because the one who is satisfied with her is satisfied with her, and she was described by life because she caused satisfaction or the time of contentment.And his saying: His mother is an amateur, a news about him with the misfortune and bad situation.And an air: Halika, and the words are represented in the case of those whose budgets have hidden the day in the case of Halik in the world; Because the Arabs are about the state of the woman in the state of his mother in good and evil; Because of her son's love, she is more pleasant with his pleasure and more sadness with his grief.Arabi prayed behind an imam, and the imam read and God took the way of a caliph [Women: 125] So Al -Arabi said: I have read the eyes of the mother of Abraham, and from him the saying Al -Harith ibn Hammam Al -Shibani: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Like their saying: His mother was destroyed, in supplication, and from what is used to admire the supplication, the supplication is like a saying of the son of the son of the soul His mother has lost what the morning sends, and what does the night return when the heart of any: What is the sacrifice of the morning from it, and what the night returns when the affliction of it The two people are accustomed to the centuries of raising the morning and night, and the remembrance: Ghadi and the affairs, And (from) the estimated is a repetitive, for the words are likely: I met a lion from it.The compound who is said to be used to the state of destruction and bad destiny in the case similar to the state of destruction, and symbolized to the analogy of that compound, as well as the rituals.It is permissible for his (mother) to be a slogan for his headquarters and his destinies; Because he harbored him as the ritual harbor to his mother.And (an amateur) is the disturbing place between the two mountains, which if it falls in it a person or a bear.It is said that falling into the hallway.I want Hell with it, and it was said: It is a name for Hanim, meaning: Hell was nudity.(P-515) It is permissible for his mother to be on added deletion, meaning: the mother of his head, that is: that.I don’t know what it is, as it was presented.And Adam (Heh) is a good to (an amateur), so the first direction will be in the guerrilla, as it is a useful, as the host of the destiny and the description of a kallak, and what is meant by the name of Jahm Bin Malik Al -Makbat, the Revolution of the Wise Hell.On the third direction, it will be in (hell) as a use of the first face.And the distraction that caused the J (she) the silence, is this that is volatile for the sake of lowering the memorizers at the end of it There is an obligation, and some of it is good, and it is not necessary, and that is in every name or letters of the last of it.Exalted: As for whoever gives his book with his right [Al -Haqqa: 19], he says, “I will read his writers [Al -Haqqa: 19] in Surah Al -Haqiyah.And the readers are gathered, and they have proven the length of this distraction in the two states of stand and the connection, and he read a Hamza and a successor with the confirmation of distraction in standing and deleted it in the waters.And the sentence of a shining fire is a bayyan for a sentence and what we realize is what it is, and the meaning: it is a protective fire.This is from the deletion of the chain of transmission to the one who followed in his deletion, seeking the people of the language.And described (fire) with (a protector) from the righteous confirmation; Because the fire does not deviate from the fever, and describe it with it and described what is the meaning of the word (fire), so it was like the recipient of the exalted as the Almighty: the fire of God: * * * (P-516) (P-517) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Surah of Al-Takhl (The grave) uh.And it was called in the dungeon of the Qur’an and the greatest of the phrases (Surah Al -Takhir), as well as its curse, the symbolism in its university, and it is also an insult in the one With the Kyrwoman.It was called some of the Qur’an (Surah Al -Hak), as well as its virginity in the book of interpretation of his authenticity.It is an angel at the public.Ibn Attiyah said: It is an anchor I know it disagree.On the authority of Ibn Abbas, Al -Kalbi, and Mualfa: that she descended in a pride that took place between the sons of Abd al -Manaf and the sons of Islam in Islam, as it comes as a relative, and they were from the pupil Their ancestors are granted by Mecca.And in perfection: the choice is that it is a civilian.He said: It indicates what the son of Abi Hatim has taken out to him that she was descended in two of the supporters who were proud of, and Al -Bukhari was brought out by Abi Bin Kaab, that he said: The son of Adam is a valley from a gold, who loves to be for him and a debt, and he will not be filled with his mouth except dust, and God repents on those who repent.Abi said: We would see this from the Qur’an until we descended (the god of multiplication [reproduction: 1]) uh.The person who is inferred by this is that a supporter of the supporters and that the appearance of his saying: until it came down (the hell of the multiplication [reproduction: 1]), that it came down after that (they were after that The son of Adam is a valley.That is from the Qur’an until the wall of the multiplication and the Prophet showed them that they did not say it was not a Qur’an.(P-518), who appears from the suffering of the Surah and its feast and its feast is that it is an angel, and that the one who addresses it is a partner of the participants; Because what was mentioned in it is not met by Muslims.And because of its descent, as the one said that the one who is al -Ghawi and al -Ghawabi said about them, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas, that the sons of Abd al -Manaf and the sons of the Qur’an are from the Qur’an From which one is more than more, so the sons of Abd al -Manaf are the sons of the sons of the arrow of three verses; Because they were more than in the ignorance.And the son of Abu Hatim was brought out on the authority of Abi Burida Al -Jarim, who said: I came down in two of the supporters of the supporters: Bani Harethah, and the sons of Al -Harith, and they will be broken, and they said: The grave, so it made one of the two sects saying: In you, like that, it refers to the grave.And like that, and the other did like that, so God (God is the most multiplication [Takbath: 1]).The sixth was a tenth in the installation of the liquefy, and it came down after the wall of the caramel and before the wall of the one who is based on that it is an angel.And its number is eighty.* * * I was seen on the time of God for the view of the Qur’an and the call of Islam by exciting money, multiplying it with it, and being broken by the predecessors, and the one who is in the minds of the hearts.The grave as it became the one who was before them and on the end of that.And he urged them to be managed as he saved them from hell.And that they are close and responsible for the great skepticism of the blessed blessings.
