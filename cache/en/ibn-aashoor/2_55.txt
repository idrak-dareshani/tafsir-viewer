The researcher, when you said, Moses, we will not believe for you until we see God as a misery, so I took you the thunderbolt, and you look With the last bitterness, it was raised after a punishment for a sacrifice, so the place of the year and the grace is the saying of it, and then we will send it and what is accepted by it, and it is not.He was presented in his saying, and we prepared for four nights.[Al -Baqarah: 51] The verse.And those who say are the ancestors of the addressees, and that they said to Moses, we will not believe for you until we see God as a javer The calf is as it is the appearance of the pursuit of the verses.This is narrated from the bond, and it was said that that he asked him for his needs, and that the liquids are the seventh of those who are the one who is the seventh of those who are the one who is the seventh of those Expressing them in Al -Tawarah with a priesthood and the Chiouk of the children of Israel, and it was said that he asked a group of the general children Al -Tawarah is what is sweeping for the prejudice of one of the two sayings, nor is what is frank in the fall of this question, but the appearance of what is in the ambiguity of the trinity is what indicates that this is the rest After the words of God, the first to Moses, because she was reminded of Moses in the address of the children And the mediator of darkness and the mountains will take place with the fire, bringing to me all the presidents of your poles and your horses, and you said it is the Lord, our God, we have seen us, his glory, and the greatness of our soul......When we hear the voice of the Lord, we also die.......You are presented and heard everything that the Lord tells you, our God, and speak to us with everything that the Lord speaks to you, etc.He reached them with the amount of death, and after the Qur’an is a pilgrimage, otherwise it is true to what is between his hands and his concern for him.And it is clear that this was in the third month after their choice of Egypt.And the meaning is that we do not believe in you that they should be signed by the disbelievers, if God did not see the Almighty, that is, that they will be used in the future of their faith.They wanted the full faith, which is the view of the witness, that is, that one of these faith is fulfilled if God did not see a wicker, because we will not be exhausted, he said: And there will be a negation, it will do, and as your saying will be based, it is not necessary that it is not a standing standing, so it is not in the verse that indicates that they are disbelieved when they say this, and this is the saying Their experiences and the lack of their heritage with what they have gone from the blessings and what they witnessed from the miracles until they raised to see God as a phenomenon, and if they did not see their entry The suspicion is in the truth of Moses, and this is the saying of the one who said if so, I am a disbeliever.And there is no way in the Qur’an, nor in it, which indicates that they said that from disbelief.وإنَّما عَدّى نُؤْمِنُ بِاللّامِ لِتَضْمِينِهِ مَعْنى الإقْرارِ بِاللَّهِ ولَنْ نُقِرَّ لَكَ بِالصِّدْقِ والَّذِي دَلَّ عَلى هَذا الفِعْلِ المَحْذُوفِ هو اللّامُ وهي طَرِيقَةُ التَّضْمِينِ.(P-507) The flower is a source of weighing a verb from the wicked, which is the clear appearance, so it is used in the appearance of self and voices, real on the saying of the ritual.With an extension, either with the sensitivity of the eyesight, we saw it in spite of the wilderness, if it appears its water, or with the sensitivity of the hearing, the like, and if it is a man, and the words of the word The wicked is metaphor in the vision of its similarity, which is seen in the eyes in the way of the voice, which is seen by the heart with the fear, and the one who was the one who was in this way was in this All of it is a distance, as there is no evidence that the sound of the voice is the truth and there is no way to the claim of the insult in the flower of the voice until he says that the insults are from the signs of the righteousness Rather, the lesser metaphor is known to it.Because there is no joke in this sloping, nor a syntax that refers to the likeness of this likeness, because the appearance of the self is clear from the appearance of the votes.(Agency) was affected by the divorced verb for the two types of action, it is seen because the vision is what is a glimpse or with a brochure, so it is not clear.And the enemy is about to say an eye to his saying (a wicker) because a wicker is more correct for his hide, for it is not the beginning of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness I am tired of the throat of his fall in the middle of words and his peace from the letter The hearing and the Qur’an is the one that is highly in that, and it is in the end of the eloquence.And his saying, the thunderbolt took you, that is, a punishment for them, with what I seemed to be from the crime and the lack of heritage with miracles.This is a minimum, which does not indicate that the punishment for it is forbidden or disbelievers, and it may not be able to die with a thunder Distinctive and stubborn thunderbolt.And with him, he knows that he is not in the injury of the thunder That is that the thunderbolt is to be able to do them that it is an adult that resembles the bodies.Peace.And the thunderbolt is a fierce fire from the clouds that burn those who hit it, and the fire may not appear, but it will reach its passions to the life So they are eager to mix with the whims of the air in which they breathe from the severity of the severity of the intensity They died.(P-508) And his saying, and you are looking at [Al-Baqarah: 50] The situation indicated that the one who struck them from what is seen, and Al -Qaribbi said, that is, and you look at some of you to some of any community.And when you are the most likely you look at the deleted, and that you look at the sense of the eyes of the vision of the clouds on the mountain of the phase, for the sake of the phase of the time of God.They are used to that God speaks to Moses as a word that he hears from the clouds, as the delegation says it in the positions, so the case is the case that the wise man has befallen them in the time Shut up as it would not have been for them.And his saying, then we will send you after your death, a briefing, that is, you are from the thunder A response to his prayers and his reaction, or a generosity of them after their discipline, if the two who are seventy, then they are the good of the children of Israel.If you say: If the liquids are the righteous, then how are they?I said: I knew that this is a worldly punishment, while he attains the righteous and called the Sufis with the blame, and he does not contradict the dignity, and his counterpart is that Moses asked.So God walked to the mountains, so he made it a rack and mosquitoa was stunned.The resurrection after the day of the day of the creation was said: The death is the dignity of the movement of the heart, and it will be disturbed by the functions of the blood of the blood.Life except on the day of the restoration of creation, which is the meaning of its words, and they do not taste the death except the first death [smoke: 56] and if it gets an intercourse with a murmur, then it was forbidden to do the jobs The embodiment of the judgment of the death in that state, but it accepts the return if the causes of life are returned to him with the misfortunes Which disrupts the work of the heart, the death of the dead and the heart of the heart with surgical hopes that restore its movement.And the death in the threshold if it is from the eagerness or the power of the sound of the voice on the heart, the life of life may be followed by the communication of a pure, pure air, and this is the time of the time of the time Few; But this juvenile was a habit of usual, and their death could have been long on day and night, as it was narrated in some of the news, and it can be without that.
