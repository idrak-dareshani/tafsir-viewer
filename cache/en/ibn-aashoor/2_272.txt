The researcher of the Qur’an is guided by you, but God guides whoever is.It is an exile, which is supposed to say between it.Throughout them, it is categorized from people, including those who spend their money, the people of the people and do not believe in God or the other day, and among them are those who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones And among them are those who complete the penthouse from it, they spend, and among them are those who prepare them with poverty and command them with construction, and the existence of this is the one who is the same ﷺ So God followed that by silence the soul of His Messenger and those who have to be upon him that he is not guided by him, but the rhetoric is upon him.Their hearts, and the guidance in the sense of the tablig and the guidance, is the prophet, and this is a lot in the Qur’an.The most important of them are the partners and the opponents, and it was said that it was returned to the people who are known, and it was narrated that the names of the daughter of my father were the deceitful mother of the mother of a disbeliever and the one who is a disbeliever The case - that you see them in a full time, and that he wanted some of the charity supporters on their relatives and their nights in the sons of Al -Nadir and Quran, so it is forbidden (P -70) Checks on the infidels, coming to those infidels on the entry in Islam, so God Almighty revealed: there are no verses to them, that is, the guidance of the disbelievers, that is For those who are sincere, these are the infidels.The guarantee is a good knowledge of the addressee, so the revelation of the verse is for that reason arising from the descent of the verses of the matter with spending and charity, so the verse will be The reason for the descent of this verse.The meaning is that you have to guide them more than the supplication and guidance, without guiding them with deeds or abandonment, as there is no guidance for those who mislead God, and this is the same For Huda.And the discourse is in you, it is guided by it that it is a discourse for the Messenger on the first face, which we mentioned in the hostility The following in the guerrilla, if we are considered what they mentioned in the reason for the descent, that is, it is not for you, O hesitant in giving your closeness.And (Ali) in his saying: (upon you) for the salvation of the metaphor, that is, asking for action on the face of the obligatory.The meaning: that is not a duty on the Messenger, so it is not saddened by the number of their guidance, because it has performed and is required to repent, or the meaning: that is not for you, which is the duty of you For their Islam with the deprivation of spending until they can be guided by the way of dating.The custody is presented, which is “on you” on the chain of transmission to him, and he is “guided” if it is done on what is reported in the knowledge The right of delay is the right of the chain of transmission to the chain of transmission, and that was in the confidences, indicating that there is no dust on which we have the debt of your religion and the religion of the debt: She has earned and on it what she was gained [Al -Baqarah: 286] - So if it was signed in the context of the negation, it is not clear; Because if the adaptation is in the image of the confirmation, it is beneficial to the limit, then it is necessary that if it is denied, then the siege is denied, because the sentence is in the case of the case in the case of the case in the case of the case in the case A restriction that I attributed to the restriction of the blockade; That is, with the restriction of its imposition in the sense of its subordination, then if the negation enters it, it is necessary to deny the ratio of the restriction, that is, the denial of this The negation, if it goes into a restricted words to set up for that foot.(P -71) But the imams of art, when they mentioned an example of the bond of the supporter of the chain of transmission to it, have been in it among them - as it is mentioned - and not to mention it Galleh [Al -Saffat: 47] He was represented by him in the scouts when he said: “There is no doubt in it [Al -Baqarah: 2] So he said: He intended to precede the wine of the paradise, and he said: His explanation is that you are a shortened for the description; That is, the galaxy is short on the largest in the wine of paradise, which does not exceed it to the numbers of the arrival when it meets it, or the numbers of the ghoul are short on the fact that it does not come to it in it, in which it does not go to it.This is the coffee.And I have been transmitted with his words: there is no doubt in it [Al -Baqarah: 2] on this verse here, so we are explaining the way of the palace with the possibility in the nose, and it is that it is the one who was in the nose, and it is that it is Knowing the installation, and it was not a challenge to the one, where the negation is directed to it, and that was the entity of it, accompanied by the nose, so it is not.It is beneficial to the palace of the gauge of the denominations of the world, and the negation of the palace of the ghoul is not beneficial to the olive His saying has no doubt in it [Al -Baqarah: 2], when he said: In a sentence, the letter of negation makes a part or a letter from the forefathers of the chain of transmission or the chain of transmission to it.So he made the face that the custody was not presented in his saying: there is no doubt in it [Al -Baqarah: 2] as the disobedience was presented in his saying: there is no money in it [Al -Saffat: 47] That another book in which the Lord, not in the Qur’an, is not in a corruption.If this is decided, then he said: It is not for you if they are guided if this is taking place on this birth, it was his benefit: He guided them short on the time of it.It is the extent of his being, other than the addressee, that is, the heroes of his being on God, and both of the beneficiaries are not intended, as the first or the second is not held, and the one is the one who is the one who is: For the stagnation of the perpetrator as the day of the day of the dew in the saying of Al -Hariri: ؎ What is in it It is a defect only that the day of the dew is divided by my exile, as it was truly guided by the Messenger, who loved the matter of it From his saying, but God guides whoever is unjust, or if he is running on the dispute of the necessity of the phenomenon with the transcendence of the smiles, the house of those who believe in the faith in the faith in With the formation of God and the abandonment of the creature, so he paid their guidance to the numbers of the universe in the coming of the creature God, that is, delegated to him.“ The custody is the prayer, meaning whoever creates any: there is no extensive in the coming of those who did not God guides his guidance.And appreciation: but he guided them in the hand of God, and he guides whoever is, so if he wants to guide them, guided them.* * * And what you spend is for the best, let you be intended, and what you spend is only to abide by the face of God and what you spend from the best that will be fulfilled to you, and you do not oppress.It was composed on a sentence if they appear.What is better, and it is necessary for it to abound from it by rejecting everything that calls to leave it.And his saying: And what you spend is only a state of God, and it is a useful news in the sense of the matter, that is: the benefit of the rituals is that you are not.The face of God is not for the life of God, nor for the observance of a Muslim and a disbeliever, and this meaning is valid for all the meanings that are involved in the verse that is before it and it is like it The news was in the sense of the end, that is: they are not spent except to abubble the face of God, and this speech is a usual news in the request to intend to achieve and confirm, and for you, and for you He was built with it from a sentence: and what you spend from the best, so that it is yourselves and a sentence: and what you spend from the best of you will fulfill you.And his saying: And what you spend is the best that will be fulfilled to you, and you do not oppress the kindness of the one before it, because the part of the rituals of the rituals, and that it is from the one who is the one who is in the authority We missed it, and repeated the verb (you spend) three times in the verse for the increase in the virgin The mandate between spending and rewards, and he came to him once in the form of negation and discretion, because he intended the news in the sense of creation, that is: the forbidding of the one who is not fulfilled.(P-73) And you are presented, and you are “the actual news of the trusteeship and the increase in the alert that they do not oppress but rather oppress themselves.Rather, the rulings were made by the sentences It is taken from one of it, and it did not make a single sentence that is restricted by the restrictions of all the sentences, and it was restored to the spending in all of it in all of it.To take care of it, so that every sentence is independent with the shortcomings of the many suffering, so you will run the course of the proverbs and decrease the generations.I was taken from the last verses - on one of the interpretations - the charity is on the infidels, and the unbelievers who are mixed with the Muslim are the ones The covenant and the people of the dhimma and the neighbors, and the jurisprudence of Islam agreed on the permissibility of giving the charity of the virility to the disbelievers, and the rule of that is that the charity is from the abundance God, and we have commanded us with goodness to the animal.The jurisprudence agreed on the fact that the charity is the ritual - the zakat means - it is not given to the atonement, and the wisdom The Islamic university is taken with certain amounts, so it is the richness of the Muslims with the difference of what the woman gives to the kindness of the same for the sake of the ritual The charity of the innate, for the masses of the vocabulary, and Abu Hanifa, the right to the charity of the vigilance, so that it was permitted to give it to the infidels, Female was more like, because the feast of the Muslim is the Muslim, and perhaps he saw it as a sincere thanks to the ability to fast, so the perspective was in the state of the friend, not And the saying of the public is correct because it is the rivalry of the sufficiency of the Muslims of the Muslim on the day And this destiny does not appear in the unbeliever’s poor.
