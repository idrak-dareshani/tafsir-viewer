The Quranic researcher (P-319) has been written for you to fight, and it is a hatred for you, and perhaps you will hate something and it is better for you, and perhaps you will love anything, and it is evil for you The appropriateness is that the fighting is from the women who are in his saying, and from the likeness of those who have been left before you, the women and the harm are the ones who have been given.[Al -Baqarah: 214] Before us, the children of Israel have been assigned to the seizures of the Kananis with Moses, peace be upon him, and they were charged with fighting with Taltout, while he was with the dawood, The unjust from the people who were on the level of the land.And you have been written on you from the form of the obligatory, and you have been presented in the verse of the commandment, and the “no” in the fighting of the Sans, and the fighting only for the elders is a general public You have to fight the enemy of religion.And the discourse of the Muslims, and their enemies, the partners, because they are their immorality in the religion and the permission of the Messenger and the believers, for the ritual of the miserable is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the miserable of the misery of the The Prophet ﷺ was not permissible in the fighting at the beginning of the appearance of Islam.The verse of the principles of the principles of the congregation of Muslims came down to the saying of the Almighty and fought in the path of God who fight you [Al -Baqarah: 190] as you are presented.This verse was descended in the satelliteness of the authority of Abdullah ibn Jahsh as it comes, and that is in the month of the tenth of the migration, so the verse is in this way.The legislations and the organizers that were contained as his saying: The fast was written on you [Al -Baqarah: 183], and the penalty is written on you [Al -Baqarah: 178], and it was written upon you if you are.On the choice, it will be his saying: The fighting has been written for you in terms of judgment before the increase in his decree, and let him take from it to his saying: To create a duty of assassination in his affirmation, or create a nose for the duty of the fighting if this is the first verse that has come down in this sense, based on the saying For those who fight that they were wronged [Hajj: 39] then in the fighting and a number of it, and it is not obligatory for him.And his saying: It is a hatred for you, a situation that is permissible, and it is permissible to compare it with wow, and you have to make it a second sentence that is given to a sentence: This is when it was known to the addressees (P-320), it is certain that what is meant is from the news is necessary for the good.This is the way to say after this: God knows that you do not know.And the hatred is to be the sacrifice of the kaf: the hatred and the rituals of the nature of the thing, and the likeness of the hatred is open to the health The printing, and the conquest is its dedication and what comes to the human being on the one hand other than album His mother carried him as a kara and put him as a karah [Al -Ahqaf: 15], and it was not here, nor are you?Al -Aqili: I kneel his secrets, O Amr, and we will be gone to you with the scourge of the connection.On the authority of his saying after that, and perhaps you will hate something, which is the best for you, the new one Partial parties to hate something.The owner of the scouts may be brought to the bearing of the deceased in this verse and the other verse on the metaphor.Al -Tayebi and Al -Tafazani decided by what is in it, and it is a source, and the news is exaggerated in the ability It is accepted and arranged, and it was said: the kaer is a name for the deceased, like news.Festival is unpleasant to the soul, because it is between the fighting and between its inhabitants, his souls, his sleep, his dormitory, his family and his house, and his house, And expose it to the danger of perishing or the pain of the wounds, but it is in it to pay the humiliating of the men of the men and weaken them, and in the hadith, “Do not come to you.So be patient, ”which is a sign that the fighting is from the warnings that people do not like unless it is left to it, it leads to a great harm.Do not come (P-321), and it is known that the purchase of the printing does not contradict the expression of itself with the satisfaction that the most of the cost does not leave it.Then, if the verse is an expert on a legitimate legitimacy, it is possible that a sentence is a story that is a story for a fading condition, and that is in the days A trustworthy on them, and it was one of its rulings that one of them was established for the twenty of the two polytheists, and that is from the duties of their guidance, and for them to be.This will be the rest of this time to the time of this verse, so it is imperative that it be descended in the warden of the Hadibiyyah, and they were righteous, and they were righteous, Because they are a large number of lives, so it is a reminder of them that God knows their reconciliation, so he has been answered by the fighting when they were, and they were not.At a time when they loved the fighting, then he was deleted for the reverence of the shrine, and the intended is the hypocrisy to its saying and perhaps you will hate something and it is the best for you to be the same His hatred is better for them, as it was presented in the dialogue of Omar with the Messenger of God ﷺ, and with my father Bakr, and it is in the verse I love you, as the words are on the fighting, so the destination of the context: the fighting has been written for you and it is a hatred for you and you are forbidden from it and it is a love for you, and it is possible that you will be lost You love it, and it is evil for you, and if the verse is the creation of a legitimacy, then the proof is a supply when we go down the verse, then it will not be and want to be in the matter I appear when I was to give him the saying of his punishment: they ask you about the month of the forbidden in which he is fighting [Al -Baqarah: 217].He said it and perhaps you will hate something and it is better for you to distort it to the payment of the severity of the arrogance that is from his saying: He is the one who has been for you He was his deceased, so he was the mercy of God with his creation, not to write it on them, so he will be done with this to pay that.And a sentence and may God be given to a sentence that has been written for you, and a sentence, which is better for you: is a state of something on the authority Humanity to his Messenger and the believers, and if his pursuit of his richness is rich in Bayan and Al -Talil, because he commands it and he will be obeyed.But in the bias of the rule, it is reduced from the hardship of the cost, in which the Muslims will be redeemed by receiving the project, and it is humiliated, so he indicated that the ritual is not.The interests are used and the spoiler, and the ritualization of the nature does not take care of it, as it is distracted by the nature, in which it is in it, and it is possible for it, and it may love anything, The consequences and the ends, (P-322), the thing may be blatant delicious, but its composition is leading to destruction, and it may be a roller and in its formation.And the publication of the people of forgiveness for the punishment and the end of them, or their ignorance, so the bouquets were and its pregnancy from the scholars and the rule And the consequences.If you say: What is the ruling on making many things that are foolish, and a lot of harmful things, and there are many harmful things that are loved, and God has made the exalted, all of them, Its imprisonment, so the sponge of the soul is for the benefit of its choice and the harmful to the harmful, as well as the cost of the question of the righteousness and the righteous, which is the one who looks at the one who looks at the time Al -Ash'ari was separated for the sake of the beekeeping?I said: The wisdom of God Almighty built the world’s system on the existence of the beneficial, the harmful, the good, and the fabrication of self, adjectives, and events, and I eat for the human being The human being created by the two of the two things, and I see it as the ways of good and evil, as we came to him when he said: The people were one of the people.[Al -Baqarah: 213] The beneficial is more than harmful, and for the existence of harmful things, as God has made it a family to be the bearing of people on the followers of the benefactor as he said in it, in which there is no one.[Iron: 25], The system of this world has established the existence of the oppositions, and made the human aspiration to have a collection of all the characteristics of the benefit in it, in which it is from the end of the rituals from the end of the rituals.The rest of the righteous characteristics of it or gave it, and God made the blame less than the shortage to appear to appear in this world of this world, and the world of the mind, So the people were given, and they were buried, and they were beneficial, so the harmful, and the beneficiary decreased by what the people have earned, and they did.And as the full, virtuous self -timers became less than against it, the attributes of the Kamal became dear to the attribute, and its pride and breaths were surrounded by the difficulty of its attribution on the authority of the good And the troubles are, because if it was what the souls are coordinated with the ease of it, the people did not appear in it, and the paths of the kinship did not appear, and the competitors did not occur between the people.And the fact that the difficulties were broken to get it.(P-323) Then God Almighty has made the system of existence in this world by generating something between two things With the kindness of the well -known birth, he said, and from all of the fruits, he made two wives of two [Al -Raad: 3]).Two other rows of two opposites, which are drawn up in the same way, and they arise from their equivalent a third characteristic.And the virtue was made generated by the disclosure; The courage is from the visits and the cheese, and the generosity is from the sorcery and the scarcity, and there is no doubt that the one who is generated from two things is less than what is born of it, because it is less than that, because it is less than that Whenever the two classes are not found from them, a third adjective is born, but until the equivalent and the reward will be obtained between you, the two grades are the two rows.The crops, and there is no doubt that the scarcity of the scarfs ruled with a few bodies of the souls, the characteristics of the characteristics, and it was difficult for it to the few used to it.And that is, God has set for people a system for the accommodation of the beneficial and harmful things, while it was created for its sake, so the follower in the image of its entirety on the human being and this regime is on the human being A dedication to the paths of the creatures in the eternal world, the world of immortality, which is the last house, as it is said (the world is the treasure of the hereafter), and this is how the view is completed.Al -Sheikh Al -Ash'ari on his elders, the origin of them, in the way of righteousness and righteousness, so the search of Al -Ash'ari will be a resurrection, and our words are a bond and a conversion.And the sentence, and God knows that you do not know Shamwhala for all, and an active (know) and (you know), deleted, indicate what is before him, that is, and God knows the good, and you do not know, and you do not know, and you do not know, The things are what they are, and the people are affected by knowledge.What is meant by this is the knowledge of the Muslims who receive the command of God, to be able to do that it is good and good, and that what we did not show us from the one who is the one who has the right to do so.A description that is appropriate for the rule of the law in which we ask for the ability of the possibility that we will realize it, so that we can separate it and measure it and enter this Hope does not run his command and forbids him except for his knowledge.
