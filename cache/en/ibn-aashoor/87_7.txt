The Quranic researcher is your readers, so do not forget except what God wants, he knows the wickedness and what is hidden.You have known that the matter of praise is in his saying: Praise the name of your Lord, the highest [the highest: 1] with a central view of the prophet ﷺ with the best of it, so that it is the same, so it is so He promised him that he will protect him from the forgetfulness of what he reads, and he will notify him as he revealed to him and preserves him from the abandonment of it, and this is the one who will be Bianhi; Because the evil is established in the same prophet ﷺ, he was seized for a good promise that he brings, and preach it to increase it from the revelation, with what he said: His saying: Do not forget.And if this surah is one of the fences of the fence.And it was established in the correctness of Ibn Abbas, “The Prophet ﷺ was treated from the descending intensity if Jabril came down, and he was what he moved, and his lips, and his lips, and his lips, It is afraid that you will be wrapped in it, and he said to him: Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it, if we have all of us and his Qur’an [the resurrection: 16] that we have to do it Read it, then if we read it, then follow its Qur’an [the Resurrection: 18] he says: If he is revealed to you, then hear, he said: So if he came to Jabril, he will be brought up, then if he gave it, then he will come.As God promised him, “The Wall of the Resurrection from which you do not move with it for your tongue [Resurrection: 16] I came down after the surah of the highest With his help on all of what is revealed to him.“ Some of what I have been revealed to me when you said it, so he will follow and multiply, so he does not fear his forgetfulness, for he will be guaranteed for him.And the Sunnah is a mark on receiving its entry, and it benefits the affirmation of the verb, especially if it is associated with a verb that has the time of speaking, then it is that it is necessary And he will be sure of his crops, and if his saying is: We will read you, so do not forget to be read, for the Sun indicates that the sins are stretched and renewed.And the fools of the great speaking of the spoken; Because the spoke is attributed to the preaching.And the chain of narrators to God is a mental metaphor; Because he made the reader and commanded his readings.His saying: Do not forget a news that is intended by the promise and the guarantee of it with that.And the forgetfulness: the precedent of the preceding information in the preservation of the human being or long time.And the discretion in his saying: except what God wants to empty of the act of forgetting, and what is connected is the condemnation.And appreciation: except that God will forget him, then delete the verb of the will of the will running over the majority of his resignation in the words of the Arabs.And see what was presented in his saying: If God willing, he gone by hearing them and their eyesight [Al -Baqarah: 20] in Surah Al -Qar.What is meant by this is that some Qur’an forgets the Prophet ﷺ if God wants to forget it.And that is noun: one of them, and it is their appearance: that God, if he wants to copy the recitation of some of what was revealed to the Prophet ﷺ He commanded that he leaves his readers, then he will be left.That they do not read it until the Prophet forgets him ﷺ and the Muslims.This is like it was narrated from Omar that he said: “So the Sheikh and the Sheikh revealed if they adultery, and they will leave them.” Omar said: We have read it, and that he was not.If you are unbelieving that you will want your fathers.” This is what was referred to by the words of the Almighty: or we will forget it in the readers of those who read its forgetting in the cow surah.(P-281) The second type is what exposes its forgetfulness to the Prophet ﷺ a temporary forgotten, as well as the symptoms of the human preservation, then he will be given to God.In the authenticity of Al -Bukhari on the authority of Aisha, she said: “The prophet heard ﷺ a man who reads from the night with the mosque, and he said: God will be merciful, so I have been so mentioned I dropped them or I forgot her from Surah, such and that, “And in it, the Messenger of God ﷺ fell into a verse in his readers in the prayer, so I asked him, Abu Bin Kaab?He said: I forgot it.And his saying is: Do not forget the user of the forbidden from the forgetfulness; Because the forgetfulness does not enter under the action, but it is not in it, and it is a vicious one and its claim is an arousal to the release of the writers of the thousand.And the sentence is that he knows the wicked and does not hide the opposite, and it is an illusion of a sentence, so do not forget except what God wills The exhibited shortage.And the appropriateness of (the wicked and what is hidden) is that what the Messenger reads from the Qur’an is from the one before the wicked, so God knows it, and what he forgets, so he will drop it from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an, and he is from the Qur’an He disappeared in his preservation when the readers did not go to the heroic.
