Because the widow of the surah is between the two of the believers between the believers and the infidels in World and the last.And he started in this surah with the remembrance of the night, then the remembrance of the day, reflecting what is in the sun wall; Because this surah was descended before the sun of the sun with a period, which is the sixth of the light, and the days of the disbelievers were disappointed by the people, except for a few, and a little bit The manifestation is appropriate for that situation with a sign of its representation in the case of the night when the day after the day will be followed, and this is clear in the answer to the oath with the saying of it: He said: (If he wants [Al -Night: 11]).(P-379) And in his saying: (If your endeavor is a dispersal), a wreath that benefits the separation to detailing it by saying: (As for whoever is given [night: 5]) It can be detailed in the mind.And the act of action (fading) was deleted to download the act of the obligatory; Because the lesson is by cheating on all that his injustice is covered.The day was given to the righteousness, praising him with the enlightenment that every one sees and feels it until the inception.And the manifestation: the clarity, and the day is evacuated: the clarity of its light, so it is in the sense of its saying: (and the sun and its sacrifice [the sun: 1]) and its saying: (and the sacrifice [Al -Duha: 1]).It was indicated that the injustice of the night was overwhelmed by the day of the day and that the day will follow it, and the darkness is the origin of the conditions of the people of the earth and the whole of the universal system, After that, God created the sun, and for that the history was considered to start with the nights, then the history was drained from it.And the saying in the definition of the night with the kindness and the exposure of the day in the same way as the saying in its saying: (And day if it comes to it [the sun: 3] and the night if the sun is cheated on it [4] And (what) is in his saying: (And the male and the female created) is a source, and God has divided with the effect of the effects of His ability, which is the creation of the two husbands and what is required of the people.And the male and the female: it is the same as the types of animals.And what is meant: the creation of the human being and its formation of male and female as he said: (O people, we created you from the male and female [Al -Hujurat: 13]) because it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The one who perceives the most prominent of his rituals to repeat it on themselves is their remembrance and their female His condition is not counted as many of it.The meaning: that is the strange creation from the disagreement of the state of the male and the pollution with their choices from one origin, and the denunciation stops on their rituals, so they are stuck, so they are stuck, so they will be stuck, so they are stuck, so they are stuck, so they will be stuck, so they will be stuck The characteristics of divine verbs, which are an option that is not different in its evidence, but (P-380), the scholars of the fundamentals of religion differed as to the adjectives of the verbs of the attributes, so the characteristics of the attributes.With the presentation of the Matridi, or made it from the attachment of the capacity of the ability, it is a height of Al -Ash'ari, and it is a heal to the righteous dispute.The oath was in the sun of the sun with the level of the soul, that is: the creation of the mind and the knowledge in The human being, and the division is here, with the creation of the body of the human being and the disagreement of his two sects, and a sentence (your endeavor is a dispersal) the answer to the division.What is meant by affirming the oath is his saying: (And what his money enriches if he wants [night: 11]).And the pursuit of its right: the powerful walk, and it is wearing here for work and hardship.Written: The collection of a scatter on the weight of the act of a killing and my death, is a derived from the scat And the difference in the conditions, as in the saying of evil, evil: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The disagreement;
