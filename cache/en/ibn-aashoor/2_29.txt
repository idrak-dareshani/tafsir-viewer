The Quranic researcher (P-378) is the one who created for you what is in all the earth.And his nests are a phenomenon in the creation of man and in the creation of all of the earth, as it is a promise in the recipient of the many times.The chapter on the precedent sentence may be to take into account the observance of the connection between the two sentences, because this is like the result of the first evidence, because it is in the same way.As for that, for the goodness of the human being, as an affection for finding them referring to it by saying it and you were honest, so I will give you [Al -Baqarah: 28] because the extension of the creation is not the same In it, his peace is from the pain of the pilgrim to the pillars of its presence.It is permissible to be left of kindness to pay for the delusion of kindness that the evidence is the group of the two things.The first is a distance, and in the second, it is contrary to the original, because the origin of the chapter is that it is not a piece that it does not harm.Either his saying is that he was the one who created them with the blessings of the blessings to record that their traceable disbelief in the blessing is that it is in which it is in it.The earth is from the animal, the plant, and the repetition of what is a witness, as it was mentioned to it, and its saying is for you, so the chapter will be between the two sentences as well as.And it did not stop at the endowment of this sentence for the first sentence with the best because what was intended in it from the recipient was likely to reiterate the chapter.And the creation offered its interpretation when it is the Almighty saying, O people, worship your Lord who created you [Al -Baqarah: 21] and the land is a name for the world.Which the human being, the animal, the plant, and the hostility, are the three loyalists, and this is the ground is the existence The bodies of the three births, the creation is hung here in the land of what is contained in its advertisement from its appearances and its inner and it was not commented on the ground for the sake With the beginning of its creation, except that the immortal of the perceived is a new creation of disobedience, as the disobedience is intended for the sake of the perceived, and if the custodian was from the other than the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one.Either the disobedience is delayed from his dowry - and that is the contradiction of the perception and the testimony that denies that - or the custodian is presented and that is a mess.It is useful that he created the earth with a steady way, so it is far that the owner of the scouts is permissible to be intended to be intended to the land of the slope as the one who is the one who is the same Al-Alawiya, and its distance from (P-379) and Jahin: One of them is that the earth was not called a cat on the ground other than the metaphor except in the words of the saying The conquest in the search of the knowledge of the blame, and it was not attributed to him or his explanation: (People are the land of all the earth, and you are from their heaven) with the heaven of the heaven Everything that is more, and the difference between them is that the earth is something that is a witness, and the sky is only reasonable by its formation.The second is on the basis of the measure, for the sky was not called the high side until it is correct to release the earth on the lower side, but rather it is called the heavens on the heaven The same side.And the sentence is the one who created the form of a minor, and it is a true palace of the two who are the ones who are the ones who are not doubtful to those who are in them, and what is the one who is the one who is in them We descend the trend of the ignorant with that, and the defined news is for them because they are in their disbelief and their advantage of his thanks and the view in his call and his servants, and his servants are like his servants.God is the creator of all the struggles.And this is the saying of this one who creates as someone who does not create, do you not remember [Al -Nahl: 17] that those who call without God will not be created for the sake The participants did not prove to their idols a capacity for creation, but they made it as luxurious and wicked and worshiped and exposed to the worship of God, the truth of God.The adherent to them and what is around them from the life, and the intended of the words, as I see it as an agreement to the rhetoric of the remembrance that God is the creator of the earth and what is in it and what is in it and what is in it In the capacity of our interaction with it and what is in it in the different times of the homeland and the conditions, the words are briefly briefly briefly by the inclusion of its saying to you, so I sing about a complete sentence, so the words of the word The great power, the dignity of the greatness of the elderly, and the dignity of the great house of the human being with God Almighty.And all of those requires killing the infidels from their souls.And in this two verses: the first is that the reason was indicated that the creation of what is in the land was for the sake of the people, and in this this is an illusion of the creation and a bias of the phase So the issue of the reaction of God is raised and attached to it for purposes.And the question is different in which the speakers are different, it is similar to that it is rude, because all Muslims agreed that the actions of God are the one And a choice and on the authority of his knowledge, and that all of it is angry with wisdom and interest, and that this wisdom is the fruits of its acts of the height of the arrival of the verb of the verb.(P-380) It is obtained by the verb, the breasts of the ends, this is all there is no dispute in it.Rather, the dispute is that it describes its being, it is absent or not?So I have proven a group that was cursed by the rest of it, and I did not create heaven and humanity, except to worship [Al -Dhariyat: 56], and it is forbidden to do so The pride in interpretation is inferred That the one who does a metaphor is necessary to be a beneficiary of his abundance, that is the harm that this is the supply of the measure to me from the one who is from it.The first, and it is necessary to be the extent of that reason for its action to be, it is incomplete in its actor, in order to obtain the reason, and I may answer that the absence And the condemnation if you are the one who is returning to the perpetrator, and if you are back to others like charity, then no, then the pride turned it out that if the charity is more likely, it is more likely to be.Benefit.This response is invalid because the risk does not have to benefit ever, but rather it is obligatory to relate to the will, but it is necessary to benefit from if we claim.It is obtained that the evidence that they inferred to be covered by two subcontractors, the two sides of them, they said: If it was the verb for the sake of the abundance It is full of it, and this is a simplicity in which the excessive extent of the effect of the acid in the sense of the preacher to the verb, and the return to what is appropriate for it from the whole.The second is their saying: If the action is for a sauce, the exhibition is a reason that requires the reward of the actor, and this is a similarity in which the reason is in the sense of the motive in the sense of the reason Women and those whose numbers are numbers, both of which are called a reason.It is miracle that they accept that the actions of God are the Almighty, not to deviate from the fruit and wisdom, and they are forbidden to be that judgment and the purposes of the ruling that Everything that does not leave it is a suppression because it is a reason for the act of the harm that achieves the knowledge of the perpetrator and his will.And I did not know any embarrassment, they looked at it when they prevented the analogy of the actions of God, the Almighty and their purposes.It is suggested that it is the question that is required in the correspondence in the view, because the Ash'ari (P-381) when they were denied and the verb of the righteousness and the righteousness of the righteousness The disgraced or destroyed themselves in themselves is to be repeated that God Almighty does not do anything except for abuse and judgment and the purposes are only the purposes, so the good is not.It is entrusted with the purposes and is not expressed by the reason and it is reported that when they mentioned this question, they mentioned the charity for others.And there is another reason for the exposure of the question, which is the row on the authority of the actions of God, the Almighty, with what is illusions of the one who has been lost to him or for others, and they are not for him, and he is not.Other than that, the action of God will not be in the lineage.This, and Abu Ishaq Al -Shatby has transferred in the disputes about the jurisprudence of jurisprudence and the speakers that the rulings of God are exalted, threatened with interest, and the darkening of the words, Ibn Arafa in his interpretation He said: This is the reasoning of the actions of God, in which there is a disagreement, and as for its rulings, it is an ill.The second one: Take from his saying, he is the one who created for you what is in all the earth that the origin of the accusation of things is what is intended for him from the types of domains, which is the porn On its numbers, because he made what is in the earth, a creature for our sake, and he gave birth to us, and with that, Imam Al -Razi and Al -Baydawi and the owner of the scouts said to us Al -Shafi’i and Al -Hanafiyyah, among whom are the Kurchi and attributed to the Shafi’i.The money and the consequences of the Hanafis gave and the disgraced in the transmission of Ibn Arafa - that the origin is in the standing things and did not see the verse as a sign, and the son of the Arab said: God Almighty is the same in the presentation of the significance and an alert on the way of knowledge and ability and the inclusion of the creatures with the necessity of appreciation and the perception of knowledge.The truth is that the verse is a summary of which the alerts are destroyed by the Creator with the creation of what is in the land and that it was created for our sake, except that its creation for our sake is not the same What is meant from it, but created for us in the sentence, that the most sinful is true if each of the people has some of what is in the world, in the sense that the verse is mentioned that the verse is not the same One of each one, as the good, he referred to him, and God has addressed them with people who are disbelieving, denounced by their disbelief, so how do they know, but they are permissible, but it is permissible, but it is permissible, but it is permissible, but it is permissible, but it is permissible, but it is permissible, but it is forbidden.God created it from the things that people did not interact with them from multiple faces.A group went until the origin of the barriers and was transferred from some of the people of the hadith and some of the disgraceful, so the three sayings are disgraced as the Qatabi said.Al-Hamwi said in the explanation of the Book of Al-Ash'eh to Ibn Najim, which is transmitted from the Imam Al-Razi, but the thickness of the question appears in (P-382) the ruling of the things, the days of the days.While people committed it from the lusts and the like, and that was the most correct that the matter was standing and that there is no description of the things that arrange for it for the sake of the reward.And when this does not need the scholars to impose it, because the people of the deceased are not based on them, and their actions have no rulings, except in the duty of al -Tawahid when it is.As for the arrival of the legs, the richest of the law is from that, if there is a verb, there is no indication of a text or a measure or a source The prohibition and the benefits of the solution, and this is the one who was chosen by the imam in the crop, so the question of the question is a fruit by adopting this type of tunnels in Islam.* * * Then he went to the sky, so they settled seven heavens, and it is everything that is knowledgeable.For people - to the extent of the creation of what is greater than the creation of the earth, which is also, it may be overlooked by the view in the extent of it on the existence of God, and that is the creation of the heavens.This resignation will be a regret for entrusting people to the greatness of destiny.She turned up and then settled on a sentence of creation for you.And for the time, then the composition and the humiliation in the kindness of the individual on the individual, it was in the compassion of the sentence on the sentence of the ligament in the arrangement, and it is a least in the arrangement.It indicates that the conversation is then raised in the meaning that the sentence is covered by it, as if the mind is in the way of the ritual to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first Samel for that so that he does not overlook him with the hearing of the previous words, and this recipient was popular until it became like the truth, and that is called by the ritual of the ritual.By breaking the hamza - as the Almighty saying, then do not follow the punishment [Al -Balad: 11] and I do not realize what the obstacle [Al -Balad: 12] So he was a neck [Al -Balad: 13] a deleted beginner, and when the remembrance of this is the things that the righteousness of its right is the right of its right, which is forgiven by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is overwhelmed by one of the things of another matter By compassion, then to indicate that he is sure and important, and from the saying of Tarfah ibn al -Abd Yafif, his departure: It is (P-383) when it was mentioned of its merits as a sentence that was alerted to another description that is more important in the attributes of its neck, which is the length of its standing.Al -Marzouki said in the explanation of Hamasah in the explanation of the saying of Jaafar ibn Ulabah al -Harathi: “He does not reveal the clouds except the son of Harra ∗∗∗ He sees the thumbs of the death and then he is in the death of the death His affection for the individual is indicated by the crime, for it is in his kindness to the sentence on the sentence, so it is not like that, and he mentioned his saying, and then he was the one.And the benefit of the arrogance is the one who is considered to be in kind, then for the phrase, whether it is agreed with the good deeds with that, or if it was given in the way, and it came in the way, and it came in the word What indicates the sense of distance is intended from the distance in the arrangement, and if it is the opposite of the prestigious symptom The meaning of the action or the time, and its saying is the Almighty, with a walking with a bishop with a bishop [Al -Qalam: 11].13] So, it is a weighted as a precursor in the existence of the existence of his being, with a galing, with a bishop, because they are two self -classes, with the disagreement of a thunderbolt, His saying is the Almighty, for God is his loyalty, Gabriel, and the right of the believers and the angels after that back [Prohibition: 4] If you (then) to the arrogance of the arrogant, you will be carried on it, and if you bear it with the time of the Zemna, then it is the same It does not bear the time of the Zemna.But the permissibility of the two imams appears and that is where the conversation is delayed in the acquisition of what was before it, and it is with that, as in the house of Jaafar.I said, and it is either a metaphor or a serenity, if it was released and then I want from it to be the crudeness, which is the excessive dimension, as it is wanted to glorify the name of the name For the distance, and the relationship, even if it is a distance, it is for its months in their words and their accusations and with the readers, this recovery was not.And know that I followed this recovery in its positions, and I saw it more than what is mentioned in whether the sentence is a news about one of it, with one of it, if it is different from it, then if it is different from it, then if it is different from it, then if it is different from it, then if it is different from it.Then you seek the time of the adornment, as it is the Almighty saying, and when we take your covenant, do not regret your blood.[Al-Baqarah: 85] (P-384), that is, after we took the covenant with a time that you have been killed by yourself, and we said: I passed the kindness of the supporters, and then passed away.As for this verse, if the heavens are delayed, he created it from the creation of the earth, then for the arrogant cries, not a referral with the cries of the time, and if it was the same.Then the arrogant propeller is not unnamed.And the phenomenon is the second.And he has been seized between the scholars of the predecessor in the requirement of the news mentioned in the creation of the heavens and the earth, so the gathering of them said that they are Mujahid and Al -Hassan, and we are attributed to Ibn Abbas, if he created The heaven created his saying, and then he went to the sky and said it in Sura, the prostitute of the prostration.Fight to the sky while it is smoke [Chapter: 11] and said Qatada and Al -Saddi and a fight: If the sky created a advanced and begged by saying it is the Almighty to build it [27] His saying and the earth after that was given to it [Al -Naidat: 30] and it was answered that the earth was created first and then the sky was created and then the earth was given, so the one was elderly The earth’s land, on what the scholars of the lands of the earth went to, that the earth was in the end of the free and then took it until it was gone and was formed from it.She was stagnated, and she was stagnated, and sections were wrapped from them, and they were covered, except that the scholars of the lands of the land are appreciated by the crops of that Righteousness to the events of what is that the conversation is in a few years with a comparison of the tunnels that accelerate the mourning of the creatures with what is on it.And I like The two sayings is that the sky was created before the earth, because it was preserved after that, it appeared in the statement of delay from its saying, then it was equal to the sky, and that the heaven is not.A crime was separated from the sun, as the wiping of the Crusher from the sun system, and the appearance of the ambiguity of formation requires that the creation of the heavens is stable.And I count that your Qur’an in these verses is the tubes of the busts in this syntax for cutting the characteristics between the two companions of the two theories.And the sky, if I want the atmosphere that surrounds it with the ground of the ground, then it is a follower of it delayed from its creation.And if I want the high -ranking cries with it, and that is the appropriateness for his saying, so they settled seven heavens, so the makers are greater than the earth, so they will be the same.Each of the two impersonations may be observed in the positions of the Qur’an, other than the other in which the other impersonator is noticed.(P-385) The content is the origin of the righteousness and the numbers of Al-Awjaj, it is said that the path of a desired and so-and-so is so and so, and the thing is the one who has been overwhelmed by it, and it is called a metaphor to the one who is a metaphor to the one who is a metaphor to the one who is a metaphor to the one who is a metaphor to the one who is a metaphor to the one.With an intention and a speed, as if he is walking to him, a level that does not refer to anything, so he is prepared to be to the horns of the metaphor, and it is analog His successful will to find it a suspension that resembles the level of release to the great work.And weighing the level, I do because the Sunnah has an original letter, which is a metaphor, in which there is a sign of a sign that it started when the creatures created the creation of the heavens in it and whoever is in it.To create the earth, then create the human being, which was the story of the story for his sake.And (Sweeh), that is, their creation in a straightness, and the righteousness of creation is its system on the face of which there is no creation in it or a number.Between the level and the sacrifice of the guarded satellite.The heavens are derived from the heavens, which is the top, and the name of the heavens is called one and on the end of the high levels that are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the heavens of Hana, He said it, and they were settled by seven heavens, as he made it seven, and the guarantee in his saying, so they were ahead of the sky by adopting the will of the genius.The owner of the scout was permissible to be the one who is intended from the sky here, the face of the high, and if it is true, but it is not a reason for it as the balance said.And God has promised to be exalted in this verse and others of the heavens are seven and he knows about it and what is meant by it, except that the phenomenon that was indicated by the scholars of the sake is that the grace of the sake is that The great of the wakes of the path, with the earth, in the sun, and this is indicated by things: one of them: that the heavens were mentioned in the majority of the positions And its creation was mentioned here with the remembrance of the earth’s creation, and it was referred to that it is the mother like the land of the land, This is fixed for the surroundings.Second: It was mentioned with the land from where it is evidence of the sake of the manufacture of God Almighty, so it is appropriate for its interpretation to be those of the witnesses to the one who is the same The system of its path and its light of its light on the greatness of its creator.Third: She described the seventy and the scholars of the body were known to the seven cars of the covenant The Qur’an is what they disagreed with the seven.Its lord: that its cars are the plates that are connected to its path with a system that is connected with the system of the path of sun and the earth, and for that it is expressed by the scholars of the deity Shamsi, it is appropriate to be (P-386), which was created by the creation of the earth.And some of them interpret the heavens with the corridors, which is an interpretation that is not correct because the orbits are the methods that the cakes pursue in the space, and they are the lines of the one who is in the light.This is the highest of the heavens seventh here, and in a verse, and the throne and the chair were mentioned by what indicates that they are stained with the heavens and made the heavens in all the heavens.He supports what the scholars of the body are gone to, from the widows of the Circus for nine, and this is its names on the arrangement in its dimension from the ground: Nabat, the one, Mary, the sun, the flower, the perfume, the place.And the land in their clips is a cake, and in the terminology of the Qur’an, it is not considered with it because it is from which it looks at the frozen and the counseling of the moon, which is from the moon, and it is from it A dismissal of the earth is a close to the understanding of the Samaids.As for the constants, it is at the scholars of the body that is swimming in the vastness of the dimension of the earth and in that your doubts.Perhaps God did not make it heavens with a system such as the seventeen cars, so he did not prepare them in the heavens, or that God has prepared for us the heavens that are connected.And he said, and it is everything that is a result of the resental of the evidence that is not issued except from the knowledge, so this is the one who spoke to it: Foresting will.And the will is on the authority of science.And in it is an illusion of denial of their disbelief and the strangeness of it, for the knowledge of everything that ugliness to infidelity with it.This verse is indicative of the general knowledge of knowledge, and he said with that all of the millions as it was transmitted by the investigator in the Khazanian mission, and the flame of the flames, and the denial And they claimed that the knowledge of the parties does not fit the divine knowledge, and it is a delusion that does not call for it.(P-387) The public read EH (which is) in the original, and read it.And there are more than the annexation in their words, and that is with the waw, the loyalty, and the blame of the appetite, and its face is that the letters that are on one of the letters if they entered the word Part of it, so the word is a vigor in the entry of that letters in it, so it was reduced to the silence as they did that in the movement The Arab languages ​​are more correct, the housing of the distraction from (he) if he enters a letter that you find it in the poetry, so the house does not marry only the readings of the distraction, and there is no way to find it It is possible that it is harmful.
