The Quranic researcher is that the human being is to seek to see him asking for your Lord, I have seen the one who ends a servant if he prayed, a premature man Before him.And the (all) is a deterrent and the heroes, and not in the sentence before it, what the heroes and deterrence are required, so it is provided (all) in the first sentence, indicating that it is the same His saying is included: (I saw the one who ends a servant if he prayed) the verse.And the right of (all) to fall after the words of its abuse and the dirt on its content, and its fall here is at the beginning of the words, it requires that the meaning of the words that come with the following is the one who comes with the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes with He said, so the words are initiated by the ritual ritualization of the abuse, and from this tribe that the words open with a letter of negation, then it is not what is possible for it to be in.The Qais: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ - What do you find in prayer - between your appearance?It was said: Yes, and he said: The luminals and the condolences, when I saw it, do that, so I will give it to his neck.So the Messenger of God came as he prayed a claim to step on his neck, so what he sought from him except when he was thus he was overwhelmed by his homes and feared his hand.He said to him: What are you, O Abu Al -Hakam?He said: Between me and between him is a bench of fire, a wage and a wing.And the Messenger of God ﷺ said: If it was from me, the angels would have seized him.He said: So God is revealed, and we do not know in the hadith of Abu Hurairah or something that he reached (the human being will be overwhelmed) the verses uh.And after that I got down in my father, Jahl ibn Hasham, and that he said, while we were informed: It is an initiative with his saying: (I saw the one who ends a servant if he prayed).It is forbidden), etc.From what the remembrance of the prayer is used in it, and when it was narrated in the reason for its descent from the saying of my father, Jahl; Some of them: It descended after the first five verses of this surah, and another Qur’an came down between them, then these verses came down, so the command of God said: Other: This is not the first of the Qur’an.Humil from him Hadiths that the greeting came after we descended from the fifth verses of this surah and that first period that we mentioned in the first surah of the sacrifice, and there is a latter for this Ibn Ishaq mentioned it after he mentioned that the Qur’an was removed, and that is the permission of that it was obtained by the success of the fifth verses of the first, and the words of the first, but the words of them, but the words of them, but the words of them, but the words of them, but the words of them, but the words of them, but the words of them Fate.Al -Sahili said: The period was two years, and there is a distance.And let her neutralize its duration with the important thing, but the one who is concerned is that we are certain that the Prophet ﷺ was in the period Quran.Al -Sahili said in the ritual of the nose: Al -Harbi mentioned that the prayer was before the prostration, and it was a prayer before the sunsets (i.E.The era) and a prayer before it is the one who said: Bin Salam is like him, and he said: The prosecution was and the abuse of the five prayers before the migration with a year.The face is that the prayer that was prayed by the prophet was not praying, but it was a form that is not lost in a way that is in a way And approach [Al-Alaq: 19] (P-444) to perform it in the mosque, or otherwise, with a woman from the two polytheists, so he grew up on my father, ignorant and forbidden.The face is that these verses be to the rest of the surah, and it has come after a short joke from the first of the surah.The beginning of the revelation and the descent of the Qur’an, running on the fact that the origin in the verses in punishment in the readers is that it may be punished in the descent, unless it is proven to be delayed, and it is delayed by the delay.On the correct one, which does not want the tattoos to its disagreement, that this surah is the first surah that came down.So the fall of his saying: The human being is to seek that he saw him, seeking the signed of the submitted, because he returns after his saying: I saw the one who does not say to him: It is obedient [Al -Alaq: 19]; Because its admin is a comprehensive word for the guarantees, I saw the one who ends a servant if he prayed to his saying: let his club let him call [Al -Alaq: 17].The meaning: that what Abu Jahl said is arising from his tyrants by the causes of his richness as the human being.And manifestation in the human being for the tongue, that is: it is a person who is eliminated if he feels from his self -exploiting himself, and the imam is useful for the exodus, that is: His deity is his creation or his religion.And the assertion of the news of the perception of affirmation and the blame of the appetite for the purpose of the increase in its investigation of its westernism, as if it is what he signed.And tyrants: greed and arrogance.And the exploitation: the severity of the wealth, for the Sun and the time in it for the sake of the vineyard in the verb, the same as being walked and stable.And that his opinion is attached to the deletion of the imam; Because the neighbor’s deletion is with a lot and a great; And appreciation: that The human being to seek his own self -seeking.And the cause of this creation is that the exploitation is the same as its own.The delusion is raised in itself until it becomes a creation, where it does not dismiss it from a religion or a correct thinking; He will be overwhelmed by people to feel that he is not afraid of their feelings; Because he has what he is pushed by the feast of the nation of weapons, servants, agents, forgiveness, and benefiting from his partners, workers, and procedures, and he is in his glory.This verse has indicated a great psychological fact of the moral and the science of the soul, and warned of the warning of its way in the breath.The two guarantees are not gathered by the opposite: one of them is active, and the other is effective in the words of the Arabs, unless the worker is a matter of thinking and her sisters as in the verse.And from it the saying of the Almighty: He said: I saw you, this who honored me [Al -Israa: 62] in Sura Al -Asra.Al -Farah said: The Arabs are offering the soul from this gender (that is, the sex of the actions of the thought and the calculation) says: I saw me and calculated me, and when you see you outside, and when you think.Al -Basri (Ra'a) was attached to the (opinion) of the heart of a lot of grammarians, as in the saying of Qatiri ibn al -Fajaa: Once, in front of me, and from the one who said the saying of the Numar ibn Tulab: After the gossip.Ibn Mujahid narrated on the authority of Qanbul that he had read it on the authority of Ibn Katheer (he saw him) with a thousand years after the gossip, Ibn Mujahid said: This is a mistake.And the words of Ibn Mujahid are not tired after he was rewarded that he narrated it from Qanbul, but this was not seen by the son of Mujahid from the authority of Qanbul.And the right of this verb: the verb, and the verb of a number, if it is used in the supplication, we have said the saying: So you lost me and my number.(P-446) The sentence is that to your Lord, who is subjected to the presenter, the intention, and the discourse of the Prophet ﷺ, that is: the reference of the tyrant to God, and this is a prestige Exposing to someone who hears it from tyrants, and teaching the prophet ﷺ and installed for him, that is: the tyrants of the tyrant will not be sad for you Hell was observant [the Prophet: 21] for the tyrants of Mab [the Prophet: 22] and it is a preaching for the tyrant that his wealth is not deposited from the dead, and the death is: You are a toil to your Lord as a toilet, so he will meet him [the split: 6].And in it is another meaning, which is that his exploitation is not my right; Because he is a lack of God in the most important things of his affairs and does not know what his Lord is directing to him from the consequences, so he does not increase it with a good richness in this life, so it will be It is used in his metaphor, and it is the need for the recruitment to it, and the assertion of the news is (that) is taking into account in the sense of expression; Because the greatest tyrants are attributed to this fact, where they are descended from the home of those who deny it.And Al -Raja’i: With the sake of the shore of the export, it was returned to a heaven, like the bush.And give to your Lord for the return to the fulfillment of that.And a sentence that you saw who ends a servant if he prayed to the end of it is the intended of the deterrent, which was reported by the letter of both; This sentence is insignificant, and a premature manner, connected to the nose of a sentence, that the human being is overwhelmed.And whoever agreed on that he wanted the father of ignorance, as he said a saying that he wants to forbid the prophet ﷺ to pray in the mosque, and he said in Nad.He prayed in the Kaaba to be on his neck.He wanted to say that to be informed of the prophet ﷺ, so it is a threw that includes the forbidden to pray in the mosque.He did not see that he was his end.And (you saw) a word that is surprising from one case, it is said to the one who knows that he saw a strange condition.The vision is scientific; That is: I know the one who ends a servant and the one who is understood from him is that knowledge, and the second verb is for (you saw) a deleted man who has said that he said in the last [Al -Alaq: 14].(P-447) The interrogation is used to like; Because the wondrous situation is that it is understood from its argument, it is an understanding and the confirmation of its innocence; He hardly believed it; So the accusation of the arrogant in the miracle is a metaphor sent in the installation.And the coming of the questioning in the strangeness is a lot, so is you coming to the hadith of Al -Ghaffiya [Al -Ghashiyyah: 1].And the vision is scientific, and the meaning: it is impressed with what you get from science, he said who is forbidden by a servant if he prayed.It is permissible for the vision to be visible because it is a story that is located in the outside.And the speech is in the opinion of a specific change.And what is meant by the prophetic servant ﷺ.And the release of the servant here in one sense of God, that is: a person, as in his words, the Almighty: We sent to you the servants of us, the first of the righteous.And he adjusted to express it by adding the speech; Because the strangeness of the same thing is to pray by cutting the view of the chapter of the worshiper.So, it is forbidden to forbid it from the prayer of the Prophet ﷺ and fall, and the formula of harming in his saying: It is forbidden to bring the wondrous situation, otherwise it is forbidden.It is forbidden for him to be deleted from which he will be suspended from the verb with a verb that is forbidden, meaning: he forbids his prayers.
