The researcher, the Wip, who believed and did the righteous, that they have gardens that run under the rivers in the scouts: from his habit, he is glorified and exalted in his writers to remember the ritual.Al -Bashara intercede with the warning the will to spread to the acquisition of what is wrong and the discharge from the actions of what is damaged, so when the infidels are mentioned and their signs and their sins with their bonds with the custody of His worshipers who gathered between believing and righteous.And he made a sentence (and human beings) to be given to the entirety of the completed sentence for the two descriptions of the disbelievers.To his saying, it was prepared for the disbelievers [Al -Baqarah: 24], so a group of news was given to the reward of the believers on the group of news about the punishment of the disbelievers, To the comprehensiveness of the group on the group, and it is not a kind of a certain sentence on a specific sentence, which is required with the appropriateness between the sentences, and the one who is in the righteousness, We look at it with your saying: a further punishing the tie and tiredness and good age with pardon and release.The Grajian master of this kind of kindness made the title of the story of the story on the story, because the kind is not a sentence on a sentence, but rather a group of a sect, but a group of a sect, but a group of a sect, And his counterpart in the paradoxes is what was said: The first waw and the third waw in his saying is the highest, he is the first, the last, the most vicious, and the inner [Al -Hadid: 3] is not like the one who is the same.From them to benefit the collection between the two correspondents, and the second is the second of the two grades, the two righteous, the two who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The two meetings before it, even if the compassion of the apparent was considered to be one of the two precedents (P-351), there was no right.This is the one who has it, and he wants that the waw is a sentence with a beginner, deleted and experts on a sentence with a principle, and they are informed, and he told him, What is meant is that the beginning in it is estimated to enrich the letter of kindness from it, but it is deleted for the estate or the appropriateness in the kindness of the sentence of the one who is the one who is the one.They are two opposite lines that have been established for one of the one who has been proven by two other two lines.The master said: And the owner of the key did not remember the compassion of the story of the story.The sentence is on the sentence, and that the advanced news is included in the meaning of the students or by contrast The heights of understanding, so he understood the end of the religion from the words of the scouts, and he called it in his prolonged explanation.The owner of the scout was permissible to be his saying: (Bushra) is given to his saying: (Fear), which is the condition of the condition, so the ruling of the answer also has the ruling of the answer, and that is because the condition is (so) For them, because if they cushioned about the opposition, then the truth of the Prophet appeared, then the right of the fire is the right to warn, and it is the warning to those who are on his disbelief and the right to the evil.Rather, it was the one who is given to the answer, contrary to it, because the verse was given a speech for the disbelievers on the tongue of the Prophet, so when I want the warning of the warning, the warning of God and the good The answer is a discourse for them, because they are starting with their speech, and a speech to the Prophet to address the believers, as the believers are not mentioned in this.They only send them to them.(P-352) This direction was weakened by the fact that the scholars of the grammar have decided to abstain from the kindness of a matter that is addressed to a matter that is addressed, unless it is associated with the ritual of the ritual This is not a call in it.The owner of the key was permissible that (Bashir) is kind to “say” estimated before you, O people His saying was prepared for the disbelievers [Al -Baqarah: 24], so I warn those who disbelieve.And all of that costs are not a reason for it except the ease when the words of the grammarians appeared, with the fact that the owner of the scouts did not care about it.It indicates the abuse of the addressees, and the call is a warning from the century.He wants that everything that refers to what is meant by speech is sufficient, but the grammarians are the call because it appears as a verse, and the disbursement of the two things here is with the flag of the gathering, and the gathering of the gathering It was hoping in the premature camels that met what is in the premature camel, so the dirt of the warning that is in his saying, so fear the fire [Al -Baqarah: 24] The partners who believed, and the (fire) of Paradise, so that three classes were obtained.And the tuberculosis of the loved one, so it is more special than the news.And some scholars restricted the meaning of the tuberculosis that the informant - with conquest - is not a scholar of that news, and the truth is that it is sufficient for the dignity The informant - with the conquest - is that the expert - with the fracture - is not obligated by the search for the knowledge of the addressee, then if the news is fulfilled, then the speaker is not correct The news is in the obligatory or its stake.And the righteous collection is a righteous, and it is the good deed, and it is originally a row that has gone the course of the names because they say righteousness and goodness and do not appreciate the mourning of the one who said: How is the spelling and the righteousness of the family of a mother with the appearance of the unseen, we brought us, as if that is The face of its ethnicity to transfer from the description of the name, and the awareness is here for the suddenness, and it is an exploration of a well -being that is determined by its destiny with the abundance of the abundance, the abundance, the abundance, the abundance, the abundance, the abundance, the abundance, the etiquette, the etiquette, the severity, the severity, the severity of the etiquet The legitimacy is the same as the unseenism of the lipids, the listening is forgiven, so it makes it like a nomad.If you say why did he not say: and do the righteous with the individuals, then they said that the expulsion of the individual is more interested in the darkening of the group.The scouts in this position (P-353) of its interpretation, when he said if the mother of the sword enters the individual, it was good because the gender is intended for it to be surrounded by it and that it is for it to be surrounded by it.The one is from it, and if it enters the group, it is reconciled to it all the gender and that it is intended for it, not to one of it.So the conquest of the key, and the scholars transmitted it, and they did not separate it.Perhaps a questioner asks about the face of the Arabs with the group after the “exploiter” if the individual is a singer who sang it, then say: “The“ Al -Mudarfa ” For the life, he intends for him, and for him, all of his individuals, who have no decisions, are unlike him, so if they want to seek alienation, they look at them Dahir from the memorizers or a context that is the same as the human being in a loss [Al -Asr: 2] except those who believe [poets: 227] and you believe in all of him [Al -Imran: 119] With the form of the individual because it is the most lighter, and if they saw the vertebrae of the exodus hidden or the facts, they were fair to the form of the collection of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the formula, not One.And when the purpose of the covenant was not directed to a number of individuals, it is very important that its definition to seek the like, and God loves the good people: On a special improved, we are the same as its saying and that God does not guide the deceased of the traitorous [Yusuf: 52] so that it is not deluded that the hadith is about a traitor who means that it is so Citizens are a vertebrae on the purpose of the darkening.(Al -Saliha) affected the verb with it to (work) on the known of the words of the Arab imams.Ibn Hicham was claimed in the sixth chapter of the sinful singer that the verb is the verb if it is only found with the existence of his deeds, it was a reactionary, and it is not a verb, and it is not done.The righteous is a divorced, absolute and like the creation of God, the heavens [the spider: 44] as well, and it was used for that that the son of the eyebrow is in the explanation of the separated.It is a sentence like: Zaid Omar said.And the words of Ibn Hicham were a mistake, and the words of Ibn Al -Hajib are like him, and Ibn Hicham himself was rejected.It is correct that the relevant act is the source of its action or what its in its places.Heaven is a group of paradise, and paradise in the original is a verb of heaven if He will be seen, they transferred it to the place whose trees were multiplied and the thirst of themselves until some of its shadow, and that is one of the means of the blessing and the aroma of the heart of the A country that is overlooked by the countries of the Arabs, said the high and the gardens of the shame [The Prophet: 16] (P-354) and the righteousness of his righteousness is a speedy speed in the walk, and the water is made, A dirty, improper, and well -known water, and the best water was not a neighbor, because it is a new, so that a young man or a mobilization is broken from it.The rivers are a crowd with the opening of the distraction and its silence, the conquest is more correct, and the river is the one who is running in which water is on the ground, and it is derived from the substance It is great and young.And the whole of the gardens is completed by the waters of the water through it, and that is something that all human beings are all that it is from the soul of the views, because in the water, the patience Late.And the love of this is filed in the soul, so that God is the highest of the righteous in the paradise on the part of what their souls have fulfilled in this world, so the world is for the sake And the signs of its mourning on this world - the world of material - it has acquired knowledge and idols that did not go to it and prepare it for the end of the semen, and therefore it is good for you to God.The pictures, or because God Almighty loved to the souls of the worlds in the world because it is on the part of what he wrapped in the high floor before we descended to the people of you Example, and because of its alienation from the eclipse of the burning and the bright delicacy of its effects in its words in its mouth.The first face that appeared to me is stronger in the inclusion of the coming of the pleasure of paradise on the pictures of the sacrifices known in the world, and we will benefit from that of the saying It is similar and meaning (from under it) from the bottom and the guarantee is a source of the gardens with the adoption of its entire group, which is denied by the trees and the land in it, and it is permissible to the guns of the By administering trees because they are the most important thing in the gardens, and this restriction is for the revelation of the revelation, because the rivers only be like that, and this restriction is beneficial to the state of the state Paradise as a saying as a coff of Bin Zuhair: I was guessed with a youth from the water of the water.The owner of the scout was found to bring it to the inclusion of the rivers and its violations of the denial of paradise, either by that he wants to learn the gender, so it is like the denial, or that it is the denial, or that it is the denial, or that it is the denial, or that it is the denial, or that it is the denial, or that it is the denial, However, it is an estimated covenant because the gardens, when they were mentioned, were brought to the smallest of them for their palace and comparisons, formed for the word to speak to (P-35).(P-35) The bodies are surprised by the blame, and this is the meaning of its saying or the intended itself, so it is compensated by the definition of the imam from the definition of In addition, he wants to speak in the same way as this In appreciation, and the second one to benefit from the cost of the addition and alert it to the fact that the rivers are a new independent, that it will not be the ritual of it.He wants to have a compensation for the addition of the grace of the kufa because he had his father in the interpretation of his saying, so that hell is the shelter: [39] Two punishments here, and that is good in every place, that I see the knowledge of the Kufi as an acceptance and that they did not want only to the one who has the meaning of that To him is the one who made the additive as the mute, and it was entered on the mother of the covenant.And when the preacher to the definition is the arts, so that the denial is not repeated again, so it is a violation of them in the memorizer, convincingly of the wall of the definition.And his saying from under it appears that it is a detector that is intended from it, the increase in the state of the richness To fly the situation to the integrity of the desire, and this is from the purposes of the abolition, as the vigor is not insisted on the alienation of the understanding, and the proximity of this is the saying of this The horse of the friend and his dogs.؎ Whoever feels the tiredness of a shepherd ∗∗∗ as if it was the lower wealth of wealth and the name of the side of the lower place, which is against the highest.And for every place of high and lower, and that is not required to be added to what was added to the time Farnan, and this rivers runs out of me.* * * (P-356) His Excellency said: Whenever they were gave them from a livelihood, they said this, who was blessed before and came to him, and they have more purified spouses in them, and they are more purified, and they are the most vocabulary of them Whenever they are, it is permissible to be a second characteristic of (gardens), and it is permissible to be a news of the beginning of a deleted, and it is the guarantee of those who believe in the whole The excess of it is a thing that is one of the affairs of those who believed, and for the completion of communication between it and between the sentence that they have gardens that were separated from it as the one who separated.And whenever a time was disgraced because "every" added "what" the export is the export, then it was the way of the gravity of the restriction of the source of what is the source of the source and the grace of the The condition, for that, the condition is not only to be attached to the costumes, restricting the meaning of the condition of the condition, and therefore it came out to many of the words of the word Constitated to what [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
