The researcher, when his Lord, his Lord was afflicted with words, so they came to him, he said that I made you for people as an imam who said, and from my offspring, he said: The covenant of the unjust is not the same The two writers and the Arabs of the Arabs in the deportation of their misfortunes with their symptoms of Islam, and show their misfortunes that are without the reason for the guidance of his guidance That is on the leadership of the stubbornness, I mean the Jews, by expressing it, O sons of Israel, two times.Some of them who recite the book are the right to recite it, he transmitted to its struggle, and the remembrance of the Arabs who claim that they are better than the offspring With his fullness, and that they had planted a reputation and the bond of the house, which was built, and they were stored by the guarantor of the exposure in the vicinity of the angels, which was running with the family of the book of the family They are from the envy of the Prophet and the Muslims about what was revealed to them for the best, and from their saying: They are not Muslims on anything, and from the saying They say: If God will not speak to us.When the Jews and the Christians took them from the warning and complete preaching, as they took it, and took with the two participants, so that they would have been taken away from that, while they were committed to it.The Arabs of the Arabs to give them their luck from the complete sermon in (P-700), take it into it, so the occasion of the remembrance of the virtue of his premium and his homes is his For the punishment of the remembrance of the states of the children of Israel, it is the union in the intention, for the intended is the reminder of the children The Islamic preachers will be delivered, the preacher, the vulnerability, and the blessing of the worldly fortunes of the end of the other happiness.The intended one is the mention of the story of Abraham, the preaching of the participants, and the sons of Israel are followed by him, because the Arabs are more disturbed by Abraham, who is more To them, they are the memorization of his sanctity, and they are valid for the Hanafi, and a debt that violates the Hanafi violates them.It is true that we make his saying, “And when he was afflicted”, he was kind to his saying, and when your Lord said to the angels, I am in the land of the earth, as it is a good way.[Al -Baqarah: 30] On the part of the reminder of the memory of the creation of Adam with his saying, and when your Lord said to the angels, I am making in the land a successor [Al -Baqarah: 30], for the first is the first of the good.The success of the admiration for the disbelief of those who are involved in the creature in his saying, how do you disbelieve in God and you were honest, so I will protect you [Al -Baqarah: 28] and then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same He disbelieves in the verses of God from the offspring [Al -Baqarah: 38] The verse, then he was special among the offspring of Adam, the children of the brooms of those who have become a pledge to them on the tongue of Moses, the covenant of faith and the truth of the Messenger With them, because they became the domesticity of the martyrs on the offspring of Adam.So the place is forbidden to remind the two parties with their father, and it is the righteous of any aspect that is the one who is intended by the speech in which the Arabs are given, and the one who is the one who is the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the past The greatest praise of Ibrahim by mentioning the construction of the forbidden house and what followed it until the kiss was mentioned and the extension You were a testimony, when he attended the death of the death [Al -Baqarah: 133] to lead to his saying and said they were sodels, or Christians are guided [Al -Baqarah: 135] and he returns to Tafil It is the origin of Islam and that the participants are not in any of them, and so is the Jew and the Christians.The remembrance of these two things opened the preference of the merits of the two parents, Adam and Abraim, and the news came to one of the people of the same.So you are able to fate the words and remember, as his Lord is filled with words.And among the people who claimed that his saying, “And when he was afflicted,“ I have a compassion for his saying “My blessing“ meaning that they remember my blessing and my murmur (P-701) The preacher in the children of Israel, and dislocated “and fear a day [Al -Baqarah: 123]” between the two of the groans, and that is to hinder the inclusion of the verse, and I have been integrated in that.” And his saying does not attain the covenant of the unjust and in this verse is another intention, and it is the guidance of the resignation to the virtue of the country of the forbidden country and the forbidden house, to reside in the argument We copy the house of the sanctuary of the sanctuary, and they will be brought up to the stabbing in Islam with the fact that the copy is in it, and to the alienation of the general of the people of the book, because it is the one who follows it.To show them that the Kaaba is the most excluded and that God has subjected it to this nation that alerts him to the advantage of this religion.And the abuse is the abuse of the calamities, the form of the abuse is here for the exaggeration, and the adornment and the adoption and presented in its saying, and in that way of your Lord is great [Al -Baqarah: 49] Because whoever costs others with something that is to be taught to be joined by awaiting his act or leaving it, so the adversity is obligatory, so it is a metaphor for the metaphor.Because God has assigned him the sans and his nations are either from the virtue and etiquette, or from the actions that are for him Take off, and you make it a representative, and it was not the way of the mandate, a neighborhood, not a referral, and this indicates that Abraham is not to him Its soul to receive the project, so when Excellent what I commanded to be revealed to him with the sacrifice, and she is in his saying, “I make you an imam for people, so you will be a sentence“ I make you for the people of the imam ” It is permissible that the lameness is the insulting of the abandonment, and it is his saying that I make you for people an interpretation of an interpretation of the virginity.And Imam the Messenger and the Etihad.And Abraham, the name of the Great Messenger, nicknamed the creature, and he is the pioneer of Bin Tarh, and the Arabs are named.Abar ibn Shalah ibn Arfashah, Bin Sam ibn Nuh, like this, says the teeth, and the meaning of Abraham in the language of Al -Kaldanin: a father, a merciful, or a father.Attiyah, and in Al -Tawarah that the name of Abraham is a conclusion and that God is what he revealed to him and his command was to be called by his honor, because he makes him the father of God A lot of nations.He was born in the Awar of the Classeans, 1996, and a sideline, and a thousand years before the birth of the Christ, then he moved with it and his father to the land of the land of the sole Bharan (it is a ritual) (P-702), then he came out of it for a dirt that hit the two times, and he entered Egypt and his wife entered Sara, and he was the king of Egypt, and you will not be blessed.He drew it, so he honored it and gave it to the Egyptian, whose name is transmitted, and it is the mother of his son.When he liked the sons of Bani Ibrahim Al -Bayt Al -Harram, this is your money.Abraham, 1773 seventy, seventy and seventy, and a thousand before the birth of the Christ, and in his name there are languages ​​for the Arabs: one of them is the honor, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the The second: Abraham was located in the readers of Hisham on the authority of Ibn Amir, where the name of Abraham was signed, the third: his veil was signed in Rajam, Zayd ibn Um I am coming to him, the righteous, and he is a prayer, and he mentioned the father of the Levant in the explanation of the secretary of the secretariat of Al -Farah in Abraham.Distraction, his expressions by opening distraction, showing it to the distraction.And the fans of the ten readers only read the first, and he read themselves in the second in three and thirty and thirty places that will fall on it, and it will fall on it, and it will fall on it, The readings are not written in the diligence of the authentic cruisers except Ibrahim, with the afflictions of the yaa.The distraction was not written in anything from the Qur’an, Abraham, after the distraction, after the narration of the readers of Hisham.He says in the Qur’an, thirty and three places We have a valuable journalist, so we looked at it, then he taught me that he found it in it, as well, and Abu Bakr ibn Muharran said: They read Abraham and claim that it is the reader of Uthaman - may God be pleased with him - so he said, Malik, here, Mustafa, Uthaman, then he will be called, then he will be in it, so if he is.The act of the verb is presented, and it is noticable that the intended is the one who denotes Ibrahim by adding the name of a Lord to his name with the observance of the brevity, so he did not say.(P-703) The words that God have revealed to him to Abraham, as the word is a memorial that indicates a meaning and what is meant by it is the phrase as it is in the saying of it, it is the one who says: And the best of it here, as the abuse is not separated by the project of Abraham, nor the simplicity of the story and the story, but the exhibition is the best of the premature of the prestige of the house He came with it completely, so it is permissible with the great part of the part, and this is the habit of the Qur’an in the wreatment of what is not in the place of the need Hanafi, which is the few numbers, many of the costs, so perhaps the matter of sacrificing his son, and commanding him with the two brothers, and the migration with a migrant to a slit, and a long time, He has a listening with a living from God to him in the vision, and he was named at that time in his saying, "The Almighty is the clear of the clear states [106] and the saying of it." The significance of the Fur in the compliance, and that is due to the intensity of determination, and the completion of the origin of the two verbs, or the last parts of the variety.And the transgression of the verb, I have fulfilled the guarantee of the metaphor of the metaphor, and it is the reasoning of the verb with the container of the verb, because it is like a place for him and in the sense of the fulfillment of the saying [Al -Najm: 37] And his saying has believed the vision [Al -Saffat: 105] The verb here in the sense of the verb rhythm on the face is the next face, and it is not intended to be the same as it It was deficient, as it is not intended that he did some of it and then came with some other, so his saying referred to him.This sentence is the intended from the part of the story, so it is its kindness to the significance that it was afflicted, so it is like your saying, I called it so and answered.And a sentence said that I made you for the people an imam who is inspired by a biased bias, arising from what was required by his saying, and when his Lord is given to his Lord, the word of the word With it, when it is required to be a junction, as it is from the sign to the story of the great news The method of the saying is that this saying is a correlation to what is indicated by his saying, and the Imam is derived from The mother is with the conquest of the hamstah, which is the integrity, and it is an act of effective from the formula of the hearing, such as the baptism, the veil, the vision, and the ward It has the right to the imam.What is meant by the Imam here is the Messenger, for the message is the most complete types of the imam and the Messenger are the most complete individuals of this type.Rather, it is amended by the two years to a messenger to an imam to be that indicating that his message is beneficial (P-704) the nation that is sent to it with the way of the ritual With the way of feeding, Abraham, peace be upon him, has passed away to many horizons, so he was transferred from the country of countries to Iraq and to the Levant, Hijaz, and Egypt, and he was in the whole.Tabjeel, and there is no doubt that Tabujil sends the rituals, and it was said that the religion of their righteousness followed in the Independent is the origin of the one who is the name of the peace of God He entered into that religion as it was entered into the Hanafi, and the brevity came in the story of the saying of the next one, and from my offspring, “So what will be in my time.” The imam's offspring of its types of mission, king, and an estate on the behalf of the etiquette in them, and the lowest types of the imam, as the whole man, is a valid for his sons and his sons.And his students.And his saying, “He said,“ And from my offspring, “A answer from Abraham, so if he was told by a saying without an unemployed on the way of the story of the rituals, as it was presented when he said: Whoever spoils in it [Al -Baqarah: 30] and the saying is kind to the speech of God, who will be called by the kindness of the conversion, and it is the kindness of the addressee as a word on what happened in the words For himself in the house of speaking, it will be completed for him something that the speaker left either from a neglect, or for the restriction of it, then it will be found by the name Full words in the conversation.And in the authentic hadith, “Jarir bin Abdullah said that the Prophet is on the testimony that there is no god but God, etc.He who asked him, and he did not give him, and he said, God cursed a camel, you made me to you, and Ibn Al -Zubayr said: “If her person is, and he called him, the kindness of the ritual.The scouts and that is because the most like it is in the location of the compassion, and the first is that the word of kindness is deleted and we call this class of the words of the words The silent, speaking what he really sees, is that he is attached to his words, so he was a way of kindness, and he is the majority as he is here, and he may be the way of the way As he said, they said: Rather, we follow what our fathers have been fulfilled.Fellow, it is a denial of their attachment to them with their saying and calling them, and it may be the exclusive way of the discretion, such as the saying of the servants.Mecca, “The tree is not supported.It is a news and a request for it, so if it is as it is here on the way of the presentation, it is the knowledge of the light of the speaking to him, with his acknowledgment as in the verse or the expression of it, as it is in the time of the time, as it is in the time of the time.It is in the creation, if the construction factor is composed, it is included that the conversation has the ruling of the conversable to it, and when the one who speaks to the conversion to the creation is the one who is the address The convergence of the recitation in it is that it is on the will of kindness on the work of the construction of the creation in the matter if the commander sympathizes with the effect of the matter of the command of the command, then the matter was Instead of compliance and so in the desert.And the conversation is deleted, which is denied by the shrine, that is, and some of my offspring or some of my offspring.And the offspring is the man’s relative and what he is born from him and his children and his daughters, and it is a derived either from the analogy as a name and he is the young of the teller And the atom with the wow and the waw, which is the source of the atom of the wind if it sheds, or from the arms of the tear, which is creation, so it is weighted it either the act of the line of the line.It is not a measure as they said in the proportions to an eternity of an ultra -moving the sign, or an effective, or a verb from the anchors, the anchors, or the arms by the slurring of the ya, or the ya, or the ya, or the yaw The gaming after its heart is J, and all this is a script of the weakness of the place, so it is not the measurement of the exchange.Rather, Abraham said, “And from my offspring” and he did not say and my offspring because he knew that the wisdom of God is from this world that you did not leave that it would be all of the people.He is imitated, and he did not ask what is usual, because a question is not from the etiquette of supplication.Rather, he asked his offspring, and the question was not limited to his comments, as he is the one who is incompatible in the chance of the one who said to the children of his religion on the height that does not require the father of the father The Son and the sons of the daughter in the kinship from the grandfather, but they are both in the ruling of the kinship, and as for the Qibliya building, it is a definition of knowledge that returns to the victory and the sake of the rule of the ritual ؎ Our children are the children of our children and our daughters.And a mother.As well as saying....(P-706) ؎ But the mothers of the people are aware ∗∗∗ in which they are created and for the children the children of this is a medium.And he said, "The Messenger of God ﷺ to whom he asked about the right to righteousness from his father." Your mother Then your mother, then your mother, then your father, and God Almighty said, and the human commandment of his parents carried his mother, while he was on the authority of him [Luqman: 14] and his saying is not.Foldedly and briefly for the partner who is achieved in which the invitation of Abraham, who does not achieve in it with the restriction of one of them, is because one of them is the one It is proven to be erased for the other on the way of brevity, but it is not mentioned the category in which the supplication is achieved because the intended is the remembrance of the other.Those who claim the day that they are the first people in Abraham and they are the people of the book and the Arabs of the Arab But he was a Muslim Hanaf, and he was not among the partners [Al -Imran: 67].Before urging on the interests, for those who are not achieved in the supplication of the other.The covenant of the unjust, that is, it does not include them, for the covenant is here in the sense of the certainty.Therefore, the Prophet has called him a covenant in his saying that your covenant and your promise, meaning that he does not obtain and enemy with the answer This, even if it is in a place from the Qur’an, I want it otherwise, and the male of the covenant will come in the wall of the norms.A pledge to Abraham, as a covenant, with his offspring, in the remembrance of the covenant.The participants, that is, those who have been wronged for themselves, when they shared with God, the Almighty said that the polytheism is a great injustice [Luqman: 13] and the darkness also includes the work The Almighty and their offspring are good and unjust to itself shown [Al -Asfat: 113] And the Qur’an has described the Jews with the descriptions of those who are in the saying Those are those who are unjust [Al-Ma’idah: 45].They are not new to the imamate to equate them with types of injustice, such as polytheism, and prohibiting the book, and its interpretation of their lusts, and the time of them, and they are in their lust On this description, they knew it.The injustice was the covenant.The one who is described as the great is not due to the chain of transmission of the imam to it, the meaning of the paths and the merits of the Muslims: the dispute, the attribute, the judiciary, the fatwa, the narration of the flag.The pride of the religion said: The gathering said of jurisprudence and the spoke to the immoral, if his immorality is not permissible.In the interpretation of Ibn Arafa, this is the same and the son of Arafa was transmitted from Al -Mazari and Al -Qaribbi from the Ghusour if he was held for the imam on the face His immorality with disbelief, his immortality must be made, and other than the tinkers, the Khawarj and the disgraced said, and some of the Sunnis of the Sunnah, and he said: And it is given the limits, it is obligatory to preach, and its obedience is left, as it is not obligatory in it in obedience, and this is with the ability to make it up, so if it is not able to do it, then it is not possible for it to be.It is to prevent the resurrection of it and that the patience is on its wounds, the first of the receipt of the security with fear and the angry of blood and the release of the hands of the fools and the immorality in the land, and this is in the land, and this is in the land.The saying of the scholars of the Sunnah and what was reported from Abu Hanifa from the permissibility of the lying of the immorality, and the extent of the permissibility of his being a judge.And the crowd read from the tenth of my covenant with the opening of the speaker, and it is a face of the faces in the speaker J, and he read it Hamza and a thunder.
