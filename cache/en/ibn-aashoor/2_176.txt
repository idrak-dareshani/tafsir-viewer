The Quranic researcher (P-126) is that God revealed the book with the truth and that those who disappeared in the book in the rings of a distant distance from the name In his words, if the chapter is prolonged between the thing and what is associated with it from the judgment, the cause, or the like, as the saying of the naps: الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم I showed the curse that you are my mother and the preceding words that are the one that he said, so what happened to them on the fire [Al -Baqarah: 175] and the meaning is that they deserve the torment of the one who is the one The book is the right, and their assignment is a bit of the book, a sacrifice for the truth, and that is a corruption and a change in the mourning of God; Because the right to the right is left by falsehood, as it has been clear, and the torment of them has the right to his faith, because he is against the intention of God, and he is the one who does not say to him God descended the book is the eye of the book that is mentioned in his saying that those who conceal what God has revealed from the book [Al -Baqarah: 174] and it is their book Al -Tawara and Al -Anjil in And the ruling is one, and on it, the sentence was separated from the sentence before it to run it from the course of the cause.It is permissible for the precedent to be the precedent is the hidden one that is taken from those who disappear, that is, they have fulfilled what they have been fulfilled because God has revealed the book to the right to know God blessed him with the tongue of Al -Tawara.The meaning is that they have seen the righteousness of the prophet with envy and stubbornness; Because God has revealed the Qur’an on Muhammad, the book here is the best book in his saying that those who conceal what God has revealed from the book [Al -Baqarah: 174].And the sentence on this direction is a bunny to seek a baptism of their intention to give a honest His saying, "This is that God has revealed the book with the right.And he said it, and those who disappeared in the book in a shortage of distress, but he was kind to wow, because it is included in the fullness And their return, and what is meant by those who have disagreed with the intention of what is said by those who conceal and those who parted, so all of them are on one form.(P-127) It is intended from the book that is taught in it that it is determined that it is intended from the book in its saying.The book is revealed.Speaking in the same way, and it is what is meant by disagreeing with this direction that they have disagreed with those who believed in them or disagreed with what they described by the Qur’an, or from it.Lingy what does not agree with their whims and believe what is supported by their books, and it is necessary that what is meant by the book is the one who is intended from the one who is erected in its saying, what is revealed God is from the book that means the supply and the Gospel, that is, they have disagreed with the one who read it and who change it and in faith in the Gospel and faith in the convergence, and from the one who is the one They disagreed in the book what the involved is included and that the difference is the disagreement of their excuses from the Qur’an when they said: magic, poetry, priesthood, or myths.But it is a result of the context of speaking on the people of the book, and it is also the necessity that what is meant by the book is the gender, that is, those who have disagreed with the books of God With the Qur’an.And the increase in the endowment in the place of giving in its saying: The book is that the dissolution is resigned by itself for its wilderness, the example He said it, and those who disagreed in the book varying distance.And the description of the slurry by the distance is a mental metaphor, that is, with a distance from the agreement, as it is the Almighty and they are not disturbed.
