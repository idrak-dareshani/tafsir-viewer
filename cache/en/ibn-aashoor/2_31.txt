The researcher knows the Adam of all the names, it is kind to his saying, he said that I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30] It is required by his saying that I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30], then you know the Adam of the names and the appearance of his virtue with his acceptance of this, the good A pilgrimage to his saying to them that I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30], that is, what you do not know from the grandmother of this creature with the difference in the land, and the kindness of the remembrance God for the angels and the remembrance of their conjugation indicates that this caliphate is Adam and that Adam is a name for that caliph, and this is the one who said the bodies of the scandal Al -Nabah: ؎ I dismayed to them, I did not know the gossip from the sides of your arms and the sane parents, then he said after that: ؎ I have been afraid until it increases my fear of me Omar, Omar, that his horses will be between us between a barefare and a barefoot, so he indicated that what he mentioned is preceded by the mind that is between your eyes It is signed from the invasion of Amr ibn al -Harith al -Gasani, Diar, the children of Aff from his people.(P-408) “The name of the first human being, Abu al-Bashar, in the language of the Arabs, and it was said by the transmission of the Abraiya because“ Adam ”in the transmission in the sense of the earth, which is the one who is a relative, and it is a relative, and it is a closeness.Adam was created and prolonged in his conditions, so it is not far from the name of my father al -Bashar.When the Arabs and the crossings, with the origin of the sublime languages, they agreed upon it.It was called in the travel of the formation of the delegation with this name, Adam, and he fell into the Arab knowledge of the Arabic knowledge that Adam called his soul, and that is, that is, the one who is mortal.Reading.I said: Perhaps I will warm Etham, as I will learn it when his saying is the Almighty, you are the garden of Heaven [Al -Baqarah: 35] and for the first human beings in the name The old Persians, as I have come with the opening of the kaf in his first and in the midst of the remaining and remaining in the last of it, and it is also called, as well as a thousand and the one who is the one who is the one The separate gossip, they said that he stayed in the paradise three thousand years, then he lined up to the ground, and he lived in the land three thousand years of last year, and his name is in the grace of the Al -Tawarah, and this name was transmitted to the elderly languages ​​from the books of the Christian religion, and his name “Adam” by the refinement of the sign, for it is a name on the weight of the adulterers, so it is a name for the adulterers of the same He gathered on “Idam” with a bouzen, so as a conclusion was collected, and this is the one who refers to the owner of the scouts, and he made the abandonment of his detection as a man who is a distraction And I want to Press and like that, that is, they are a lost and the right.Al -Jawhari said: Its origin is two wives with two weights.His interpretation is that his origin is the elders, so the second gossip in the collection wow, because it has no origin as it was answered by Al -Jawhari.Perhaps I derive the name of the color of the delegation from the name of Adam, close to the opposite.The name is a collection of a name, and it is in the language.The human beings were dared to seek the use of some of them with one, so he obtained from that unique or compounds from that, and that is the meaning of the name of the name.What was said is that the name is called what indicates something whether it was noticed, his class, or his action was delusional in the language.Perhaps they are inspired by him until he derived it from the heavens, which is the mark, and that is on his peace, it does not require that he remain a charity for the origin of his detection.It was said: It is derived from the heavens because it is (P-409) when it was indicated by the self.It was said: It is derived from the name because it is a characteristic of the mourning.The appearance is that it is derived from the heavens and that it is a heavens with the breaking of the sine and the mim was because they gathered him on names, and if only the origin of the heavens, it was not the same as the same The last of it is an everlasting wow on the part of the sophistication, and it was an excessive thousand, and they gathered it on the slices.And it is clear that the names that Adam taught is a conservation that indicates the same things that the human being needs to express their need for their need, or their appearance, or the benefit of them Some of them are with some, and it is - that is, the benefit - what we call the day with the news or the communication, so it appears that what is meant by the names is the name Personal, and the names of the sexes from the animal, the plants, the stone, and the makers of what is on the view of the human being, as a result of the name of Heaven, the king, the king, the king, and the king, And a fruit.We find that according to the first human language, and that is likely to be that it is not what Adam taught him to start something from the names of the suffering and the events, then then it is so It is told about the incident of an event or a matter of the same for the same one between the name of the self and the name of the event.Water is cold or returns water.This is more likely that the origin of the detence is the source, not the verbs, because the sources are a fine of the types of names.And the adaptation of the names is the definition of gender, I want to seek refuge in the significance He taught him all the names of the well -known things, then in that world, as it is a nose of a well -known as well as: The one who appears with the guidance is what is more than it is not appropriate for his knowledge of the rule, and the destiny of God is good for that.And the defamation of the names is beneficial that God has taught Adam every name that is his name and its signs, and the gathering of the gathering is here, as it is not evaluated to say that he says, The expulsion of the individual is more intense of the expulsion of the collection in the world with the words of the words that are not liberated, and the origin of it is taken from the words of the silence and we will be fulfilled But the righteousness is the one who believes in God and the last day, the angels and the book [Al -Baqarah: 177] in this surah.And (all of them) is a certainty of the meaning of expulsion, so that the covenant is not deluded from it, so the word "is not increased," the general "is a meantime, but it was driven by it.And “every” is a name indicating the inclusiveness and surrounding, as it is added (P-410) is to it, and the most of what comes in addition to the guarantee of what he accepted, and he will be Arabized, and he will be sure of what he did.It is independent of the Arabs if the confirmation is not intended, but rather the surrounding is a mandate of the addition of the addition or the value, then if the added is not mentioned to it To be a mandate for the addition, it is considered a knowledge of the addition, so do not enter the lame of the definition.And God knows the Almighty, either with the way of reciting the presentation of the name of the name, so if he sees him, his name will be embraced with the voice of the one who hears the same On that self with a fierce knowledge.Or the learning will be with the meeting of a fierce science in the same as Adam, where he is dangerous in his mind the name of something when he is presented to him, so he will be subjected to the name Parents may be able to benefit them other than him, and that by creating the power of the heroic in it and made it a capacity on the place of the language as he said: The man of God: [3] And all of that teaching; As the learning is the source of his knowledge, if he made it with knowledge, like his literature, then he does not confine in the recitation, and if he is in it, it is known.Whatever was how the learning was a reason for the fact that the human being on the rest of the species of his gender is the strength of the penetration and the events of the ablution of the ablution of the ablution of the ablution of the ablution In the face.And that was also a reason for the people of the person to be ahead of some of them with some of the arrival of the outlet from the benefit of the unknowing A transcendent, expressing what is in his destruction, was created by a realized scholar, and it was created as a teacher, and this is the origin of the origin of the sciences and the two guests and the one who is free of time, because if you look at it, if you look at the I found her names for heavens and the suffering of me Destruction and define it to see the delivery of what is made in the mind to others.And both of the two things were deprived of the rest of the animals, so that his individuals did not compromise, unless it is vulnerable to the good of the image, or the power of the one or the power The rest of the gins are like tanning and mourners.With this, you know that the lesson is in the knowledge of God, the Almighty, the names of the names, whether it was the one who taught him the names of the rituals, then what is the same, or the names of all of you In a single language, it is the beginning of the skin since that teaching, whether it was in all the languages ​​that his offspring will be brought up with, and the anomalies of the nations, whether the names of the nations, are the names of the nations Just or the names of the suffering and the adjectives, and whether the one who is intended from the names is indicative of the suffering or every indication of something, or other than it, or other than the one who is in the shadows of the thief progress; As it is to achieve that is not perfect under the interpretation of the Qur’an.Perhaps many of the interpreters, it was for them to have the effect of Adam with the knowledge of God, attached to the knowledge of a number (P-411) from the one who is the same.So they glorified this learning with its enhancement, and they disappeared from the location of the lesson and the angel of the guidance, which is the finding of his great power that was the first, which was the first, Therefore, there was a defamation of the miracle of the angels from being affected by this or by their knowledge of anything from the names, and if it were the misfortune and the virtue in the knowledge of the From the names in the languages, it is enough to show the creek of the angels, the blood of their knowledge of the crowd of the names, but Adam taught the names of the fences of the day.The angels have a dome for them in his virtue.And there is no evidence in this verse that the languages ​​are an intercession, that is, God has the Almighty has made it human to the tongue of Adam, and it is not upon his numbers, because the way of the knowledge is in The names are a summary of the names, as we presented it.People are agreed upon that the ability has an important concern of God, and that is based on him whether Adam is based on a single language or all the languages ​​of human beings.And the names of everything, or his inspiration, or created the heavy power, and the question is a vulnerability in the knowledge of God and in the origins of jurisprudence and in it, and there is no effect in it, and there is no effect in it, and there is no influence in it.Others said that Al -Mazari said: except in the case of the heart of the language.The truth is that the shepherd of the law is prohibited and otherwise it is permissible.Al -Mazari had sinned and all those who Ramn made to make this dispute a fruit other than what was mentioned, and in that it is readable and his return is a length, and his command is not hidden from the peace of the mind.* * * Then he presented them to the angels, and he said: Do you tell me with the names of these if you are true.Learning and between the presentation is humiliating, and it is a period that receives the names of Adam or the period of its indignation and setting the names of the heavens.It appears that (then) is here for the arrogance of the arrogance, as it was in its kindness, because the arrangement of this offer and the appearance of the knowledge of the angels, the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge God and his ruling, all of that raised a arrangement in the purification of the admiration of Adam and his discipline.From all of them.And when a concept was given a name from the additional concept that the minds of it stops on the reason other Feeling, not referring to the heavens, so he made the way to take advantage of that and delete the memories of the names.And Zadir (their offer) to the heavens because it is exposed to the villages of his saying that they were told me with the names of these and the vertebra It requires a name, and this is the briefing of the deletion, and the names are not presented because the show is the convergence of the self after its hidden, and it is the offer of the thing to the sale, and the sake of the sake is not So you are aware that the disposal is the consequences of the names, either by being subjected to images from the selfs of the same and it is asked about the knowledge of its names, i.E.The knowledge of the verbal, or the one who is the same, And its characteristics, either by exposing the self and suffering with the creation of a sign indicated by the suffering as the shock of the courage in the image of the action of its owner and the knowledge in the image As we are seen in the sculpted images or the lengthy of the minds of the minds of the right, the Romans, the Persians, and the Percenous forms of the Evurge, with the rituals of the rituals of the This is the form that the exhibits are courageous or the meaning of knowledge and that is brought together in the dreamy mirrors.It is obtained that the state is mentioned in the verse is the case of a world that is broader than the world of misfortunes and material.And returning the guarantee of the rational remembrance of the heavens in his saying their presentation to the abuse, because the honor of the ills with the minds and their attributes on the authority of the one who is the same.Its origin is for the minds of an Arabic style, which is the same as the Almighty.The disposary is other than the names until it is not misunderstood.That is.And the matter in his saying is a miracle of a curtain, such as the one who is commanding, knowing that the command is a scholar of that, so this is not the same as it is the same.Physicians.The form of the form of the matter is used to be metaphor, then that meaning The metaphor is obligated by the knowledge of the matter with the miracle of the commander, and that is required by the knowledge of the commander of the commander with it.The news is the news, and it is the news that is the great and the delusional, in which the Samaitah is keen on its acquisition, and for that, the news is included in the meaning It is one of what is known and believed in a more special face than the conclusion of the absolute news, so it is more special than the news.And his saying if you are true to him, either he wanted it if you are true that you are better than this creature if they say them and we will praise them [Al -Baqarah: 30] That.Or he wanted if you (P-413) are honest in the numbers of the grandmother of Adam with the difference as it was indicated by their saying, and I will make it in it who spoils in it [Al-Baqarah: 30] In your praise [Al -Baqarah: 30] for the abandonment or advertising for those who are from the people of the highest infection with the eloquence of the symptoms of what we have seen.The mandate is among the news between the names and between their sincerity, while it was called by the one that is required to be the penalty of the part of the condition that the knowledge is from the name The righteous to benefit the knowledge and benefit them, or express the knowledge of the facts and characteristics The world is action or by force, and the owner of this description is the new one with the disagreement in the world because the cheek of this disagreement is the mobilization, the guidance, the guidance, the guidance, the guidance of the Without a need for eagerness in the majority of the fragments, and all of that is needed for the heavy power or its branches, and the royal powers on its honorable power but it is reconciled She was harnessed for her, do not prepare her, nor do you know about it, and the installation, and what is mentioned of the diversification of its behavior and the correctness of its business, but it is from the one who brings it to God.Expressing it with mockery.Thus, the face of the matter appeared with the news of this condition, and it may be confused about it.And if the news is exempt, they are exempt from their condemnation of Adam, then if the lodger of the honesty is the one who called them that they are the most powerful, then it was established, and if it was the same, and if it was the same The human beings are not good for the disagreement.A matter of miraculousness, and the mourning of it was made by the honesty that was behind this Know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30]
