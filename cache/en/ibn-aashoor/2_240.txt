The researcher, who died from you and vowed to be a trustee for their faces, belonging to the ways, and it is not a breakthrough.And God, dear, is a wise, signed by this verse here, after his saying, and those who miss from you and vigils waves, they will be luke in.[Al -Baqarah: 234] Its ruling is violated, in the phenomenon, the ruling of its counterpart, which was presented, and on the words of the public, the verse is preceded in the descent to the verse and those who are from you Wives they stir [Al -Baqarah: 234] whose location is clouded: as it is the past in the descent, delayed in the place.And the gathering is that this verse has started the ruling of the deceased, in the house of its husband, and that is at the beginning of Islam, and then we copied the This was narrated from Ibn Abbas, Qatada, Al -Raba’i, and Jabir Bin Zaid.And in Al -Bukhari, in the book of interpretation, on the authority of Abdullah ibn al -Zubayr, he said: I said to the sake of this verse and those who die from you and vowed to the righteousness The last verse was copied, and she did not write it, he said: I will not change anything from it from his place, my son, my brother For it, and on it, then it will put it here with a lord of the Prophet ﷺ to say that I am not going to change anything from his place.It is beeworthy that Ibn Al -Zubayr wanted the other verse of Surda Al -Nasi in the inheritance.And in Al -Bukhari: Mujahid said: God has started the number four months and ten times that are used for the people The Sunnah is a trustee, if she wanted to live in her will, and if she wanted to go out, and there was no one with a certain inheritance, so that it was its right to leave it.With inheritance.So do not be exposed in this verse for the enemy, but it is in the Bayan of other ruling, which is the positive of the commandment for it by the roofs about it: if you want to be confused about the time (P-472) They were on it, and the one was a reprehensible for the period of the knife, not the number, and this is what a Mujahid said, I say what is in this section, which is the acceptance.And know that the Arabs, in the ignorance, was a follower that the woman, if it is fulfilled by her husband, will stay in the evil of a house for her, and a unit of her clothes.An avoiding adornment and goodness, as it was presented in the footnote to the interpretation of his saying, so there is no wing to you, so what they did in themselves with themselves, from the good: Islam is the best of that in the bad situation, and the number of death and the darkening of this, when the heavily of that is less than that, in the beginning of the matter of the abomination of the habit, the matter To confuse them by silence the homes of the husband and hypocrisy It is upon her from his money, if you want the knife with the house of the husband, then if you come out and refuse to the knife, this is not agreed upon, so the choice became for the sake of the woman in that It is possible to leave it, then the transcription of the spending and the commandment of the inheritance, for God when he wanted to copy the number of ignorance, and took into account his kindness in the people in Qutaqah, The one in the way of the one who is in the way, and approved what is with him in the house of the period of the number, but he stopped him on the guardian of the husband, when he died, for his death, and for his death The wife is that, if it is not recommended or not accepted, then the knife is not upon it, and it has the exit, and it is used where it is, and it is copying the will of the silence, The rak'ah in the place of its promotion is the time of the number of the hadeeth of the pharaoh.And his saying is a guardian of their faces, his readers, Nafaa, and Ibn Katheer, Al -Kisa’i, Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim, Abu Jaafar, Jacob, and Khalaf: Transferred from the absolute active, and its origin is a will in the interest of his action, so he turned into raising to the intent of the permanence as a saying: Jamil, as it was presented in the interpretation of praise to God [Al -Fatihah: 2], and his saying: He holds a well -known or wipes with goodness [Al -Baqarah: 229].And when the source was in the absolute verb, in the same way, indicating the type, it is permissible for it to come to the beginning of it, so it is not a disbeliever, as it is not a disgrace, as it is not a disgrace, as it is not the same.A certainty until it contradicts the appetite, but rather the one who is the type, and he said: (For their faces), he told him, and Abu Amr, and Ibn Amir, Asim: A guardian of the installation, so it will be his saying to their faces related to it on the basis of the absolutely relevant acting, which comes from the verb of his verb.And the appearance of the verse is that the will is the will of the dead, so it will be from the commandment that it is commanded by those whom the death brings: the same as the commandment that is the one who says If one of you attends the death, if you leave the best of the commandment for the debtors and the closest [Al-Baqarah: 180], then on this compassion if the died is not recommended for the died, then the died is for the time He knocked me, for it, and she may be presented that the wife with the commandment is a choice between that the commandment is accepted, and between it is coming out and said: Ibn Atiyah said: Abbas, laughter, giving, and rabid: that his saying is a trustee for their faces is a guardian of God, the Almighty, for the obligatory peoples, and this is the saying God bless you in your children [Women: 11] and his saying is a commandment from God [Women: 12], so that is not stopped from the promoters of the dead, nor on the acceptance of the Zawajat It is dedicated to it, and it is necessary for them to be attached to a thieves, and his attachment to it is the one who has been inhabited by it, A deleted man denoted the place for the rest of what was decided in the first direction.And his saying is a belonging to the state: the meaning of the enjoyment is presented in his saying, he has a right to the well -known for the good.Doing it, that is, to enjoy them, and he has seized the possession of the rejectionist, so it is attached to the commandment and the appreciation of the will of their faces.And “to” a muezzin with something that has been made by the one who is in the case, and its estimation: he has been silent to the one, as his saying is otherwise.And the definition in the states is to know the covenant, which is the one who is known to the Arabs from the era of the ignorance, which the woman who died from it is used to, so it is the one who said: ؎ To the one who is the name of peace on you and whoever cries a complete one, he has apologized and said that it is not a state of certainty, or in a way The thing confirms my exile against it, and it is the saying of Abu al -Abbas the blind, praising the children of the mother: If you go out, then there is no wing to you, it is the saying of a group with a difference that is: if you are the acceptance of the acceptance of the commandment, then they will come out.And other than the known one of the rhetoric, the marriage, and the adornment in the number, so this is not from the known.(P-474) And on the saying of the other team that made the commandment of God, it must be his saying, if they are exalted, kindly, for the sake With your sticks, then he closed [Al -Shuaraa: 63], meaning that if the day is done, then they will be broken, so there is no wing to you, so what they did in themselves: that is, whoever goes to you, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, and whoever goes out, The denial is like adultery and otherwise, and it is obtained that the known one is interpreted: otherwise what was forbidden in the state in which he signed al -Kharj, and all of that is a verb in the soul of the soul.Its interpretation (and the denial is known here and its definition in the advanced verse, because this verse was revealed before the other, so it became with you with).And I count this is not straightforward, and that the definition is the definition of gender, which is the denial of whether, and the words were presented about the desired readings to me - with the authority of the An Arabic joke with his words of exalted and those who die from you and give up marriages, and they should be tired of themselves [Al -Baqarah: 234] the verse.
