The Quranic researcher (P-440) Say: We are all connected from it, so it comes to you from me, so whoever follows my guidance, then there is no fear for them, nor are they grieving, and those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve and disbelieve.Those who are the people of the fire are in it, immortalized by the sentence of our saying, they are tied, so you will be able to repeat it to be for the sake of the purpose of the purpose in the verse of the Qur’an Indicating that it is in the words that Adam has been attached to it, so this is the release of the inventory of the connection of what was related to the meaning of the meaning (and we said) Some of you are an enemy [Al -Baqarah: 36] and his saying, but it comes to you from me, when he was separated between these two who are commented from what he has given up from the saying From his Lord is a word, and he was blessed with him that he is the Most Merciful.[Al -Baqarah: 37].And the Samaid is anxious that it is a discourse for the believers on the usual Qur’an in art, so that we will pay that, the saying of our saying: To link the words, and for that, it was not overlooked (our less) because among them is like the fullness of communication, so that we say it to our saying.Some of you are an enemy [Al -Baqarah: 36] And we said, “Get up with some of the enemy” [Al -Baqarah: 36] so that there is something from a very extensive in the words, so that it is not a return to (beyond).Slaves in the knowledge of the bodies with the reciprocity of the saying of the Almighty, do not calculate those who rejoice in what they came and love to do what they do not.With a reward of torment [Al -Imran: 188], and the affirmation was reported by the reintegration of the re -re -re -preserved.It was said that it is a second matter with the despair that I am connected from heaven to the worldly sky with the first command, then I am looted from the worldly sky to the earth, so we will return) To alert it to the choice of the time of the two words and the stubbornness, and it is a interpretation that benefits that the raids and distances are not transmitted by the travel Paradise to coordinate the conservative in his saying, and each of them is a desire [Al-Baqarah: 35] (P-441) and his saying, so the Satan is removed from it [Al-Baqarah: 36] what is forbidden to be the one who will be All, as he did not precede a hostility to the heavens, the face is at me for the restriction to be a return (lick) the second to other than the one who is the same I did not think that he does not think that the repentance of God is upon him and his consent of him when his repetition with the repentance of the matter of the matter of the Head of the Pardon Paradise, so he returned to him after The acceptance of his repentance to know that this is a being, not a referral, because he is the intention of God Almighty and a thousand of the phases that God wanted to be exalted, and he is the one who has made him the same And it has another sign, which is that pardon is from the repentance in the zajar and the punishment.As for the realization of the effects of the violation, which is the disciplinary, the pardon of it is a corruption in the world; Because the actor of violation, if he did not see the effect of his act, he was not disciplined in the future, so forgiveness with him in that is missing, because of the ruling, then the ruling is that He was placed and angry with his educators, then he repented, so he relieved him, so the pardon is attached to the punishment.That is not good tolerance in it, and therefore, when God repented to Adam, may God be pleased with him, and he did not take him with a punishment, nor is heaping in the world, but he did not know Its violation, which is the frustration of paradise, to see the effect of his disgrace and misfortune, so that it is that it is that the struggle is if it is intended from (beyond) the second is the second.Adam.And (all) is the case.And (all) is a name for the two groups, such as a group of gathering, so that they are in it in one case in which it is one and is not in the original and a description, otherwise they said: His Sufism is applied and they have been interpreted by the saying of the Qayyis ؎, and they are a soul that all die in that it is in it for the sake and the meaning in the way.Included in it; Because they are equal in the assistance of the dowry.And his saying is that it comes to me from me, so whoever follows my guidance is a condition on a condition because ““ a condition of the condition is “conditional”, and the condition is not a condition, and the plot is a sign Coming, because with its inception indicating the condition, it was not the entry of “what“ the increase on it as its entry into “when“ and “” and “Ayn” On the saying that its origin is Mama; Because it was her increase to make it useful in the sense of the condition, then these words were not made for him with disagreement if the Arabs have been adhered to.Bennan of affirmation of the increase in the affirmation of the entry of his mark on his tools and on his action, for he is a certainty that does not benefit the achievement of the answer to the answer to the answer To comment, and for that, the condition of the condition is not confirmed by the affection, but rather it is beneficial to achieve the bond, that is, the universe (P-442) is the answer to the answer to the one A verified matter, not a referral, for the relationship is nothing but news from the news, as the news obtained it by stopping the obtaining of the penalty on the condition of the condition.Apparently for sure, and the condition of the condition was released with either the coffin of confirmation, such as saying the east: It is not good at his Sibu and the Farisi, and he said: The cold and the gospel is a variety, so they made the act of the verb from it.And his saying, whoever follows my guidance, “who is a conditional with a way to enter the fulfillment in its answer, then there is no fear for them because the fulfillment, and if it entered into the news of the one Its treatment is the condition of the condition, so let us be carried out on the condition of the distance.The guidance was shown in his saying, and he is the eye of the guidance in his saying (from me is a guidance), so the place was for the guarantee that is the one who is the second of the second.He was packed with the guidance to increase a messenger in the dedication of those who addressed to a limit as we sent us to Pharaohs a messenger [Al -Muzzammil: 15] so he cursed the Pharaoh of the Messenger [16] It is independent of itself, which does not comprehend a pioneer who needs a re -remembrance until its path comes to the path of the likeness or the advice, so it is noticed, and it is noticed, and it is noticed.The souls are to be lying and satisfied, as it appeared in its saying and say the truth came and the falsehood was lost.And from the saying of Bashir: If the opinion is informed of the opinion, then seek a good advice or a firm advice, and you will make the Shura to you, the place of the shadow, The pioneers ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ A brick of the example of the example, and this appears the face of the second guidance of the guidance in the addition of the majestic of the majesty without “Al” with that it is the original in the place of the phenomenon.Like this transmitted sentence is not missing anything that the first sentence is included, as the first sentence is included and the guidance was described by the one who comes from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who comes from the one Act.(P-443) And the two sayings in his saying are exalted, so it comes to you with the ruddy of the condition that indicates the vastness of the part of the condition of the condition, the rest of the people, And inflicting the fact that the one who is your guidance is in the future, and it is not serious for it, as the master says to his servant if he does not work with what he had to do with him, then he will be angry with him On the authority of it: If you command you, another day, then do not prepare for the same, then you will be exposed to it, that it is exposed to it that the wiseness is attached to the command of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the end Few of grade, and this is the face of the one who missed the owner of the scout, his veil from him is a cost of his cost to force the verse to be a sign of the saying With the mission of the messengers to seek to help from the mind of the mind in the faith of God with the way of God's guidance to the people of God He presented it in knowledge, so his report was like this The saying of the number of the messengers of the messenger is that the guidance does not specialize in the faith in which the mind sings about the message with them, but the exaltation The mind is of his awareness, and it is also upon them, and it is obligatory for God to inform people of people, so the dislocation of the two people will remain with the risk of doubt here, so that it is the case.With our people, O Ash'ari, who is all the guidance of all of God, upon God, if our things are to infer it on that, as he did the good, but we do not see it.And his saying, but he comes to you from the guidance of the verse, which is in the sense of the covenant, God took him to Adam, so his offspring must be required to follow all of them, and that he will come to them This is a matter of God, so the torment is required (P-444), and all the divine bodies that address the people of the people are included in the people of the people (Hoda) The form of the general, and the first of the guidance and its hardship with the path of its followers, who came from God to the Bakery of Hashar, and he is the religion of Islam, which he has given to all of you, The signed for his saying (and those who disbelieved), etc.God took the covenant from Adam on the follower of the general guidance as his saying, and when he took the God of the Prophet, whoever is the one who has the good A book and wisdom [Al -Imran: 81] The verse, and this verse indicates that God does not take humanity with what they are close to the misguidance, except after they send them to them The interrogation of the bodies, then there is no doubt in that or a disagreement, but in the glorification of God Almighty and what is required of the attributes of the blades, then he will run on the dispute between our scholars, in the mind Perhaps the verse indicates that the guidance that comes from God in that has happened from the covenant of Adam and Noah, and all of them knew all of them, so it is a rhetoric, and it is not a prayer that is not.Two sayings about Al -Ash'ari, and it was said no, and when the dismissed and the dowry is that it is a mental evidence.And he said it, so there is no fear for them by a negative of the people of fear.And (fear) is marrying in the readers ’readings, and Jacob is built on the conquest and they are Jahan in the name of not the exile of the Seni, and the one has been narrated.The four of the hadiths of the mother of a cultivation, "My husband, like a charge, is not free, no, no, no fear, no fear, or a woman." And by building the name on the conquest, a text in the negativeness of the spectrum, and raised it, a minor to the exile of the sex and the exile of one individual, and for that, then if it is the same The village is a phenomenon in the denial of the sitting.And his saying, and those who disbelieved and lied to our verses, began that it is one of the sentences of what was said to Adam, so entrusting his remembrance here is a bond of the bodies of the offspring With the partners of the atoms of Adam, while he was lied to all miracles, all of which are the Qur’an, kindness to (who) The condition in his saying, whoever follows my guidance, etc., is from the kindness of a fatal sentence on a fatal sentence, and it comes with the premature sentence from what is wrong.The power of the bond and the elaboration of the arrangement of the penalty on the condition and the nomination of it.Because the meaning of arrangement, causation, and incompatibility of jaws, he obtained another way, so he obtained the meaning of the condition of the concept of his saying, so whoever is a good thing It is upon them, for it is a virtue that is authorized by its concept with the warning of those who did not follow it, so it is a disagreement with sadness, so the smile will be watching what is indicated by this By saying it and those who disbelieved and lied to the verse.As for the meaning of causes, it was obtained from the knowledge of the news on the communication, which reached the one who is in the face of the face of the news and its highest on one of the interpretations, in the face of the two.The nomination of disintegration (P-445) was required by the news about them with the companions of the fire that is required for the mandate, then the expression of its saying in which they are in it The story of Adam was stressed by the occasion of the male of the guidelines, and it is not from the one who says to him, and the intended from this dissolution is the threw of the two parties to the one O people, worship your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 21] and say, how do you disbelieve in God [Al -Baqarah: 28] So the waw will be in his saying, and those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve, They disbelieved those who denied the Creator and denied his prophets, and they will be covered as it is as it is the divisions of the Qur’an, and the meaning: and those who disbelieve in me and my guidance as it was indicated.And the verses are the collection of a verse, which is the thing that indicates something that is hidden.The argument is a sign because it shows the hidden right.As Al -Harith bin Halaza said: “Whoever has it for him is good.Their communication with the king, Amr ibn Hindi.And God called the evidence for his existence, his hostility, and on the height of the hoping of the partner, he said, so he said, and what they bring from the verses of their Lord, but they were from them, and they said: [4] He is the one who made you the stars to guide them in the darkness of righteousness and sea.[Al -Anam: 99] And he said, and they were divided with God.Say, but the verses are with God [Al -Ankabut: 50] to his saying, the first people did not stop them that the book is revealed to you.His parts called verses, so he said, and if our verses are seen by them Know the faces of those who disbelieve the denial, who are almost intermediarted by those who recite our verses [Hajj: 72] and the bitter of these are the verses of the book and the one who is the one who is the right 1] Because every surah of the Qur’an miraculously shall be the same as the two of it, as it said, as they said, so they came with a wall of the like [Al -Baqarah: 23], so it was a sign of the righteous.His sentences were verses; Because it has some of the miraculous fate, and the parts of the other heavenly books were named verses, but what was mentioned in the hadith of the promoter is that the son of a shirt is when we have the same.The verse of the shame, so that the part of the mourning is likened to the part of the Qur’an, and it is one of the expressions of the hadith.And the origin of the verse at its Sibuyeh (P-446) “a“ act of investigation ”any“ or ““ or ““ on the dispute in that it is wi or a ya hey, who is derived from any of any of the people, or from any The burning of the cause is moved in which one of them is the heart of them and the first heart is reduced by a measure; Because the measurement of the two letters of the two righteousness of the two righteousness to the second one to be promoted, except for what was less than the part of the verse, the vain, the abyss, and the righteousness.What is meant by our verses here are the verses of the Qur’an, that is, and they lied to the Qur’an, any neighborhood from God.And the epidemic in his saying, and lied to our verses, a lot, whose entry is on the authority of the subject of denying, with the fact that the denying is prepared with the same and the words of the same, and I did not stand in the same way On the characteristics of this material and formula, so it is necessary that it is to confirm the sake of the lagum in the deny With your heads [Al -Ma’idah: 6] and the saying of the jungle ؎ that is good for you to see you the ground one and it is necessary that its origin is for the captive and that the origin is said to say that it is not.So he lied to him and lied to one means, and he was more than said: He lied to so -and -so, and lied to the vicious news, so he said (with our verses), and he will be dismissed.And his saying is in it, they are immortal of the two people who say it is the companions of the fire.The Bayan House, and between them is like the bladder of communication.
