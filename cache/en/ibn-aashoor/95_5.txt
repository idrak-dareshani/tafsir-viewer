The researchers of the Quran, the Zeatin, and the developer of two years, and this faithful country has created the human being in the best of the evaluation, then we repeated it as the lower.The verbal of the affirmative oath is given to the importance of the wise, which has the words, and the oath of the oath is divided into the division on it.And the figure is its appearance: the fruit that is famous for this name, and it is a fruit that the shape of it is similar to the shape The dignity of its peeling, the lesion of the peeling is similar to the same, the righteousness of the righteous, the good, the wind, the unlawful of the weighted, the same The young, and it is one of the best fruits, a picture, and a chewing ease, so it is a sign of the accuracy of the makers of God and the muezzin of his knowledge and the sake of his knowledge, and his knowledge of his knowledge.Its indication of divine attributes, as it is divided into the name of its way on the self, with the ears of the time of the people, as it created for them this is the goodness of this.What is the ease of plants does not need a lot of work and treatment.And the Ziton is also its appearance: the well -known fruit with the same olive, which is disgraced from it, and the people are fed up with it and their ears with it.And the division of it is like the oath of the wealth from where it is a sign of the attributes of God, with the signal to the grace of the creation of this fruit, the righteous, the righteous, the one who is sufficient And their lighting.And on the appearance of the two days of the two lines and the Zaynon, they hold them a group of the first two interpreters, Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Al -Hassan, Akramah, Al -Nakha’i, Al -Nakhi, And the dog, and that is because of these two fruits from the benefits of the people who are granted to them, that God created them for them, (p-421) (Sinin) and with (the faithful country) requires them to have a person who woke up on the occasion.Bani on the good after the flood.Perhaps this is the nomination of this inherent mountain in it, as the land may be called in the name of what is in it in many of the trees, such as the saying of the qais: With ommodia, a place came in the hair of the jungle, describing the clouds of his saying: ؎ ؎ On the mountain, which was built on the mosque, because the Ziton is alerted.This was narrated from Ibn Abbas, Al -Dhagak, Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd, Qatada, and Ikramah, and Muhammad ibn Kaab al -Qarashi.It is permissible for me to be the division by (figs and Ziton), meaning that the trees of these two fruits, that is, the one of them was given to them from the two sons of the tree from whom it is a kind of one from the goodness We have in these two capable places as Jarir said: I remember when you are stranded I know her, with a segment of a scent that was watered by Al -Bashim, so he called the validity of the Honor for the sake of the sake of the Habibah Smile.As for (the one of the two years), it is the known mountain as “the phase of Sina”.And the phase: the mountain in the language of the tip, and they are the Knanis, and this mountain was known by (the Phase of two years) for its parts in Sahara (Sinin), and (Sinin) Egypt and the country of Setsin.It was said: The Sunnahs of the trees with the Nabitiyah or the throat, and it was said: Al -Hasan was built by the language of the dust.And his definition in Arabic came to a form that similar to the form of the collection of the male, and it is not in a group, so he was rewarded in his Arabization to Arabize the same A penalty about the conscience, or the ya is a wilderness of the opening or the fracture, and that it is told about the ya with your investigation of its laws with the sails of the Arabs like: It is said: (And the phase [Al -Tor: 1] and a legendary book [Al -Tor: 2]).(P-422) and the faithful country: Mecca, named the Secretary; Because whoever entered it was safe, the faithful is an act in a sense of effective, such as the hearing preacher in the house of Amr ibn Maadkarb, and it is permissible to be with me The metaphorical chain of transmission, that is: the safe person, they will be, he said: (And he believed in them from fear [Quraysh: 4]).Referring to the greatness; Because the descent of the surah in that country is present with a woman and a hearing from the addressees, the counterpart of his saying: (I do not divide this country [Al -Balad: 1].And according to the second of the two pregnant women, the two lines of the two and the Ziton, the appropriateness between the faith is completed, and it is a sign of the diligence of the greatest of the wickedness, A gesture to the absence of Noah, which is the first project for a messenger, and the Zayton is a gesture to the project of Abraham.Sinin) is a gesture to the province of Al -Tawarah, and (the faithful country) is a gesture to the vigor of the project of Islam, and there was no gesture to the project of Jesus because it is a complement to the Charity.The Ziton may be on the authority of the place and that it is the mosque, the Aqsa, a gesture to the place of the law of Jesus, peace be upon him.Because the mosque is the best of Soliman - peace be upon him - so he did not descend in it a project before the project of Jesus and be his saying: (This country is the mother of the mother) And the project of Islam, because Islam came to the origins of the Hanafi, and that is the gesture of this verse that was stated in it in his saying: We have insisted on you and what we have commanded by Abraham, Moses, and Jesus [Al -Shura: 13]), and that is the formation of gesture to the nods of Noah, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad - upon them - peace be upon them - Its appearance, so that it is contrary to the masculine composition of the outstanding formation that it is to take into account The two wealth are subjected to the two names, and the two are the two signs of the two sins on two signs of the land of the earth, so that it comes to the one who has come.Al -Turaiyah, and the appropriateness of (Sinin), the connections of the surah.And in the beginning of the surah by the department in the way that includes the territory of the most famous divine religion, with the consumption of the misery of the widow of the Surah, which is that God created the human being in On the premium of the premium, it is perceived for the evidence of the Creator and its Dummy.In it, there is no gesture that what is empty (P-423) is that of the bee and the boredom has been sharp from the origins of the biography of God, all of them by cutting off the view of its disagreement in the righteousness, and it is sufficient for me.Consumer in the meaning of the meaning.And the sentence (We created the human being in the best of the evaluation) with what was composed of it is the answer to the division.And the division is indicated that the evaluation is a hidden evaluation and that the response is a hidden response that must be managed to consider it, as we will show it in the saying of it:.So, it is more likely to be sure of the division; Because the most people of the people in their heads are running in a state that resembles the state of those who deny that they were created on the innate.And the creation: a formation and a creation of something, and God created all people is that he created the origins of the creation and found the first origins in the beginning of the creation as he said: 75) And the reasons for the generation of the vocals were created from the origins, and their atoms of them were woven from them as he said: (And we created you, then we filmed you, then we said to the good 11]).And the definition of (the human) may be that the purity of the bond, which is the shame in which the gathering of what is in it with its existence in the outside is in the face of it.And it is carried in the sense: We created all people in the best evaluation.It is permissible for a person to be aware of the fact that their saying is: the man is better than the woman, and the saying of the righteous: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ It is noticed in it the individuals of the spectrum, but rather the state of what is in its origin without what is exposed to its individuals, which changes some of its characteristics.And from the exaltation of the exaltation of the Almighty: (The human being was created by this [Al -Maarij: 19]), and it was presented in the Surah of Loving.And the evaluation: making the thing in a milestone with the opening of the end, meaning: justice and equality, and good (P-424), the evaluation is its fullness and its righteousness, meaning the goodness of the person, For him, and this requires that it is a special evaluation of a person who does not share it in it other than the creatures, and it becomes clear in the number of the phenomenon and the inner powers and the inner He signed for him as he spoils him, and some other powers are not hindered by the performance of his job, because others of his soul were without him in the evaluation.And he died (in) is beneficial The metaphorical custody of the meaning of the property and the king, it is used in the sense of the BB The meaning to the perception of the custody to benefit the power of the mobilization or the power of the king with the briefing, and if the brevity was the equality of the words to be said: He has created us The best evaluation.The verse benefited that God has formed the human being a self -formation with what he created for him to numbers for his regime and his civilization, and he will not be the same.The one who is considered by God is up to the Almighty and not to be divided on him, as he does not affect him in the soul of the soul, and the goodness of others, and the righteousness in the land, and because it was the one who was the one who was Which is in the division with the tenderness and the Zayton and the developed of two years and the faithful country, but it is full of the arrest of the soul.He looks at your hearts.The satisfaction with God is the evaluation of the human perception and the correct view of the person; Because it is the one who exports the body of the body, as the body is a servant of the mind, so he was the intended of his saying: calendar).As for the creation of the person’s body in the best of the evaluation, it is not bound by the intention of the surah, and this appears like the talisman of the appearance in his saying: If the response is below the sins of the people of the people in the vicinity of the age to the purity of his strength, as it was pleased with him a lot It is more severe, and that is what is in which the righteousness of it (P-425) is the Samaid until he needs to confirm it by the oath, and it is indicated by his saying after) Because faith has the effect of the evaluation of the mind of the human being whom the path inspires in his work on the way of the sins, and the treatment of the children of his peaceful kind of one of them is the one who is the one who is good.According to their agreement with him in the truth, then that is the origin of the formation of the human being, if he is delivered from the symptoms of some of that, which is presented to him while he is a jinn; Either from a family that cares for the sickness of one of the two parents, or for the corruption of his entry from the fall or shock in his pregnancy, and what is presented to him after the birth of the father In it, he will take his mood, and he is distorted from his breakfast, such as the root of the Sandawi and the Sugarin, or the abundance of the eclipse, and from what he enters from the same habits The drinking of the drunkenness and the transcendence of the narcotic ones, from what he inherits at the length of his minds, or the condolences of his determination.And that we take from this verse that the human being is created in the case God is the type to describe its monuments, which is the full human innocence in its awareness of a straight awareness of what leads from the honest sensors, that is: the argument of the eager The constant about the same thing, with the reason for the peace of what the peaceful senses perform, and what the peaceful mind receives from that, and in which it is disgraced, in which it is the same Whereas, the righteous delivery and the oppressors and the diligent people and the rudimentary and the harmful thinking, or if it is not necessary for it to be overwhelmed by it With the truth of the right and the right, it was running in all the affairs of the righteousness, and when the righteous verbs were issued from it, but it may affect the dhul.For his desires and lusts, then threw it in the misguidance, or overlook the preachers of misguidance with the treatment of disagreement or the greed, so he will follow them as a vow or a vow, then it is not a good or a vow, then it is not.He will control what you imitate, so he will be used to him and forget the right and guidance.This meaning is interpreted by the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: “There is no birth except that it is born on the pharaoh, and then its parents are the ones that are used to it, or they will be supported.” The hadith, so that his father is the first to take care of his discipline and his trust, and they are the most obligatory people in his youth, so they are the ones who throw him in the first A peace from the misguidance of his father, so he walked with his breakfast, and then after that, a bid of a number of influences in it, if it is good, is good, and it is good, and it is good.(P-426) The Prophet ﷺ was paid to the two parents; Because they are the most powerful reasons for the illusion in their misguidance, and I am more urgent to their son.And the interpreters did not come to an interpretation of the interpretation of the evaluation of this great sense, so they shorten the evaluation of the good of the image.It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatada, Al -Kalbi, Abraham and Abi Al -Aali.Or on the resurrection.It was narrated from Ibn Abbas.Or on the youth and the guilt, and it was narrated from Akrama and Ibn Abbas.And the intended of the intention of the surah is only to be interpreted by the fact that the remembrance of a blessing on the human being reflected the human being, so he disbelieved in the blessing, and the soul is not.Attiyah on the authority of Al -Thalabi on the authority of Abu Bakr ibn Tahir that he said: The strengthening of the human being is his mind and his awareness, which we have visited him with the distinction, and he is the one who has been seen by This is with an increase: his eaten is in his hand, and what the pride has told about the deaf is that (the best of the calendar) is the most complete mind, understanding, literature, and knowledge.The verse is beneficial that the human being is breaking the good, and that in his mountains, the heart and the righteousness of itself and the seizures of what he thinks are void or destruction, and the love of the good, and the love of the good That is why you see it with justice and fairness, and it is advised by what he sees as a vulnerability to the best of others He is treated with goodness, and he is jealous of the weakening, and he will be bound by injustice as long as he is in the way of a romance that he will be brought to the soul of his soul, or his soul, or the same A healing of anger is in its chest, those symptoms are between it and between its hidden time, and it is fragmented into the words of the prejudice, the judgment, the righteous, the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, They stayed.If the bad desire is paved it, then it is decorated with it, the corrupting of the spoilers, and its response was unable And preaching to the preachers of the devotions in the hatred of that in the validity of the fancy governing his mind.(P-427) This is why the origin was in the good people, the equivalent, the guidance, and the goodness of the intention when a jurisprudence of jurisprudence and modernists.And the sentence (then we narrated it as a lower lower), given to the sentence (we created the human being in the best of the calendar), so it is in the matter of the oath.And the opposite in his saying: (we repeat it) is a hand to the human being, and the sacrificed scrubs will run in it.And (then) to benefit the arrogance of the arrogance as it is in the kindness of the sentence; Because the response is below those after its creation, it was desirable with the best of the strange evaluation of what is in it from the transfer of what is on it, and the absence of the situation is the case It was not, and because this sentence is the intended of the words to achieve that those who were acute from the fast became lower.The meaning: And we have come to the bottom of the sins or made it at the bottom of the signs.And the response is its fact: to return what was taken from a person or transferred from the position to what it was with, and the response is called a metaphor for the reason for the case of the case of the case.A metaphor sent by the relationship of release from the piety as it is here.And (below): the name is a preference, that is, the most luxurious, and added to (Saflalin), meaning: the Sufis of the Bafila.What is meant: lower people in the belief in his creation with the villages of his saying: (Except those who believe).The fact of the shower: the place of the place, and the release of a wide metaphor on the loss and the despondency in the same, as the lighter lower is a lift than others in its kind.And the sins: They are the lower of the belief, and the trace is below the belief, so it will be (the bottom of the two sins) secondly annexes to (we repel it) because it is a place that has become a good.The meaning: that the human being has changed the change of what was broken from the evaluation, which is faith in one God The deity of the carpentry and the dowry of the microscopic imitation of a cow, a crime, or two snakes, or from the tree of the poison, (P-428) or whoever calculates the time, is God, or the one who is more The stairs are equipped while witnessing his articles and feels the existence of himself.If you are tired with the side of the ethical, you saw The human being informs him of his degradation to the shelter of travel, so whoever lies if he was tired, and from scarcity if he is fond of it, and from the reward if he is afraid, and from the ritual, then you will be from the people For the gods and from the sins of the budget, and from the rises of the eliminating in the fire with the homes of their husbands, then after this from the slope of the ethics and the one who is in the ethics.And the chain of transmission to God is the highest of a metaphor, because it forms the high reasons and the system of its interaction and its metaphor in the sub -causes, until it connects to the reasons Fed and arrest the shadow to Him to the Almighty in his saying: (Did you not see to your Lord how to extend the shadow [Al -Furqan: 45]) to his saying: (Then we will hold him to us with a sake of the one who is in the way: 46) People said: The Emir built a city such.It is permissible to be (lowerly shed), that is, a place below what the sins dwells, and the addition of (lower) to (Saflalin) from the addition of the custody to the situation in it, By (we repeated) the incitement or on the risk of the rejectionists, that is: to the bottom of the two signs, and that is the house of torment as its saying: (The hypocrites are in the righteousness of the ritual [145] It is a slogan for the meaning of the elderly in a place that deserves it, and the chain of response to God is up to this face.And I think that his saying is up to the Almighty: (Then we narrated it as a lower one) On me, a holy day, and he said to me: Who is the lower money?I said: Whoever eats his debt, he told me: Who is the lower lower?I said: Whoever eats otherwise.He said: (Zah) and chest me (i.E.: (P-429), he struck my chest that means asking).And that the participants were below the slopes because they shade their arrogance and their hands, so they asked them the worship of idols to obtain their leaders.
