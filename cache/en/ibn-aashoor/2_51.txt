The researcher, when we prepared for four nights, then you took the hurry after him, and you are unjust and then forgive us from you after that, so that you may thank you The forgiveness of God from their great crime with the worship of others, and that of what their predecessors did, so the chain of transmission of those actions to the guerrilla of the addressees is what is the one Then our forgiveness from you, for that pardon is from the fathers of them and their children, and the sons must thank him, as it is presented to him.I was blessed with you [Al -Baqarah: 47] and it was located in the scouts, the interpretation of the Baghi and the interpretation of the whiteness that God and Moses promised him to give him the legitimacy after that he returned to the time Mahla, Pharaoh, and this is an illusion, because the children of the Israel are not (P-497), they return to Egypt's Egypt after their choices, how and the verses are clear that we were not.And that God would have given them the sanctified land that God has written for them and he referred in the scouts in the Surah of Smoke to the frequency in it and does not want to repeat it.And his saying, then you took the hurry after him, is the intended, and what was mentioned before it, it is a gift and a foundation for his sons and a man Pardoning God Almighty and his dream about them.And the recourse of the reminder of the pardon of this bad between the remembrance of the blessings of the male, the observance of the probation of its crops in the existence of the exodus, so that it will be done.Show the project.What is meant by the end of God is the matter of God, Moses, to cut off forty nights for the survivors of God Almighty and release the promise of this matter from where there is a good God and by giving the project.The readings of the vocabulary and our promise to a thousand after the waw on the form of the required effectiveness, the promise of the promise from two sides; The promise, the promise, and the reaction to the chapter, to the inventory of the confirmation of the limit of the traveler and the well -being of God, and the path of the sick and the murderer of God, so that it will be a metaphor in the verbal.It requires the release of the verb from two actions, so if it is removed from its door, the rest of the repetition is just from the same view of the act And investigator, so that it will be in the home of the righteous confirmation.The most famous is that the diligent of what was mostly the same is the one who is in the midst of the two sides.As it was located in the hadith of the migration and its signs of a ritual.And the poet said: “Its promotions were made by the money or the usury between them, and it was used here, because the survival and the spoke are the closeness, so it is the closeness of the ritual.The settlement, and for that, I seek refraining from the remembrance Difficulty.The reaction was said to its chapter in the ability that God and Moses promised him to give him the law and command him to attend the path The two parties, and that is sufficient in the correction of the reaction by cutting the view from the choice of the promises with it, and that does not contradict the reaction because the building of the form of the reaction is from Two aspects, especially if the comment is not mentioned in the memorizer, as it is here to purchase the briefing of the boss to intend Those who address it, for this speech is a marketer for reminding, not for the news and the memory, in which it is satisfied with the least sign, so the deletion and the remembrance are satisfied.(P-498) Abu Amr, Abu Jaafar, and Jacob (and our promise) read a thousand hoops of waw on the truth.And Moses is the Messenger of God to the children of Israel and the owner of the project of Al -Tawarah, and he is Musa ibn Amran, and he did not remember the name of his grandfather Ben Yaqoub.He was born in Egypt in the same year of a thousand and five years before the birth of Jesus.And when his mother gave him, he was afraid of him that he would take him, and they would kill him because he was in the days and his birth.As he came with his saying, they will sacrifice your children [Al -Baqarah: 49], so the king of Egypt commanded to kill every male that is born in the children of Israel, Specified Lawy, and her husband had died when she was Moses, and she referred to his hide from the dat And I put it in a woven wretch from the wickedness of the Baridi, and it was broken by the temptation and the bituch, so that the water will not enter it and put it in the child and throw it in the Nile in the Nile in the Nile in the Nile Pharaohs on the shore of the Nile and entrust a sister whose name is Maryam that the one that the Nile will throw in it and what is made by it and what is it in it and what is it.A closer is the Pharaoh of the second eye, and when the river carried it, the daughter of Pharaoh, the name of the name, was a thief with a neighborhood for it to walk on the righteousness And justification in its hundred, it was said that they were in the city of Ain Shams.The daughter of Pharaoh to her mother, and Mary, the sister of Moses himself for the son of Pharaoh, appeared.Labor, I go to my feet and pray for her to breastfeed?So I said yes, and she went and came to Moses's mother.And the woman of Pharaoen took the boy and built it and called it Mushi, it is said that it is a compound from the word (Mo) in the sense of water and the word (something) in the sense of the sake The Arabian Moses, and the appearance is that this name is compounded by the transit language, not from the dome, so perhaps he had another name in the palace of Pharaoh.And Moses grew up in the house of Pharaoen as a child.And when he grew up, he did not know that he is not the son of Pharaoh, and that he is my broom, and perhaps his mother teach him with this and made him the signs of him, and he will be blessed with him, The weak and Moses was a strong structure, and when he reached the most severe and thirty and thirty of his age, he spoke to him, a heat, who was killed in which he was killed, in which he was killed, and a prestige of a prestige and a ritual That was after his parties to the palace of Pharaoh, that is, after the death of his educators, so Moses feared that he would be brought up from him and migrated from Egypt and passed in a migrant in the migrant Shuaib, then he came out of the city after ten years, and his age is a nose and four years.(P-499) And God revealed to him on his way to remove the children of Sarayel from Egypt and save them from the injustice of Pharaoh, so he entered Egypt, and his brother met his brother He sought to leave the children of Sarayel from Egypt, with what God has cut in his book, and his abandonment was in the sons of Sarayel from Egypt in the limits of the year 1460 six years and four years of age The second purpose of the second, and Moses, peace be upon him, will pass away on the mountains of Nibo, 1380 eight, three and three, and a thousand before the birth of Jesus, and the burial of you It is known for anyone as it is the text of Al -Tawara.Forty nights said that he was a disagreement for the attachment to our promise, which is the return of the release in it, this is the disobedience to the one who is attached to the one who is in any way.We are made, and we are the most promising of the reaction.The release of the name of time on what falls in it is a great metaphor in the words of the abolition and from it and fear a day that does not reward a soul [Al -Baqarah: 48] as it was presented and the things that were made.A night of knowledge of the addressees who remember her with the incest of pain to her.And when we were released in his saying, when we prepared for four nights, we would seek me from the development and moderations that were running in the words of the writers here, from the face of it.The face, which we have ever collected.And he made the meeqaat for my life because their account was in the moon.And the whole of you, you took the wheel after it with a letter, then the one who is in the kindness of the sentence of the Tartibi historical screams of the point of pointing to the formation of this way in the shadows of this Then our forgiveness from you after that is also for my crime, the arrival of the great pardon for the greatness of their generosity, so that it is the most brilliant.Things in goodness and against him alert him On the greatness of the mercy of God with them before disobedience and after it, and the second act of the verb, you would have taken it to his appearance and his knowledge of his knowledge and his knowledge of his knowledge and his knowledge of his knowledge The worshipers, or God, and with it, the appearance of a male (after him) to the increase in the disgrace that they were new to their awaiting the law that is not like the project, which is not like that Their followers of what they were from the neutrality and the yoghnas in the blessings of God Almighty, and that they were new ones with the convergence of the whisper They saw his miracle, and after that he forbade them from his servants, when they said to him, make us a god as they have gods, he said that you are people who are ignorant of [138].And the extension of the remembrance of “from” to the indication that the struggle has started from the first time of the distance of the absence of the absence of peace be upon him (P-500), and this is also a strange condition because the matter The covenant is after the length of the absentee on the one that is a weakness in the covenant, as Al -Harith said that Bin Kalla said: “When I know that they will be seized, the one who does not have the same After him), a few and their deaths are brought up in the memorization of the era of Moses.And he said after him, after that, after his absence, and the addition of the added with (after) added to the name of the one who talks about it is great in the words of the Arab It means it from the place, so it is more than that it is intended after the death, as in the saying of it, you will not be sent by God, then God will not send a messenger from him.[34] Israel after Moses [Al -Baqarah: 246].Etining and the calf was sanctified with them and they represented the greatest of the gods with them with a human being from a copper of which has a veil sitting on the authority of his hurry As we have been hugging something that they were hugging, and they were protecting him with the fire from a hole under his chair, and people did not neglect it, so they would bring him closer to him They are young as young, so if the roll is placed on his arm, they fell out, so they thought that, the matter of acceptance of the kinship, then it is obligatory for their ignorance and what they believe.He was called with them and maybe his name (Molok) and they are a high nation that was seduced and her alms likewise like a language and the people of the Arab They said to Moses, make us a god as God had the gods, so Moses fell them up and they were afraid of him, so when he went to the survivors and was used to them, Aaron was disturbed by them.They took the calf, which they made from the gold and silver from their sweetness and worship it.And you say it, and you are unjust, a restricted state, so that you would be taken to be the conjunction with the darkness from its principle to its end.And the extension of the situation is the notice of the obedience of their excuse as they made, And that they do not be interpreted in the worship of the hurry, or because they were the time of their establishment in Egypt’s Egypt, to the murder With the cultivation of the neutrality, then their resignation to the trace, after a messenger had come to them.So they were unjust in this manufacturer, a double injustice.Taking the wheel (P-501) is an injustice, so there is no case with it signed.After this, I was informed of Sheikh Muhammad ibn Arafa al -Tunsi, so I found it.And he said it, then our forgiveness from you after that is the place of the year and its compassion by this, for my crime, the arrangement of this pardon, in that it is greater than all of you So in the increase of the age, the intended of the words is the one who is given to the same, and what was previously said of his saying, and when we are prepared for four nights, etc.; It is a gift to him and a description of what he has been exalted with this pardon from the great sin.And after that, there is a restriction of our pardon for pardon, admiration for him, that is, it is a pardon if it is obtained after that, the sin of the greatness, and the greatness With our forgiveness until it is said that then it was indicated with it, so it is a certainty of the consequences of the consequences, then the late pardon in it and the purity of its champions, and the essence of its champions.His saying that is associated with the admiration of the one who has the speech of the group, because that is because it is more than the names of the signal, seeking to the individuals; As the rhetoric of the individual is more prevalent, it is used for the discourse of the collection, as it was alerted that the kaf has come out of the intention of the speech to the meaning of the distance and the same in the words of this Disenation and collection are two things that are unlike the original, only when they are aware of them, so if it is not intended to be intended to help them, then the destiny to them is the choice.And his saying that you may thank you, please, to obtain your thanks, and adjust the mother of the illness as a gesture until their thanks with that is something that is overwhelmed Please without the letters of illumination from the rhetoric of the rhetoric.God Almighty has his saying, O people, worship your Lord [Al -Baqarah: 21] to his saying that you may fear and the meaning of the thank you is presented in the saying [Al -Fatihah: 2] Al -Ghazali has a righteous door that is adjacent to his remembrance of his height.
