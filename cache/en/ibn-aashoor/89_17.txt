The Quranic researcher does not honor the yatim, and do not embrace the food of the poor, eat the heritage, and you love money.(Pic) is a transitional, and the appropriateness between the two of the agrees, which is transmitted from it and the transmission to it is the appropriateness of the opposite to the two guarantees (so he will be honored and we will come from it [15]) That the blessing of their money and the capacity of their lives is a crime of God for them, so God warned them that if God honors them, then they did not honor his servants, for the sake of his servants.From the glory of their money, and when they increase the money, they do not need it, and that is to refute to take pride with generosity and vinegar.The sentence (do not honor the orphan) is numerous as it is required by the damage, so it is either the exile, the words of words, or the symptoms between (all) and its sister as it will come.And the honor of the Yatim: the dam of its disagreement and the goodness of its treatment because it is the suspicion of the need for the lack of his family, and for their accommodation on the money that the fathers leave.The money was in the ignorance of the heads of the family.(P-333) The righteousness is because it is the suspicion that the choice of the thoughtful is to feel it by the lack of someone who denotes it.Al -Yatim: The boy whose father died, and he was presented in the wall of the women, and his definition of the Persians, meaning: Do not honor the orphans, as well as the definition of the poor.And the exile of the urbanization on the food of the poor is a denial of its food with the first way, which is the indication of the content of the speech, meaning: for the few legacy of the poor, and they do not benefit.Bless him to benefit them with the custody of their money.And (food) is permissible to be a name in the sense of the feed, with the ability: they do not embrace the food of the poor, so he added it to the poor, to the one who is the one who is the one.That the name of the source is a feed, and the meaning: and do not embrace the food of the riches, the poor, so add it to the poor from adding the source to the verb.And the poor: the poor, and it was presented in the wall of light.In the verse, I was brought up because they were denying their honor, and it was done with the negation of being incubated by the food They embrace the guardians of the orphans on that, and they know that they do not feed the poor of their money.It is permissible for urbanization to be a feed food; Because whoever urges something that is willing to wear it, then if he can do it, then he will do it, and from him, he said: [Asr: 3]) That is: Do the right, be patient and support them.And read the vigor (do not honor, do not embrace, eat, and love) with the rhetoric of the rhetoric on the rhetoric of the way of the fools of the rituals of the one who says: His Lord [Al -Fajr: 15]) The verses of the intention of their confrontation with the time, and it is in the face of it In unseen.And Abu Amr and Jacob read it with the absence of the absence to the definition of the Prophet ﷺ and the Muslims with this sacrifice for their sacrifice: (I say that I have money, money, [Al -Balad: 6] And the generosity read: (And do not embrace) by the guarantee of the Harm of urbanization, and it was read by Asim and Hamza (P-334), Al-Kisa’i, Abu Jaafar and Khawal (Tahdar) Some of them are menstruating, and the origin of it (you are inconvenient), and one of the two times was deleted to reduce the lightness, that is: you fill the leaving the urbanization on the one.And heritage: the money is the maworth, that is: the one who is left behind by the man after his death for his heir, and his origin: he is an inheritance of Wawa in his first with a bouquet of the one who is a matter Like the thickness, and the wreckage, it was shown, and it is not a measure, as they did in a direction, dumbness, accusation, and semi -semi.Eating: It is a slight of the intended to be an interest that is not left from it, and I think that this is the slogan from the Holy Quran, as I did not stand in the same way.The heritage is compensated by the addition to it.That is, the heritage of orphans, as well as the people of the ignorance, were forbidden to women and the young people from the money of their inheritance.And I feel his saying: (You eat) that what is meant is the heritage that has no right in it, and it appears the face of an infringement that the heritage is not said: Because the heritage is money, its owner died and its eating requires that this money be entitled to the dissolution of his money for a minor or a junior.And the pain: gathering, and describing the elderly with it and describing the source of the exaggeration, i.E., the custodian of the money of the inheritors to the money of the eaters, such as the saying of the Almighty: and do not eat.And the darling: the many, it is said: the water is in the basis, if it is more, and a beautiful well with the opening of the gym: the many water, that is: a lot of love, and the description of the love with the abundance; Because love is one of the psychological suffering, it does not describe the many that is the abundance of the number of gender.Jam is a slightness of the meaning of strong strong, that is: excessive love, and that is the place of the love of the love of money; Because the individuals of his love falls in the cooking of his acquisition of the means other than the right, such as the branch, the severity, the stolen, and the eating of the trusts.
