The Quranic researcher (so do not storm the obstacle and what I know is what is the punishment, so it is a nickname or a food on a day with a desirability that is close to a close or a tranquet with a tranquil And they are in patience and they are in patience and the mercy.The two methods did not get the incorporation of the successor to the good.He urged the obstacle).In the kinship and the vitality of the domination of the neck and the elimination of the poor in the time of the fence, the spending in that is not hidden from people, disagreeing with what he claims to spend.By the time you are disturbed (no), if it is (no), if you enter the action of the past, and you were not confused to be for the supplication, unless it is repeated with it, like it, like it.We say it: (Do not believe or pray [the resurrection: 31]), or it was (no).Without a supplication, and she was not disturbed by being disgraced by her forcibly (what) after it, and he (stated the obstacle), joining two things that came to them in his saying: Feeding), as if he said: He does not have a neutral, nor is it a good or poor.As it was said: I do not storm the punishment or safe.The contract of this is the one who is in the face of this day, which is the one who has gone.A position in it.Restore the row, and it is an abuse of the significance of the cost, such as the acquisition, and the likeness of the cost of the righteous works by flying the obstacle in his severity, he said, and he said.Humanity: (And what is met by those who have been patient with: 35).The benefits, as he said: ؎ and the fresh freshness of the crowd, and the exile of the referendum reported that it was amended from the distress in order to hurry up to the sake of the sake, and to the time The obstacle.The two help, the punishment, and the recklessness, and the built of it on each other, and that is one of the best of the borrowing, and it is a building on its suspicion of the mind.(P-357) The speech is a marketer, the stake-up of the stake on the extent of these righteousness of righteous tanks with the reasons for the appetite from the awareness and the region.And his saying: (And what I realize what is the obstacle) is a state of (the obstacle) in his saying: (So do not proceed to the obstacle) for his intention and that it is for its negligence asking for it What is, that is: the obstacle was not immersed in the event of its newness that it is preserved, and this identification benefits the division to the knowledge of what is meant by the obstacle.And (what) is the first.And (what) are the second.And appreciation: Any thing I know what is the punishment, that is: you know this answer, as a matter of this, a dear thing that needs someone who knows you.And the discourse in (what I realize) is a certain eye; Because this is the example of the ideal.And the verb (Adrak) is attached to the work in the two acts of the fact that it is after it, and its counterpart may be presented in the right surah.Nafaa, Ibn Amer, Asim, Hamza, Abu Jaafar, Jacob, and successor read, (dismantling a neck) by lifting (jaw) and added it to (a nickname) and raised (and raised) (Fak).And the sentence of (the dismantling of a nickname) is a bayyan for the punishment, and the estimation: it is the jaw of a neck, so the chain of transmission is deleted to it by the follow -up of the recovery.And the obstacle of the obstacle is that it is: (dismantling a neck or food) is based on the urbanization of the hardships of the stray righteous tanks.And you have learned that this is from his minds, who is a sensual, so there is no face to be able to be able to be able to add to an addition, and he said: That is: I do not realize what the obstacle is improved.And Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr and Al -Kisa’i (dismantled) read it with the opening of the way to do the action of the past, and the stabilization (nickname) on the verb of the verb (or) A thousand after the eye (food) on the fact that it is a long -standing action on (jaw), so you will be a sentence (the dismantling of a neck) with a boundary of the rhetoric (so no) Compensation, or be a substitute for a sentence (proceed the punishment), that is: do not proceed to the obstacle, nor dismantle a neck or a feed.And what is between them, as it was reported.(P-358) and the jaw: Take the thing from the hand of those who are distinguished by it.The neck is intended by the human being, from the release of the name of the part on all of it, such as the release of a head, eye and direction, and the arousal of the memorization of the neck here; Because what is meant is the same as the captive or the servant, and the first of what is dangerous to them is the view of these aspects of these is his neck; Because in the majority, he is documented from his neck.The jaw was released on the elimination of the one in the families or king, because of the liking of the disgraceful matter by removing the tendency of the blessed hand.This verse is a origin of the origins of Islamic legislation, which is the voices of the street to freedom, and we have said in that in the book of the fundamentals of the regime Inception in Islam.And the desired: hunger, and it is a source of the weight of the act, like: praise and the mercy, from the disbelief of the disbelief if it is hungry.And what is meant by (a day with desired): time, not the known day.And the addition of (Dhi) to (desired) benefits the choice of that day with the justice, that is: the day of the famine.That is the time of the cold and the time of drought.And the face of specializing the day, which is desirable for food in it, is that people are in the time of the famine, their scarcity is tired of money, the fear of the time of the veil.Food in that time is better, and it is the punishment and without the obstacle is a varying escalation.(Yatime) was affected by the verb with it (food), which is a source of action that does its work, and the tanks of the source are not added, or the knowledgeable, if the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same More, and the Kufic prevented the source of the source, which is not added.And what was returned after it is a light or a bore that they made on the perpetrator of the verb of the export, so it is estimated in the same way as this verse with them (it is good).And Al -Yatim: The person who has no father and he is without the eloquence, and the face of his specialization by food is that he thinks that the lunch of the lip He depends on him, and his life from exposure to seek what he needs; So he was desired in his food, even if the domestication (P-359) was not reached and the poverty and described it as a (close), that is: close to the ruler; Because this description confirms its feed; Because there is a relief in his place, and in his aspect of food, and in his being a relative of mercy.The closeness: the relative of the proportions, which is a source of an effective age, such as what was presented in (desired).And the poor: the poor, and it is presented in the wine of the cow when it is the Almighty saying: (And on those who are restricted by the ransom of the food For a mask, the ravaged was made a brand on the argument according to the knowledge.And the raised is a source of the weighing of an effective and its verb (raising), it is said: raised, if he sleeps on the dust, that is: he did not have what he is overwhelmed with the righteousness The Arabs are from the clothes that turn between the body and the land with the rocks and the shadow, and the close of it is their saying in the supplication: I raised you, and raised you.And (or) to divide, which is the meaning of my suffering (or) came from the benefit of the selection.And know that if the person is intended for the human beings, that is, the participants were exiled, so the neck and the food were disturbed by the abandonment of their sins with the righteousness of Islam; Because breaking the neck and feeding the hungry from the relatives that Islam came from the food of the hungry and the holes, and in which it suffers from the inspection of the partners that they are the one who loves the people, but they love the And the pleasure of themselves with this, or for the goodness Own, meaning: is the food that God is satisfied with; Because there is the benefit of those who need it.And the same as your ethics in the hands and the dead and the call that does not come back to the benefits of the baptists; Because that obedience was inviting them to the people of the grandfather without needing to food, but they want to be obedient or proud.In the hadith of a Muslim, “The evil of the food is the food of the wild, it is forbidden by those who come to it and claim to it whoever refuses it.” " If what is meant by one person is one, it is permissible for the meaning to be the same as what is presented, and it is permissible to be a defamation of him with the pain and the liar of the liar, and the liar, and the liability of the (P-360) There is a wide work for its people before Islam, so he was not sung in a captive jaw, or is taken with blood or from the freedom of a slave.Whatever it is not in the verse is a sign of that God has assigned the partners in this nearby nor that he punished them for their blessings The disbelievers with the branch of the law, which is the question of a few seriousness and its imposition here is the least luminous.And the sentence (then it was one of those who believed) is a compassion for a sentence (so do not preserve the obstacle).And (then) to the arrogant cries, it indicates that the two sentences of the premium in it are the most prestigious arrangement in the presumed The estimation of the words: Do not storm the punishment with the dismantling of a neck or a food after its believer.And in the verb (he) is a notice that his faith was the preservation of the obstacle that is required in it with the way to be wrapped in its exclusion from it.He turned (then it was one of those who believed) on the validity of the time and the vilification is beneficial that this class is from the people, or this person who is not the one who is not the one who is the one who is not.He was blamed for what he had overwhelmed, because his faith is overwhelmed, and that if he did something of these good works, and it was not among those who believed in what we have done.Because the great luck of the righteous has been exempt from it, as it was indicated by it (then) from the arrogance, then it is permissible that it is a condition in the most expensive.And on the authority of Aisha, "she said: O Messenger of God, the son of Judaan was in the ignorance, the mercy arrives, feed the food, and the suffering of the suffering, and the picnic of the neck - He wants to get closer - so does anything benefit it?He said: No; He did not say a day: Lord, forgive me my sin on the Day of Religion.It is understood from the verse by the understanding of the adjective (those who believed) that if he did this near in the ignorance and believed in God when the Islam came to him, then the work of it.And whoever makes (then) is useful for the cries in time, makes the meaning: No.Restore the obstacle and follow it with faith.That is, proceed to the obstacle in the ignorance and converted to what Islam came.This came openly in the hadith of Hakim bin Hizam in Al -Saheeh.”He said:“ I said: O Messenger of God, you saw things that I used to have in the ignorance of the ignorance of the ritual (P-361) A merciful, so is it a reward for it?And the Prophet said to me: You greeted the goodness of the good.And chanting: worship, meaning: that his entry into Islam benefited from giving reward for his work as if he did it in Islam.And he said: (Whoever believes) without saying: Then he was a believer; Because it is one of those who believed in the evidence of faith from the description of a believer; Because the group of the group is stronger for the sake of the many who are described by it, the many good is better, as it is presented in his saying: (He said: I seek refuge in God) The cow surah, then in this verse is another strengthening for the description, and he made it with the person who feels that they were known to know the faith between the faith.And he was attached to (believe) to know him, that is: they believe in God alone and with His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ and the religion of Islam.The verb was made like the person who is suspended.And also to come from the remembrance of those who believed in the righteousness of them with their saying: (And they will be patient with patience and support the mercy) Maintenance.He specialized in the remembrance of the believers, whom they pray for patience and their consistency of the Rahma; Because that is the honor of their attributes after faith, the patience is the angel of good things all; Because it does not leave the custodian of the Nahsan lust, and that is from patience.And the merciful, the angel of the Islamic college, said: (Rahma among them [Al -Fath: 29]).And the consistency of mercy is a great way, and it is also a softening of their equity in the mercy; Because whoever recommends the mercy is the one who recognized her destiny and preferred it, then he does it before he recommends it as it was presented in his saying: (And do not embrace the food).And in it is an illness that the people of the evil are not among the people of patience, nor from the people of the merciful, and it was stated in that in the saying of the Almighty: (And whoever is good and said: I am one of the Muslims [Chapter: 33]) to his saying: (And what he meets except those who are patient [Chapter: 35]) [Dawn: 18]).
