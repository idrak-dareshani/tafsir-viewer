The Quranic researcher, those who believe, if you condemn a religion to a name that is named, then write it and write among you a writer with justice and does not refuse a writer to write it.And let him pray for the truth, and may God fear his Lord and do not underestimate anything from him.Just.When the Qur’an is concerned with the regime of Muslims in their mothers, then it started with what has their general in their general condolences of the poor and the relief of the manifestation, and it is clear For the one who is considered, then the warning of it (P-98) was cautious about the suspects of those who need to seek the suspicion of usury with what is in these transactions from the consequences of the Money from martyrdom, and what does his place is the mortal and the dead, and if you determine the trust in the customs of the greatest and means of broadcasting trust between the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones The contracts of the transcripts and the dolls of the domain.The sentence is a premature exile, and the appropriateness in the resignation is a phenomenon of the punishment of speech on the deception of the people of usury.And the conversion is one of the largest reasons for the customs of the customers, because the one who is stated in the development of money may be destroyed by money, and he is obliged to disperse to show its talents in the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader, or the trader.And because the traveler may turn the money from between his hands and before him, after time The identifier among them is not to think that the deprivation of usury and return of those who deal with the heads of their money are heroes for all of it, and he benefited from that of the time At the other hand, it is the documentation of it with writing and strictness.And the speech is directed to the believers, that is, for their group, and the intended of it is the special of the two consequences, and the most special thing is the one who is the one who is the right of the right The mind is on his money, so the stakeholder is required to ask for the writing, even if the creditors are not asked, and this is taken from what God has told in the surah of the stories, on the authority of Musa Moses, when they are on the authority of the garden and the suffering of its sake, Moses said, and God is on what we say and an attribute [Al -Qasas: 28] So this is a testimony of himself for his souls.That.And the conversion is a reaction, and it is released here with the fact that the verb is shocked by one side and it is the authority of the predecessor, because you say that Dannad is from it, so it is the effect of it.The group of the nation, because in the group, a debt and a debt of a debt became the group, they were divided on two sides, and for you to make the reaction on the other hand, as it is as it is.And the increase in the entry of “Beddin” either for the jungle of the jungle, as they say: I saw it with my eyes and its touch in my hand, or to be a return To the guarantee in his saying (they wrote it) and had it not been for his remembrance, he said: So write the debt and not.The systems are with that good, and because it is the father of the religion of religion into a deferred and a condition, he said it in the scouts.(P-99) Al-Tayyibi said of the owner of Al-Farid: It is possible to think that the endowment is used as a metaphor in the promise, as the saying of Raoubah: Some of his saying: (Bedouin) mentioned a payment of the delusion of the metaphor, and the religion in the words of the Arabs is the most recent.Their poet said: We promised them a paint and a hurry barbecue, and it is not a debt and its saying: To a name called, asking for the deadlines of the deadlines to the people of the people in the The constants, the promotion of the legitimacy of the abuse in the legitimacy of the registration.The term is a period of time, the end of the end, making a cure for a work that is not required in which the initiative is in it, for the desire to do that, or the work In during it.The term is a name and is not a source, and the exploitation is the one, which is to give the sake of the sake, and the meaning of the expansion in the work, the sake of the laterness is released, and it is the last, and it is in the last, If they are their age and say it: until the book is attained for its sake [Al -Baqarah: 235].The name is distinguished by its characteristic, which distinguishes it from what it is similar in its gender or its type The limitations, but it is intended to be neutralized by the one who is known to the people, so that it is likened to the neutrality of the position of the name of the name.He distinguished him from his lords, except for that, so he was released to him for the memorization It only is for a sake, so what is meant is from the description of the debt with this description, it is the description of a term named as a integration of the matter with the suffering of the sake of the sake.And his saying: Bedouin to a name that is called every debt: from the loans, from the sales or otherwise, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that it was descended in the peace - the meaning of the peace of the The ideals are in the seller of the seller if it is to be a period of time - and the peace is one of the customs of the people of the city, and the meaning of his words is that the sale of peace is the reason for the revelation of the verse, The special cause is not allocated.(P-100) and the matter in (so write it).[Al -Baqarah: 283] Including the meaning of the starlets.It was said: The matter is for the duty, Ibn Jarraj, Al -Sha’abi, Ata and Al -Nakhwi said, and it was narrated from Abu Saeed Al -Khudayri, and he is the saying of David, and his choice is to the one who is the one who said: The following is when he said: And they martyred two martyrs from your men.Writing, and his saying: If some of you are safe, some of you [Al -Baqarah: 283] is a specialization for the generalities Declaration in their phrases.And the intention of the matter with the book of trusting the right and cut the causes of the deeds, and the organization of the nation’s transactions, and that it can be acquired on the corrupt and the most common, and the most likely It is the origin of the matter, and you have confirmed this confirmation, and that his saying: If some of you are safe from one [Al -Baqarah: 283] the verse.A special privilege in the case of the honest between the two sides, as it comes - because the state of the guys is a negative condition of the purity of the tanner The reasons for the rituals and the opposite, so the documentation is required for them in the shrines of the struggle, so that they would not be lenient, then they will lead to the ritual in the barrier, and it is in the punishment, and it is for me In denial of the embarrassment of the creditors if he asks from his debt, the books are not required until the debt is no longer from the misfortune of it, for it is in the two guerrillas.And Ibn Attiyah said: The correctness is the one who is obligatory, because the woman has this right to give and leave it with unanimity, so how is it obligatory for him to do it, but it is for him, Words may be promoted in the opinion of the opinion, but it is the opposite that the shrine of trust is not the place of rises.And the intention of the project is alerted by the people of the rights until they are not easier, then they will sleep, and the intended is not the heroes of some of them, as well The deception of his creditor, if he knows that he is from God and from its intentions, cut the causes of the symptoms.And his saying: They wrote it, including two state One of them is with it denies his trust by writing the other.(P-101) and the second: the case of a third book that is intermediaries between them, so he writes what is contracted with him and witnesses a witness and he will be delivered by the owner of the owner of the right.One of them, and this is the majority of the Arabs when we descend the verse, so the illiterate among them was fascist, but the writer was in the wicked and the wicked, and some of them Low from Mecca and Medina.And his saying: Let a writer write among you a justice for the two years, that they should take a writer who writes among them because they are the same.Doing the matter to the writer is exaggerated in the matter of the two who are hidden by the conquest, and the Arabs intend to the intended, so it will bring it down to the liquefaction of the way in the way As they said about the matter: Let your son be a vibration, and in the end: Do not forget what I have commanded, and I do not know you do so.So the student’s action is a kind (among you) And this is not an order for the writers, and the matter of the writer is his saying: A writer does not refuse to write as God has taught him, let him write.And his saying: “With justice”, that is: the truth, and the justice is here in the sense of the elevation that the witness describes, and it is said: A man is just, because the one who does not have the same The following saying: Let him be borne with justice.Therefore, the interpreters are short of his saying: (So write it) on the authority of a writer, other than those who are used to him because he is the majority, and he will be punished by his saying: A clearer of justice, as it is like a two -year -old (so write it).On the fact that the writings of the two disabilities, if they improve it, take the melody of the speech or its districts.Therefore, the verse was a pilgrimage when the scholars ’gathering of the sacrifice of the rituals is in line, for if the writer is being blocked, it is beneficial to the rule of his line.And his saying: A writer does not refuse to write an end to whom the writing is required of the two who are the ones who are from the abstinence of it if he is called to it, then this is a good To say to him and to write a writer among you, just because you knew a nose from the time of that, a ruling directed to the two years, and this is the one who has been lost, and this is the time We are forbidden, so who is called to be written among the two consequences, he is forbidden by abstinence, and on it, the answer is for the book, the custody of the eyes, and it is the one who says: (P-102) And al-Tabiri, who is not to be adjusted from it, and it was said: Rather, the answers are required, and a sinner is a sinner if it is not in the position except for one writer, so if it is one, then it is one of it On the sufficiency, which is the saying of goodness, and it is meaning that it is a dignity to their religion, because if they fill in the abuse, they will be all, and if it is said: It is a matter He knows the book from the people of the place of the two weighing, and it is appointed to the appointment of the one who is a trustworthy, one of them is a good, and the right to seek the relocation of the one who is the one An enforcement.It was said: It is obligatory for the writer in the event of his emptiness, the dam said, and it was said: He is a breeze with his saying: There is no composition of a writer or martyr, and he is the saying of the laughter, The presence of the book between the two raids is not harmful except in a bright and ranked conditions, such as the place of the two weakens from the place of the writer, and on the authority of the people and the son of the son Hasak, with his words, after this: If some of you are safe, then he will be fulfilled who believed his safety [Al -Baqarah: 283] and we will come to us.And on this disagreement, it is different in the reward for the reward for the writing between the two raids, because if it is a duty, then it will not be rewarded for it, otherwise the reward is permissible.And it is attached to the convergence in which the documentation is required by writing and martyrdom, and the words will come to the ruling of the testimony of the testimony, and there is no saying.And his saying: As God has taught him, meaning: a book that is similar to what God has taught to write it and what is meant by the similarities, not the comparison, so it is the same as what I say, then what is the same [Al -Baqarah: 137] The adequate is the position of the absolute active; Because it is a row for a deleted source and (what) is a connection.And the meaning of “what God has taught” is that he writes what he believes and does not cd or be confused, because God has not known except the truth and he is the one who is stable in the innocence of the human being They will change and change, and that is not the same as that God has taught them, and this indicates to him the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: It is permissible for the sufficiency to be for the metaphor of the thing with its reward and the compensation for its compensation, that is, to write a book that is rewarded with the knowledge of God, that the book of God is good Thank you for the facilitation of God (P-103), the reasons for its knowledge, but this thank you will write that what is in it is written in the memorization The meaning of the explanation, as it is in the words of the Almighty: and I do well as God has improved to you [Al -Qasas: 77] and his saying: And remember him as he guided you [Al -Baqarah: 198].And enough for this is either a deputy from the absolute, or a row of a verb with it, deleted on the interpretation of the source of the reaction of the one who is the one who is written, The face is a source, and on both directions, it is attached to his saying: The interpretation of the verse.And his saying: “Let him write” a separation on his saying: A writer does not refuse while he is a preacher with the necessity You are sure of the matter and the affirmation of the forbidden as well.Hope: “They took it after his saying: and the people of Moses took it after their hip, as a hurry.[Al -A'raf: 148].And his saying: He will be mortated with whom the truth is dictated and dictated two languages: the first is the language of the people of Hijaz and the sons of Asad, and the second is a language of Tamim, and the Qur’an came to them.The truth is upon him and said: It is dictated with him with a deception and an authenticity [Al -Furqan: 5] They said: The origin is the mortality and then the pain was shown, so that it is the most lone Al -Bazi, as it is: The meaning of the two people is to meet a words on his sake to write it from it, so, so he made it easy in the tongue and the dictionary, and it is a shortage in the interpretation that it is that it is the right of it.This verse mentioned in the custody of the book, otherwise it is the saying of the exalted in the surah of the parts, so it dictates that it is a deception and an asset [Al -Furqan: 5] For the sake of writing and the presentation of novel and transmission as in The verse of the differences, and for the sake of preservation, as it is said that the polite is on the boy, and it is a way to keep the blind, so the freedom of the phrase is that these are the ones who are exposed.With the meeting of words to write about it, to narrate, or to be preserved, and (the right) here: what has the right to the creditors have the right.And in this matter is a lesson for the martyrs, for those who write in the paths of confusion and the like, what the witnesses have not been blamed on them, unless he has been over.In it, he trusted his right or stopped him before his contract on the sixth.(P-104) and the two guarantees in his saying: “Let him fear” and his saying: He does not underestimate him, he is entitled to return to the one who has the truth; Because it is the closest one to the two of the two guerrillas, that is: the Lord of the debt is not deficient in the time of the rituals.The creditors are absent, and for me that this is far away, as there is no excess of this commanding, and if the debtor is hidden something or was stupid, because the Lord of the Lord is forced to do so For his words, the Almighty is: Let him write between you and be able to return to the two guerrillas to (a writer) with a century that this forbidding is more attached to the writer, for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a good one He fell on him.And the guarantee in his saying (from him) is a leader to the truth and it is a right to all the two years, so if something is lost from it, it is harmful to one of them, there is no referral, and this is a brief.And underestimation, it was pleased by the people of the language by deficiency, and it appears that it is more special than the deficiency, so it is a deficiency with concealment, and the closeness of the righteousness to the meaning of the rituals, the son of the rulings, in the sake of the Lacking in the tongue of the Arabs is the deficiency of the ritual and the defamation, or the deception of the value, or the imbalance in the increasing in the whole, or the deficiency of it, that is, from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from it, that is: It is appropriate in the sense of the verse; Because what is forbidden from the deficiency of the right is to be overlooked by his owner, and for that we are forbidden by the witness or the debt The people are disgraced [Al -A'raf: 85].And his saying: If the right to the right is, or the weakness of the shed is the disagreement of the mind, and he was presented with his saying: “He will say:” The small weak, and it was presented with his words, the Almighty: He has a weak offspring [Al -Baqarah: 266].And who is not able to tire is the one who is the one who is with you with you, blindly, and all silent.And the face of the affirmation of the guerrilla that is in the verb of the “tire of the“ prominent ”is the guidance of his saying, so let him be given to him, so that he will not be deluded.On the authority of him, he was obliged to testify to him with what they are doing, and the guardian was before Islam and in his chest the greatness of the kin To be tired of the father, the commander, and the tribe of the tribe, and in the hadith (p-105), and he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said to them: The kiss.And the meaning of “justice”, that is, the truth, and this is an indication that the will of the commander and the submitted in the right of the one who is over is a past if he appears because of his reason, but he did not do the For the sacrifice of the fear of the vastness of the weakening money.* * * And martyred two martyrs from your men, for if there are no two men and two of those who are satisfied with the testimony, they will be misleading, so they will be lost.He was kind to “wrote it” and it is otherwise, and it is not for him, if he was a biar, he would not have been able to pass by Waww, so the one who is taught to the two of them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.Writing is the form of the form of disability and its storms, and it reminds that the fear of the forgetfulness, and for the sake of that the name of jurisprudence is the remembrance of the truth, and the name is called.Al -Harith ibn Halaza said: ؎ The warning of the paradise and the staining, and what is the judgment of what is in the rituals of the whims.He makes between the writers of the writer and between the rak'ah, and it is the testimony without a book, because his saying: and you did not find a writer [Al -Baqarah: 283] This is permissible for the writer to be one of the two witnesses.“And testify,” in the sense of testifying, for the Sun and the time are in it for the confirmation of the affirmation, and you are to make them to ask, that is, to ask for the testimony of two witnesses With the pursuit of stress, which is the seductive attachment to the owner of the right, and it is his saying, and the martyrs do not refuse if they are called for the one who is asking for the one who is required They should not be able.(P-106) The testimony is the right to be present and the viewer and what is meant by it is a special presence, and it is a presence for the sake of seeing the end of the time For a witness of a contract between two parties or to hear a contract from one contract, such as divorce and love, and the testimony is also released on the news of the news of the news Any thing that brings the intention of the ruggedness of it for those who claim it, and the ruggedness of it on those who deny it, and this is what is mentioned in his saying: then they did not come with a shower.[4] He made the commanding of him asking for martyrdom because it is the one who is the cost of the cost, and the poisonous understood that the excess of the request of martyrdom is his crop, and this is the matter of the one - and this is the matter of the matter - After that, in compliance, he said: The testimony does not refuse if they are called.And the matter is in his saying: and martyred two martyrs from your men.The saying of the late jurisprudence: Malik, my father Hanifa, Al -Shafi’i, and Ahmad, and he will come when he said: “And testify if you seek.And he said from your men, that is, from the men of the Muslims, and he obtained a partner with him: that they are men, and that they are among the guerrillas.And the congregation of the group of those who address it is intended by Muslims for his saying in the selection of these rulings, O you who believed.As for the boy, he did not consider the law for the weakness of his mind from being surrounded by the case of martyrdom and the entrance to the accusation.And the man is in the origin of the language, it benefits the description of the male, so the female came out, and the idiopath is alienated, so the boys came out.Its ruling after this, and the infidel, because the disturbance of religion must be met in the conditions, pensing and etiquette, so it is not possible to be informed in the conditions of the enemies and the two of the two, the one who is the same It was involved in the Zakat of the Muslims, the intensity of mixing, and because it has been known from the majority of the people of the boredom, the drought of the person who violates the debt with the rights of its disagreement.Rights and ignorance of the obligations of the Islamic religion, because the righteous, the righteous, the righteousness of the defendants did not expose the rights of those who disagree They said: We are not in the illiterate a path [Al -Imran: 75], and this is the provisions of the delegation in many places that are forbidden to be forbidden, or they are commanded by the things, The violation of that is justified with the strange, and we did not see in a debt of the erasure of the settlement in the rights except the religion of Islam.The Muslims are the ones who are divided from the religion of the truth, and they will be destroyed by them, and they are their forefathers, so whoever is without him, so what is necessary from these things to say the truth to them, or for them A follower of the rulings of the supply, that the people of the people are afraid of the people, as it was like this Islam with his Muslim command, with justice with the people of the dhimm He commanded them to do it.In the Qur’an, there is no gesture to this reason that they said that we are not in the illiterate and in Bukhari, in the hadith of Abi Qalba in the Majlis of Omar ibn Umar.Sahl ibn Abi Hathama Al -Ansari, that a repulsion from his people went to Khaybar and they separated it, so they found one of them as a dead man, so they said to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: You killed our friend, they said: We did not kill us.Fifths are in the past.The supporters said in the Jews, they are what They can kill all the people and then they will Payment of the preacher, and the project has acquired it from the preacher of the preacher from its origin.The commandment is in the travel, and they differed in the testimony of the commandment in the travel, so Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Musa al -Ash'ari, and Sharih, said the acceptance of the testimony of the martyrs of the The travel, and Abu Musa al -Ash'ari spent the time of his judgment in the kofa, which is the saying of Ahmad, the Suffinan of the Thuri, and a group of scholars, and the jam said: And they saw that what is in the verse of the commandment is woven, and it is the saying of Zayd ibn Aslam, Malik, and Abu Hanifa and Al -Shafi’i, and they were different in the testimony of some of them.The Muslims, and Abu Hanifah, was permitted by the view of that (P-108), to the abandonment of the concern of their ease with the rights of the Muslims, and the violator of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The Muslims know the safety of some of them with some of their news, as we presented it as a nose.Al -Batti, Ahmad, Isaac, and Abi Thawar, and on the authority of Mujahid Al -Maradar, which is the saying of Malik and my father Hanifa and Al -Shafi’i, who appears to me that you specialize from the slave of the slave And with the measurement; O Lord of the house, my life is not a javer They do not have the same as the conditions of the transgressions, and because they are raising the intensity of care, so they left the testimony of the slave of the servant, A numerous for this reason.The witness with the argument of the student who is the student who is a righteous right, so he can carry it on the warning of the testimony, so he will be buried, so he will be lost, so he will be lost.It is enough for it, and it is dismissed, and the equivalent is that it is removed from the religion and the tranquility, and the second will be increased to it, so that it can be rejoiced.The pluralism is a condition in the testimony where it is, with the difference of the narration, because the accusation is fulfilled in it, as it does not relate to a certain right, and for this, if it is a narration of the narration of the narration of the hadith, it is a matter It has a right to what it was accepted His narration, and he wrapped the age of Aba Moses Al -Ash'ari to come with a witness with him that the Messenger of God said: “If one of you is three, then he is not for him, then he is not for him.” The claim of Abu Moses that when he did not give permission to Omar in the third, he returned, and Abu Saeed Al -Khudari witnessed him in the fullness of the supporters.The number is two in financial transfers as it is here.And his saying: If there were no two men, that is, the witnesses were not a man, that is, where the treatment did not attend the man, but a man, one of the men, " They are witnessing, and a man and two of the two days (P-109) is the condition of the condition, which is the part of a sentence that is deleted, because the estimated is attributed to the expert His saying: And martyrdom, and the deleted understanding, so what you appreciated, Sagh for you.It came in the verse (it was) the deficiency with the ability to be said: if it is not a man.Like it is not deluded from it that the martyrs of the two women are not accepted only when the two men are excused as the people of the people are deluded, and it is the disagreement of the saying of the generosity; Because the stigmatization is the expansion of the two dealers, in which there is another dignity, which is their supplies to the insertion of women in the affairs of life, when it was in the ignorance, not in the ignorance of this The affairs, so God made the two women the status of the one man, and that is with his saying: that one of them is misleading, then the last of them is mentioned, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the last one The fear of the suspicion and the forgetfulness, because the woman is more pardoned than the man with the origin of the jellyfish according to the majority of the majority, and the delusion is here in the sense of the forgetfulness.And his saying: that the reader reads it with the conquest of a gossip, "that" it is deleted from it to the imam of the misery, as it is the majority in the Arabic words with the words of " He knows what he needs in order to release the purpose of persuading the costs, as we do not find in this sentence a ruling that may not be reassured except for the ritual The one with two women, two, and he was explained by his illusion, and the one who is estimated before "is attached to the deleted news in the sentence of the answer.As the estimation: a man and two women witness, or: let a man and two days bear witness, and they read it with a stabil The gambling of advertisement, “is a conditional and“ the action of the condition, and by raising ”, remembers“ that it is a beginner that is deleted after the fulfillment; Because the fulfillment is permissible that what is after it is not permissible and the estimation is the other, it reminds the other on the part of the saying of the Almighty: and whoever returns from it, and the one who will do it.[95] And when it was "misled" in the sense of the misguidance of them.The cause has become a delusion, and not, but the cause is what the misguidance arises from the waste of the witnesses, so he separated from it, so he said: Because (it is mentioned) is a kind On the “misguidance” of the fulfillment of the punishment, then it is from its complement, and the lesson is the last words as we presented it in its saying, the Almighty: What is the one who will be from it.266] And his counterpart, as in the scouts, say: I domesticated the wood to tend to the one who tends, and I support him, and I have prepared the weapon to come as an enemy, so I will pay it, and I will pay it.On the authority of Al -Zahir, which is to say: to remember one of them when it is forgotten.And the owner (P-110) directed him to the scout that there is no significance in the right to be reckoning until the speaker became the most important of his causes, and he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.And the son of Al -Hajib claimed in his hopes of this verse with a year of six times and a reassurance: that from the language of the Arabs if they mentioned a cause - and it is for the sake Remember the cause of the cause and made the cause to be given to it with the fulfillment of the two connotations with a single dilem That is a risk and I did not see it for others.And that I see that the enemy is like that in the same way, that the cause is a way to be a mediator as your saying: I did like this as a generosity for you, and a crime that will be a crown We benefit from his payment, for you will come to the one who speaks to him with what is indicated by the two things in the image The number of people's fear of the person of the single woman, so that, with her saying, the right of the witnessed to him and the intention of reminding the woman is the second one, and this is the goodness What the owner of the scout mentioned.And in his saying: So you remember the last one in the place of giving, because the appearance is required to say: So it is mentioned the last, and that is the one who is not the one and the last The person of the intended is appointed to them, so how did you put them in the subjects of the actor and the active, the meaning was one, and if he had a sacrifice for the sake of the one It was his saying (one of them) - the appearance - an actor or a verb with it, so it is not thought that it was not the same (one of them) the appearance in the verse is an actor that contradicts the aspect of the Because if I was guaranteed, the annexed was an act, and the verb is not the subject, as it was thought of the Tafizani, because the perspective is in it in the adoption of the appearance in the end of the With the union of the meaning, and it is supplied in the verse as it is not hidden.Then the joke of the emergence here, in which the ideas of the interpreters were not borne in it, and the advanced were exposed to it.The confrontation of “one of them” is not hidden, and it is not hidden that it is not from the place of the appearance, the position of the host, as the remembrance is not the one who is the one who is the one who is made ( The location of the verb, and it is not permissible to be able The active in the place of the dress, and it is correct to say: then it is mentioned the last, so the enemy must be of a disorder, and the Issam said in the footnote to the goodness: The origin of the installation: to remember the last of them (P-111) if it is lost, then when it was presented (if it is lost) and was released in the presentation of the cause, the guarantee was not valid, that is, the guarantee, that is, the guarantee, that is.And it did not correct: to mislead the last.Because it is not improved before the remembrance (one of them), that is, because (the other) is only a description in an interview and a reference to a reminder, so he changed (any of them) (The last) was noted by (one of them) and he was not changed the origin of the cause of his body; Because he was not presented to him, they were misleading, meaning this is the face of the emergence.Al -Khafaji said in the footnote to interpretation: They said: The dignity is the dignity; Because every one of the two women is permissible for what is permissible for her owner from misguidance and remembrance, so the words entered the meaning of the general, meaning that it is not the same The two women only be the remembrance of the other, so you will not be a witness to the argument, and the origin of this answer to the measuring of the debt of the conqueror is the one who is the one who is a question.The question: The head of the people of the world, the righteousness ∗∗∗ and whoever denounces it on all the irrigation, spread it ؎ what is pleased to be the last of one without its remembrance of it in a verse of the goodness The briefing of the destiny is on the authority of one of them, even if he mentioned it ؎ ؎ His jewelry ∗∗∗ from the sea of ​​your knowledge, then he sent his buttocks, and he answered the Ghaznawi: “Whoever praises him with knowledge, and whoever is in the authority of his life Only, the saying is a subject ∗∗∗ both of them, so it is for the purification of its abstaining, and if it came with a guarantee that was required ∗∗∗ one of the two years of his ruling So, as you ∗∗∗ you are not satisfactory to those who have been blessed with this, who has forgiven the whole of them with it ∗∗∗ God knows in Al -Fahwah what he mentioned and the answer to the question and the answer to the question and the answer to the question and the answer to the answer The strange division in its interpretation, as he made (one of them), the first, intended for one of the two martyrs, and made (misleading) in the sense of the one who wrapped in the one, and the one who is wrapped in (P-11) It is intended for one of the two women, and when the significance did not remain, there was no vision in the place of the guarantee, and it is a cost and a dispersal of the guarantee, there is no indication of it It is upon him, which is the one who was intended to say it: and whoever you repeat the solution...Etc.And that I see that this emergency in the place of guests is the intention of receiving the sentence in its sins, as it does not need other words in which the restriction of the oppression, The sentence is to run The parable of the example, and as if what is meant is the gesture that both sentences are the cause of the Shariah, the number of women is in the testimony, so the woman is an exposure to the way What does it intend to connect, and multiple is a preacher to disturb the materials of the deficiency and the deficiency, so it is not that you do not forget one of what the last forgot about, so he said: The confessing of the one, and its saying: So you remember the last one to give a second woman until the first testimony of its origin does not invalidate.* * * The testimony does not refuse if they are called.He was kind to “do not refuse” and martyred two martyrs, because when he commanded those who are disabled by the martyrdom of witnesses, he ended those who are required to testify that he will be martyred.Rather, it came in the rhetoric of those who are disabled with the form of the matter and the coming of the rhetoric of the testimony in the form of the final formula, as it is in the way that is in it And the witnesses think that the abstinence is that they are art, and every one is obligated against it.And the name of the claimants is a testimony of the first condemnation, which is the drying, and as if there is a great joke in that, which is the gesture that they are in the jurisprudence of the ritual of the ritual They have the answer, and they became a testimony.And the work of “called” was omitted either to his appearance from his saying - before him - and martyred two martyrs, that is, if they are called for testimony, that is, the lowering, and this is the saying Solomon, and it was transferred from Ibn Abbas, so it is forbidden for the prayer when the supplication to the testimony is the first, and it is permissible for it to be (p-113) the delegate of the work, that is, the meaning of the work They were invited to load and perform with.Al -Hasan said it, and Ibn Abbas said Mujahid: If they are called for performance in particular, and perhaps he who carried it on that is his saying, “Al -Shahda” because they are not the same The lowering and its exclusion is that God Almighty said after this: And do not conceal the testimony [Al -Baqarah: 283], and that is forbidden from the abuse when the supplication is for the performance.And that appears that the consequences of the act of “called” for the use of the inclusion of what they call for the sake of it in the disability: whoever is borne by the intention of the martyr The need for the evidence, Ibn Al -Hajib said: And the lowering where it is agreed upon, and the pleasure of sufficiency and the performance from the part of the people - if they are two - are the abuse of my eyes The Yemeni.And the saying in the requirement of the forbidden here is like a saying in his saying: A writer does not refuse and appears that the beating is appointed by the awareness of the imam, or with what is insisted The imposition of an eye except for a freedom, and the last of the sufficiency is transferred.The imposition of a sufficiency unless it is assigned to it that it is not found.It is obligatory On the condition of the judge’s elevation and the proximity of the place to return the witness to his house on his day, and his knowledge that he accepts his martyrs and demands the claimant.And in this commentary, in response to testimony to the cost of the testimonies of witnesses, and that is a section of interpretations that do not want to open it.Al -Qarbi said: It is taken from this verse that it is permissible for the imam to reside for people with witnesses, and make them sufficient for them from the house The peoples of the people are kept for it, I said: The judges of the predecessors of the advanced and its princes have improved, in the awareness of the witnesses of the arguments of the testimony of the test The judges accept them and know them with the fullness, and the matter was in the Andles, and that is from the good view of the nation, and that was not followed by the country of the They are satisfied with the month of the elevation of some jurisprudence and their connection to the conditions and the books of the charity, so the judges are entrusted with them, and they will be entrusted to them from the one who is in And the rulings, and it was what was considered in the translation of some scholars to say: It was an acceptance when the judge was so.(P-114) (And do not give it a young or older to write it) The small transactions are more than the oldest, so they are forbidden from the day here, and the imam: the fullness of the repetition of action.The speech is for the two wealthy, and that is followed by the writer's speech; Because if the two are involved, if he invites him to the book, he must write.And it is forbidden for it to be forbidden, and it is left the writer because the woman is obtaining the same from other than choosing, so it is not forbidden for it in itself, and it was said that the day is from the right And he (young or old) was erected in the case of the stipulated guerrilla (you write it) or on (it was) with its name.And the old man is presented to the oldest here, with the necessity of the opposite, as the oldest of the Sunnah on the sleep in its saying, the Almighty: Do not take it.He intended here to eavesdrop on the general to pay what he dills from the delusions in the few who take care of the young, and it is more, or the intention of the numbers of the book I am confined to the young.And the sentence (to its sake) is a state of the stipulated in the (written it), that is, the eater of the debt, to the sake of it, which is disabled, and the intended to be seduced in the book.* * * That is the most important of God and the most lowering of the martyr Interest, that is, just, because it is kept for the truth and the people of the testimony, that is, the delegate to its residence, and the closest to the negation of the rapid and the suspicion, so this is three of it.The legal intention is that the testimony will be clearly clear, far from the norms and delusions, and the name of the sign is based on all of the people who do not Male, so I refer to it in the name of the one.(P-115) In the verse, there is an argument for the assumption of the law of the law with a multiple rate, and this does not want the difference in it.And I miss the most descendant of: the most important, in the sense of: justice, and it is a horse, and it is not: Because it is in the sense of a neighbor, and so I derive “more” from the testimony of the testimony: if he appears.A neighbor on the saying of Sibuyeh, with the formula of the formula of impact and admiration for the tranquilizer, whether the ham of the enemy was the one who is given, Excessive, and the owner of the scouts was the “strongest” that is derived from a cruelty in the sense of a pretext, that is, the form of proportions, and it is a problem; As this adultery does not have a verb, and it is also formed by the fact that its formulation is more severe than its formulas than its formulation than the quadruple, and the answer is that the lineage is here.As the source is the origin of the detence, and that it is (folds) derived from: he rose, who is transformed into the weight of the verb - by adding the eye - the indication of the prostration of the one who comes from it ( Similar.* * * Except that there is a present merchant that you will turn between you, so there is no ward to you that you will not write it as a matter It was said: It is interrupted, because the present merchants are not from the debt in anything, and the estimation: except that the present merchant.And the present: the successful, which is not delayed in it, as the present, the urgent and the successful, is an overflow, the religion, the deadlines, and the human being are exhausted.And his saying: You turn it on between you, for a sentence to be a merchant present, but the Bayan in the same way is this one is close to it in the saying of the poet, from what he sought from the son of Al-Aini said: It is attributed to the Farzdaq: ؎ To God, I complain about the city of need, and the last thing is how they met (P-116), when he made the owner of the scout.And the last) or make it “manages it” a second characteristic of (a merchant) in the sense of the Bayan, and perhaps its remembrance of its remembrance: the gesture to the thoroughness of the privilege in leaving the book, because it is the one who has the abandonment of the book.On the authority of the book, and it was said: The discretion is communicated, and it is intended by the present merchants: the postponed to a relative term, then it is from the sentence of the debt.And his saying: It is not for you to have a widow that you do not write it with the understanding of the discretion, with what is in the increase of its saying (a wing) from the indication that this is the referee, until the referee is that this The wing raised the authorization that the writing is first and better.And the audience read a “merchant” by raising: that “it is complete”, and it was read by Sama “It is a steadfast guarantee that is useful for what is reported by the news, that is, the merchants are present, as in the saying of Amr ibn Shas - his siblings - A lion, do you know about our calamities ∗∗∗ If it is a day with the heels of its fate: if the day is a day with a cup.And he said: “Except“ his origin, if not, he draws a tunnel.* * * And testify if you are creative for a custody of the sale, even if without a debt, if the sale is not a present, and this is a dealer, and this is a matter I wish it to him like a sales of religion, either a success in a merchant or a successful person in other than a merchant such as the real estate and the shows other than the merchants, and it was said: “What is meant by” Summary in leaving the writing with the meeting of testimony with a book, and this is very far, because the writing was only for the sake of martyrdom and trust.And the Almighty said: “And testify”: It was said to the duty, and this is the saying of Abu Moses Al -Ash'ari, Ibn Omar, Abu Saeed Al -Khudari, Said Bin Bin, (p-117) Ataa, Ibn Jarraj, Al-Nakhi, and Jabir Bin Zaid, Dawood Al-Zahiri, and Al-Tabiri, and the prophet was witnessed ﷺ on the sake of the servant of the son He wrote and wrote in that: “In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.The Muslim is sold to the Muslim, ”and it was said: He is the delegate and gone to him from the good and the people, and it is the saying of Malik, and my father, and the father, With the Sunnah: “The Prophet ﷺ sold and did not testify.” Ibn al -Arabi said, and his answer: That is in the positions of the dead and the saying of the Almighty will come to you: The son of the son of Attiyah was presented in his husbands, the number of the garment, and we returned to him when he said: “So write it”.* * * There is no writer or martyr, and if you do, it is a market for you.It is forbidden for the muddy, and it bears the writer and the martyr is a source of harm, or that the author be written for him and the witnessed to him is a source of light, for the sake of the light, for the sake of the light, Building for the knowledgeable and for the ignorance, and for the choice of this material here is what is meant, for its rulers, so that the words will be directed to it It is incompatible, and this is from the face of miracle.And the harms: the entry of the war that the two witnesses are signed by the two witnesses and the writers in the embarrassment and the loss, or what is being done to the testimony, and we have taken our jurisprudence from the righteousness of the verse It is separated from the damage, including the ride of the witness from the distance, which is distant, and from it, it is left to the exposure of it after the long period of time, which is the thought of the one, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who thinks it.It is an expression that he signs in the obligatory For the governors of the affairs, make a side of the money of the money of the money to pay the expenses of the testimonies and their residence in their country, and the murder of what will be attained from that Lost their families, insulting the establishment of justice with the amount of energy and capacity.“ And the great murmur said: The misery of the name is the immorality after faith.* * * Fear God and teach you God and God with everything knowing.He commanded piety because it is the angel of good, and that it will be left of the debauchery, and its saying: God teaches you to remind you of the grace of Islam, which is the one who has been brought out to the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come out to the sake of the knowledge of the And the system of the world, which is the greatest of science and its benefit, and the promise of this because it is coming in it with the harms, and in its compassion on the matter with piety, the gesture of the righteousness, that the piety is the cause It was said: Wow is in it to explain, that is: to teach you, and make it one of them from the suffering of waw, and it is not correct.And the appearance of the name of the majesty in the three sentences of the intention of the intensity in every sentence of it until the independence of the sign is, without the need, otherwise it is not the same If the smile is heard every one of them, a transmitted science has a transmitted science, and no one may hear, so it does not harm it in the understanding of its last, and the opposite of this is the one who says: The generosity of the righteousness and his father, and the mother is generous from the righteousness and what is affectionate, and the mother is a disease for a righteousness who kill him with him ∗∗∗ They are not killed with a significance that is ever, so it is for the sake And what I was born, the pain appeared in the three sentences, and when the four sentences were like confirmation of the third, the name of the mother did not appear, and this is the name Tawil, and to repeat the places in which it is good, and the arms in which the sheep said in the evidence of miracle, in the conclusion in which it is mentioned that the one who has been tired of you is not the same For its reasons, and that some of the imams may be subjected to the sin in the interpretation: and from that (p-119) what was narrated from the owner that he said: The one was the son of the son of the son Al -Roumi and parking what he chooses.She contemplated her, and she contemplated her, and I found it.She has left the best house that was not pulled on him while he was saying: The sword and the sword are overwhelmed, and I said: Why did you leave this house?He said: Perhaps the pen may be overburdened, and then he saw me after he was excluded with excuse that was evil from his left, so he said: I left it because it is because it is The sword repeated four times, the owner said: If he had not prepared it, the house would be spoiled, Sheikh Abd al -Qahar said: The matter was as the owner said.Then he said: Abu Yaqoub said it: The Kniyah and the exposure do not work in the minds to do disclosure and confusion; For the sake of that, it was for the return of the word in his saying: And the truth was descended and with the truth we descended [Al -Israa: 105] and his saying: Say: God is one of God: It is.Al -Raghbib said: They have been developed in his saying: So what is the nuclei, the nuclei was cut off, the nuclei was cut off until it was said: If he had a camel, he said: Recorder is an improved action that falls on the way of exorbitance, or the compassion, in a rulings, every sentence of it is independent of its soul, and it is the same.Repeating in one or in a sentence in a sense, and in which there is no sense of exaltation and grievance, the desire is an agreement to the one of the sins of Ibn Al -Amaid.For the owner, Bin Abbad, Al -Marzouki said in the evil of Hamas when he said Yahya Bin Ziyad: When I saw the young, he did not blame him.Welcoming the duty to say: I told him a welcoming.But they repeat the flags, the names of many gests, and the intention is to be fool.(P-120) Know that it is not the recession of the conjunction of the glorification, but rather its position, every place from which it is intended to record the verbal affiliation to the owner of the name, as well Peta Hammasa: ؎ The mother is generous from righteousness...Etc.Al -Takrir has been punished in the words of the Almighty in the Surah Al -Amran: And among them is a separation, they will come to their teeth by writing to the book of the book God is what is from God and they say to God the falsehood and they know [Al -Imran: 78].
