The Quranic researcher, the month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed to people and evidence of guidance and difference.The verses of the verses, and its saying: the month of Ramadan is a beginner, deleted, deleted, its estimation is; That is, the enemy days are the month of Ramadan, and the sentence (P-169) is a Biany.Because his saying: days of numbers [Al -Baqarah: 184] The question of the Sama` raises the appointment of these days, and that supports the reader of a journey, “a month” with a month."Days": a detail.The chain of transmission is deleted to him on the way of the recovery in the chain of transmission to it if it is presented from the words in which it is separated and shown to the conditions of the chain of transmission Its guarantee, and if you allow this speech a copy of the priority of the verse, it is not true that the estimation is: it is the month of Ramadan, and it will be aware that it is a month of Ramadan, His saying is his saying: He who has witnessed the month, let him fast, and the news is established by fulfillment at that time, then observance of the beginning of the beginning, And the like is a lot in the Qur’an and in the words of the Arabs, or on the increase in fulfillment in the news as his saying: a good saying, so they marry their deaths, and he shed it, and this is the one.Weak.And the month is a part of the twelve part of the year of the Sunnah.And the month starts from the appearance of the crescent to the attachment, then the crescent appeared again, and it is derived from the month; Because the crescent appears to them, they will show it to the people, so the month will prove to them.And Ramadan: a science and not a quarrel; As a source heard on the weight of the verb from Ramadan - by breaking the Mim - if it was burned; Because the verb indicates the obligation and there is no meaning here, and it was said: It is a quotation from the source.And Ramadan is a science for the ninth month of the Arab Sunnah of the Lunar Sunnis.The Arabs were opened to the most famous of the year; Because the end of the public with them is to spend the pilgrimage and the period of return to their horizons, not to see that a hand made Jumada the second, which is the end of the winter, a sixth month, then he said: Jumi six ∗∗∗ Part, so the hero of its fasting, fasting, and Ramadan are varied from the knowledge of the scientific and the increase of the thousand and the noun; Because it is derived from the speeches, which is the free, because Ramadan is the first to be the most free to be based on what was a human being in the Sunnah when the Arabs were when it was (p-170) to the Sunnah to the Sunnah The chapters of each chapter, including two months: the first chapter is the perceived and its celebrities are forbidden and zero, the second: the first rabbi, which is the time of the ripening of the fruits and the appearance of the wet and the one who is the first And the month of Rabi The second is that the first and the second is a description of a month, not to see that the Arabs say: the wet is a month of a rapist, the third: the winter and its celebrities are the first and the second of the second.A club that does not see the dog from its dark darkness.For the sake - and this is the time to appear the light and the woman, and its celebrities are a righteous and two peoples, and it is the chapter of dirhams and the rain.Raaba warns it ∗∗∗ If the water of the dome is broken and its second heavens; Because he comes after the first Lord in the Sunnah of the Sunnah, the napstel said: ؎ If the father of Qaboos will destroy you ∗∗∗ the rabid of the second and the country of the forbidden in the narration.And they called each of them Because it is a zipper time, the fifth chapter is the fast, and it is the principle of freedom, and its celebrities are symbolic and thoroughly; Because the camel is the ears in which the flies are stripped.Sixth: The liquid and its celebrities are the seat and the argument.And some doves are divided into four, every chapter has three months; It is the rabbi and its famous people, the righteous, the two peoples and the Ramadan, the voter and its months are shawl, the seat, and the argument, and the burgers are forbidden, whistle, yellow And the month of the second month of Rabi'a - the first and the second and a class for a month, not for a salesman - and the first and the second Jumada.And when the famous Arabs were a moon, and the moon was less than the days of the sunnah in which the chapters come, the twenty -one decreases, and the day of the day, and the day of the day.The pilgrimage at the time of the void is from the pants and the ritual and the time of peace from the cold and the severity of the free - they made for the months a clothing with the increase of a month in the year after three years Women.(P-171) The names of all the months are the flags of the first month of the first rabbi and the month of the second Rabi`, so it is necessary to mention the month of them, then it is the same.Because it is the first month of the sake of the Lord, the first is the first, for the first and the second are two classes for a month, and the last famous is permissible in it.The type is to one of it, like the trees of the Arak and the city of Baghdad, and this is the feeling of the words of his Sibuyeh and the investigators, so whoever says: It is not said that the one is said to be Ramadan is a source, until it costs it to prevent it from knowing that it became an addition to a month of knowledge, so he prevented the part of the flag from the way as it was forbidden in the way.It costs a stipulation and a violation of what was narrated from the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “Whoever fasts Ramadan with faith and affiliation” by sharing Ramadan, but he was carried out to them this illusion of the Battle The Diwan is as in the writer's literature.Rather, the month was added to Ramadan in this verse with the fact that the briefly required of them requires the rest of its remembrance, either because it is the most famous in the eloquence of their words, and the words All of his days in the fast; Because if he said: Ramadan, it was a phenomenon, not a text, but with his saying: (days), then the Samaghs will understand that they are days of Ramadan.The meaning is that the part of the Arab Sunnah is the one who was made a cure for the performance of the fasting of fasting in the debt, so the one who has been in religion, then The Sunnah called the month of Ramadan, and the Muslims had to perform the fast of fasting in it, and when his solutions were deceived every year, he was a good one.Fasting was not involved in one month, and because what was done on the month of the characteristics is achieved that what is meant by the semester is the length of the day.And the appearance of his saying: in which the Qur’an is revealed that the addressees know that the Qur’an is descended from the month of Ramadan, because the majority in the prayer of the prayer A scholar of his choice of those who have been running on the connector, and because the same is the religious event from his matter, not to be hidden from them, so the words will be reminded of this It is also permissible to be a flag of this virtue, and the words are made on the way of description with the connection to his alarm on the fact that the Sufis is the one who is the same Where it makes a way for his knowledge, and we do not hand over the necessity of the knowledge of the addressee with the justice of the prayer with its guarantee in the definition of the one who is the same He testifies to it, followed by their words, and the intended (P-172) is about the month of Ramadan that it was revealed in the Qur’an; Because the installation of the words does not allow its admission to the news; Because the month of Ramadan has been memorized, and it is not a beginner, and it is intended to remove the Qur’an, the start of its removal on the Prophet ﷺ, for it is in it the beginning of the descent from one year He expressed his first landing in the name of all; Because that is the estimated destiny that is entitled to it, as it came in a lot of verses, like his saying: This is a book that we descended from [92] Treat his descent, and all that he is attached to after after, and his saying may be presented: and those who believe in what was revealed to you [Al -Baqarah: 4] It was revealed in the same; Because the month in which the Qur’an was revealed before we have passed away from the verse of fasting by several years, because the fasting of Ramadan is imposed in the Sunnah of the Sunnah The imposition of fasting and the month in which the Qur’an was revealed - a number of two years, and he is appointed by the villages that what is meant is like it; That is: in his counterpart from a year last.God has made the limitations of the one who is a single thing that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: And remind them of the days of God [Ibrahim: 5], so God made it up to the times that he has compared something great in the best of the virtue that he made the time of the virtues of the virtue of the righteousness of it.For a great matter, and perhaps this is the one who made God for the sake of the gift of guidance in Hajj; Because in the same way, in that time, God will be brought up by the sacrifice of his son The news of the Prophet ﷺ, and it comes from this as the offspring of the Messenger of God and the Sons of the righteous, and the greatest and majestic of the laws of the laws who are based The princes, judges and imams.This indicates that the meant of God is the highest of the nation, the fast of the three days, followed by the beginning and the end of the beginning.And when that was the intention, you were met with a lunar, inspired by the essence of his beginning and its end with the vision of the crescent and the estimation, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Because it was honored by the Qur’an in it, then the Qur’an is revealed when the intention of the nation’s eagerness was and guided it, so it is that it is what is in it.The kingdom is located in it, and the dilemma is thinking that the Prophet ﷺ was fasting days that he was rushed in the cave of Hara, before he was revealed to him, and for the sake of God, and God bless us.(P-173) of the Hanafi Mourning, when the revelation was revealed to him in the month of Ramadan, the command of the Islamic nation is in the fasting in that month, that the month of the month of the month of that is the one who said: “I gave the sacrifice of the month of Ramadan,” Ibn Saad said: The revelation came while he was in the cave of the day of the day of the seven of the seven of the seven of Ramadan.And his saying: a guidance for people and evidence from the guidance of the Qur’an from the Qur’an, reference to them to the face of the preference of the month because of what the guidance and the differences came in.What is meant by the first guidance: What is in the Qur’an from the guidance to the public and private reconciliation that does not contradict the public, and with the evidence from the guidance: what is in the Qur’an from the cursing of the hidden guidance A lot of people, such as evidence of the neutrality, the honesty of the Messenger, and other than that of Quranic arguments.And the differences are a separation, and it has been spread in the difference between the right and the falsehood; That is, the declaration of separation between the right that came from God and between the falsehood that they were before Islam, so what is meant by the first guidance: a guidance from the guidance of the one who is the one who is the guidance of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one repetition.* * * He who has witnessed the month of you, let him fast and whoever is sick or on a traveler, a number of last days A separation on his saying: the month of Ramadan in which the Qur’an is revealed, which is a bayun for his saying: He wrote to you fasting [Al -Baqarah: 183] as you are, as it is.The clarification after the chapter on what he followed, his saying: He wrote to you fasting [Al -Baqarah: 183] from Steinas and intending it with the best of fasting and what is necessary from the one With piety, and God has neglected him, and he was imposed on the nation from a facilitation when the crops of fasting from fasting.And Zaida “from you” is a follower of those who believed in the same as the bridle before him; That is: Everyone who attends the month, let him fast, and (witnessed) may be in the sense of attendance as it is said: So that so, he witnessed a dice and witnessed one of the witnesses or witnessed All with the Messenger of God ﷺ; That is, he attended it, so the month set up that it is an effective in it because of the act of a witness; That is: attended in the month; That is, he was not a traveling traveler, and it is the appropriateness for his saying after him: and whoever is sick or on a travel etc.(P-174) That is: Whoever attends in the month, he will fast all of him, and it is understood that those who attend some of him fast the days of his presence.It is permissible for him to be a witness in the sense of his knowledge of the Almighty: God witnessed that there is no god but he is [Al -Imran: 18], so the month of the month will be on the authority of the month.That is, he knew about the solutions of the month, and it is not a witness in the sense of an opinion; Because it is not said: He witnessed in the sense of opinion, but a witness is said, and the month is not here in the sense of its crescent, based on that the month is called the crescent, as it is narrated, as it is.The tumor: ؎ So, the most clear of the part is what the month sees the month before the people, and it is a slim, that is: the core of the month sees; Because the crescent is not valid for him to do the action of “witnessed” in the sense of attendance, and whoever understands the verse on that, he has made a mistake that he has made a mistake, and he is a mistake, and he is a mistake, and he is the one who has been made Husla and whose fast is on his scenes, the crescent of Ramadan, so whoever does not see the crescent is not obligatory for him to fast, and this is false, and this is not in the verse, and it is not possible.Rather, the Sunnah has shown it with the hadith of “Do not fast until you see the crescent and do not break the fast until you see it, so if you are overwhelmed, then you can be able to do it.” From the interpretation of the verse.And the generosity read: (the Qur’an) with a deadly gossip after the poor view and after the hamor The hammer to the dwelling view of the intended dimension.And his saying: Whoever is sick or on a traveler, they said in the face of his return with the progress of his counterpart in his saying: Whoever was sick from you: Al -Baqarah: 184] And obligatory to choose between him and between the accent by feeding the first verse, and it is written on you fasting [Al -Baqarah: 183], etc.We copied the wisdom of that The verse is by saying: the month of Ramadan, and the fasting became a duty of fear that people think that all were in the first verse of the rituals, so the ritual is the right of the sake Also, until the sick and the traveler, so this is restored in this version of the copyright, as a successful meeting of that license, and the abundance of the etc.And health is not other than, and it is a construction on the time of the verse of the verse before it, for if we were pleased that they were descended at one time, the direction was to return this.Al -Jadir with his saying: And whoever is satisfied because he came after the help of the days of fasting, and as for what was presented in the first verse, it is a miracle of the flags, with the flags, That his return to pay the understanding that the first is woven with his saying: He who has witnessed from you the month, let him fast it if he (P-175) “witnessed“ The confirmation of the ruling of the privilege and the increase in the meaning of his saying: Whoever has witnessed the month of you, let him fast.* * * God wants you to the secret, and he does not want the hardship to you.That is, the judiciary has started; Because he wants you to the secret at the hardship.And his saying: He does not want the hardship for you a negation of against the secret, and he was taking place in these two sentences, the sentence of palaces; We have to say: What he wants only to the secret, but it is amended from the sentence of palaces to the two sentences of evidence and negation; Because the intended is a verb, it is the prestige of the rituals to be an illusion of the privatization, and then the sentence of the negation came to confirm it, and it is permissible for it to be.With you, the secret, and the hardship will not want you to be angry for all of what you say from his saying: He wrote to you fasting [Al -Baqarah: 183] to here, and there is a gesture that is a gesture that is a generosity that is The image of hardship and the hardship is waving, so it is in the interest of the interest that indicates that God wanted it to the secret, that is: it is easy to get the ritual of the soul of the soul Some other religions themselves.The jams read: the secret and the hardship of the cinema in them, and Abu Jaafar read it to the guarantor of the cinema.* * * And to complete the enemy, and to grow up to God for what guided you, and you may thank you for a sentence that God wants you to be pleased, etc.; As it is in the satellite of the heart as you knew; For the group of this is the fourth sentence, it is an exhaustion of what he said from his saying: Whoever has witnessed the month of you to his saying: a number of days: (Let them grow) is called almost likely, and it is the lam that the fell more after the reaction and the verb of the matter; That is: a matter of matter; Those who are effective that the source is with its action, so that (P-176) has the right to be transgressing to it The action of the will and the action of the matter of the matter with itself without the letters of the run, but there is a lot in the words, its enemy with the end of the mother, the words God, with their mouths [Al -Saff: 8] He said in the scout: As originally, they want to be guided, and from it the saying of the Almighty: I was commanded that I am the first of the Muslim: 12] The lam is erected that it appears or is estimated.The meaning: God wants to complete the enemy, and to grow up to God, and entrust the enemies, to make the days of the days that he breaks, whoever is upon him, may God bless him.Full Ramadan, for that time is a judgment that provides the preservation of it, so the judiciary has obtained the rule of legislation and with the breakfast of the breakfast to the owner of the owner Lighting.And the generosity read: (And they completed) with the cessation of the kaf and the mim might be reduced, and Abu Bakr read it, on the authority of Asim and Jacob, with the conquest of the Kaf, And his saying: And to grow up to God on what guides you, kindness on his saying: And to complete the number, and this is included in the meaning of the But it is included in the intention of the will of God Almighty, and it is to enlarge it.And the pride is an effective that is intended by the proportions and the description; That is, to attribute God to the oldest, and the lineage is here a lineage with the linguistic saying, and the greater here is a largest meaning, not a body, so it is the bone, the glorification, the glorification, the majesty, the majesty, the majesty, the glorification, the majestic, All of them; That is, to describe God with greatness, and that is that you say: God is greater, so the interaction here is taken from the verb of the one who says: Pasta and Hamdal and Halle, and she was presented with the words on the name; That is, to say: God is greater, and it is a sentence that indicates that God is greater than every great in the occurrence, such as the rulings, the murdered, the masters and the leaders, and from all the greatness in the abuse And the greatest attributes of God in the word (God is greater) as a structure of his body with divine; Because the impact is required to be a deficiency of those whom he promised and the deficiency is not due to divinity; Because her truth does not meet anything of the shortage, and that is the one who is a junction in prayer to abuse what they were close to them to their idols, and so on The end of fasting with this verse, for the sake of that is the Sunnah of the Sunnah that the Muslims grow up with al -Kharj to the prayer of Eid, and the imam is enlarged in (P-177) And in the memorization of the pride when the fasting is a generous special, which is that the participants were clinging to their gods with the food, and the eating of the time, To say the Muslim: God is greater, indicating that God is worshiped by fasting and that he is bound by the guarantee of idols.And his saying: (Perhaps you will be thankful) And to grow up to God for what this guides you, for the greatest greatness is a grateful and thank you.Because it is the sayings in which there is a greatness for God Almighty, and it will be the act of proximity from the charity in the days of fasting and the days of the verse, and from the pride of the The day of the fungus.The verse has indicated the matter with greatness; As it made it what God wants, and it is not separated in the memorization of the ancients, and is beautiful in the time of the arrogance and its number, and the Sunnah of the Sunnah has indicated that On the choice between jurisprudence in the case.As for the pronouncement of the arrogance, it is the most visible of the verse that every saying in which God is greater, and the most famous in the Sunnah is that God repeats the greatest of three Hanifah and Al -Shafi’i, and Malik and Al -Shafi’i said: If the woman wants, he increases the greatest and tied to Two passed, then he said: There is no god but God, and God is greater, God is greater, and for God, praise, and He is the saying of Ibn Omar and Ibn Abbas, and Ahmad said: Grands.As for his time: the proud of the verse starts from the time of the prayer of the prayer, from his house to the place of prayer, and the imam and whoever comes out with him, then if he reached the prayer of the prayer The arrogance, and it is good at the beginning of every rak'ah from the rak'ahs of the Eid prayer The city is one of the covenant of the Prophet ﷺ, so what is after it and the mourning of the mourners of the voices, and there is a lot of disagreement, and there is no extensive in the development of its remembrance and the command of the matter The sermon of the prayer of Eid after the prayer and the arrogance with it is enlarged with it when it is enlarged and listened to the speech while the arrogance.Ibn Abbas and Said bin Al -Masib and the son of Ibn Al -Zubayr and Al -Shafi’i said: People grow up from the time of the Hilal Al -Fitr until the sake of the prayer of the Eid This is all in the fungus, as it is the source of the verse that we are alone in its interpretation.“ His separation comes in the interpretation of His Excellency: and remember God in numerous days [Al -Baqarah: 203].
