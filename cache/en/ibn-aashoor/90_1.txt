The researcher of the Qur’an was divided into this country and you are in this country and a child and what was born of our creation in a life Ziada in diving.And (I do not divide): (I swear).This was provided that it was not time, including what is in the surah of the right.The saying was presented in: Is the navigator more or is used in its meaning as a result of the greatest matter of the matter of its division.Referring to (this) with his leadership in the country, referring to a present in the wretchedness of the Samaen as if they were seeing it; Because his vision is developed for them, which is the country of Mecca, and the same is what is in his saying: (I was commanded to worship the Lord of this country [ant: 91]).And the extension of the two references is the characteristic of the division of it, the most important characteristic of the intensity of its intention.And the country: a side of a wide from the ground that was - as it is a wonderful - a gambling like the saying of Raabah ibn al -Ajej: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ A side of the earth is made in which there are homes from a building, which is a country of Mecca (P-347) and the section in the country with it that it does not indicate a characteristic of the characteristics of the divine self-timer It is a manner from the greatness of God, the Most High and His Excellency.And a sentence (and you are a solution with this country) is an expulsion between the sympathetic sympathy divided by it, and the waw is symptom.What is meant by the symptoms is different from the contradiction of the meaning of the meaning (and you are a solution), so it is permissible for (a solution) to be the name of a source (a solution), that is, the meaning of the meaning: This is a permissible country that prohibits the harm of his fold and the support of his tree, and they are with that, they will kill you and your deeds, he said this is the sacrifice The synonyms of the arrogance of the sentence of the sentence, and on it, the news is about the same Messenger ﷺ with (a solution) in which an added is appreciated by what is in the way of what is good for you From the right of this country from the sanctity and security, and the meaning that is broken by the participants in their aggression and their injustice of the Messenger ﷺ in a country that they do not oppress.And the appropriateness starts the division with the king of which is a notice of its prohibition.He came to them with a peace of God.It is permissible to be (a solution) a name that is derived from the solution and it is against the prohibition, that is: who does not follow it as it does.Mujahid and Al -Saddi said: That is, what you have made in something, then you are in a solution, or you are in a solution from those who kill you to fight him.And close to him on the authority of Ibn Abbas: that is, what you have been able to do so.He will be believed in the case and the future.And he said in the scouts: It means: You are a solution to it in the future, and we will be in the future.With dignity and love, you are The honorable love.These symptoms are a question for the Messenger ﷺ presented to him before the remembrance of the symptoms of the partners from Islam, and he promised that he will be able to.And on both of the two lines in the adjective (a solution) is his privilege for the Prophet ﷺ and the prophet had allocated it to the day of the conquest and said: (P-348) Hadith.And in Al -Muwala, Malik said: The Messenger of God ﷺ was not a day, that is, the day of the conquest is forbidden.Without a warrant for the pilgrimage or the life.Fawakh and pension, these are permissible, and they are not forbidden; Malik is that it is necessary to be forbidden, and it is narrated from it, and the correctness is its duty, so if you leave it, al -Baji said: So the purified of the time is that there is nothing, and it is not a matter The gold is among those who were among the people of the meeqaat or from the outside.Mecca without a warning if he does not want to be a pilgrimage from Hajj or Umrah, but whoever is one of the people of the outstanding of the time The funeral of the income is to the income.The giving of some of the first people: that you are a solution to this country) that it is a state, meaning: I will be in this country.Al -Qarbi and Al -Baydawi are like that, and it requires that there be a sentence (and you are a solution) in the position of the situation from the guarantor (division), so the division will be in the country.The country of Muhammad ﷺ, and it is a beautiful interpretation if he helped him with a resignation (a solution) in the sense of: (case), that is: a resident in a place, then this is not the same in the place of the The tongue, the dictionary, and the uniqueness of the desire.A source in the sense of the situation here is on this face, and there is no lesson for those who deny it because of its confirmation in the books of the language.Is the reference in the proof of the language, except for its name?Consideration, and this is the dear country.The partners are to come out of their current.And (the father) is a denying, and it is a great deny, as it is not necessary for that in the division of the division, so you are aware that the good and the father are great, and the best, Al -Haqqi with a category of his saying: and what was born.And who is appropriate for the division in this country that the person who is intended (the father) is a wasting - peace be upon him - for that he who took that country to reside with the residence of his son, he said: Exalted: (And when Ibrahim said, Lord, make this country safe and soften me and build me that we worship idols [Ibrahim: 35]) Then he said: (Our Lord, I have been dwelling from the same Your forbidden house [Ibrahim: 37]).And Abraham and the father of the population of that of the original country.And (what is born) is a connection and a link, and the guarantee that is stated in (a son) is a return to (the father).And what is meant: and what Abraham gave birth to the sons and offspring.This is specialized in those who have tracked his guidance, and he covers Muhammad ﷺ.In this, an illusion of the alarm about the partners from the offspring of Abraham that they are sharp from the way of their father from the neutrality, the righteousness and the supplication to the truth, the right of the right, the righteousness, the righteousness, (The most important people of Abraham for those who followed him and this prophet and those who believed [Al -Imran: 68]).He came in the name of the communication (what) in his saying: (and what he was born) without (who) with that (who) is more accumulated in the will of the sane person while he is intended here, so he referred to (who); Because (what) is more important, I want to hide the people of this prayer, so they will be surprised by the severity of the thumb to the will of the prevalence, and the one who said: Know what I put [Al -Imran: 36]) Meaning: A wondrous child.This is explained that (what) is completely dedicated to an agreement, and (who) does not use a complete denial except when Al -Farisi.(P-350) Because the power of the imperialism in (what) is attributed to the will of the group without one appointed, not to see the saying of the ruling, the deaf, the uniform: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Righteousness and what he wants: and from his children, no appointed children.And the sentence of (the human being created in a luxury), the answer to the division, which is the supply of the surah.And the human being is permissible for him to be the spectrum, which is the appearance and the saying of the philosophers, so the disappearance in it is the curiosity of the gender, and it is the goodness of it.Because his saying: (Is it calculated that no one will be appreciated by it [Al -Balad 5]) to the last verses, only in the words of others, so the general public, is the general of the people, that is Then, the Muslims were only a little alienation, and therefore there were many in the Qur’an the release of the human being intended by the disbelievers of the people.It is permissible for a certain person to be intended for it, so the definition is to be cured of the covenant, so the dog is that he is Abu Al -Ashtar, and it is said: The father of the two and his name is Asid ibn Kalla al -Jamah Such.The ten men attracted him until the ancients will be torn and the feet were not disappeared, and the intensity of the disbelief and the enmity was for the prophet ﷺ, so he went down in it (what is the right of it.[Country: 5]).It was said: He is the Walid ibn al -Mughara, and it was said: He is the father of ignorance.On the authority of a fighter: I descended in Al -Harith bin Amir Bin Nawfal, he claimed that he agreed with money on the corruption of the Prophet ﷺ.It was said: It is Amr ibn Abd al -Wadd, who was subjected to the beach on the day of the parties to enter the city, and he was killed by Ali ibn Abi Talib, the successor of the Khanduq.And there are no witnesses from the correct transmission, and the division is not permitted by the division or the context.And the creation: finding what is not in the way, and it is called a condition with a strong effect on the self, such as his saying: (He creates you in the stomachs of your mothers) And his saying: (And when it is created from the clay, as the goodness of the bird [Al -Ma’idah: 110]) He is making it changed the same thing.(P-351) and the luxury of two conquests: tiredness and intensity, and the sayings of the interpreters were prepared in the report of what is intended to be, and no one of them is brought out to the one who is on the authority He is interpreted by the luxury and between the argument that has the words, and its openness to the oath of affirmation and the denying the denial, even as if they were in the same way It is not a satellite in words that must be heal, and he will be entitled to.They have turned a blind eye to the occurrence of a verb (our creation) on their interpretation, as it is a verb (our creation) as an excuse for the human being in the infidel in In it, and that is removed from the severity of the storm and the slander, for the one who fools with the context and the appropriateness of the oath that is the level of tiredness who is obligated by the companions of the companions The gods are multiplied.Their opinion is forced in the group between the claim of the partnership of God Almighty and between their direction to God by asking for sustenance and asking for the survivor, if they suffer from the sake The death with their confessions with the first creation, so he said: (We created the human being in a luxury) is not a matter One of him is appreciated by one of it [Al -Balad: 5]) and what is meant is the proof of the restoration of the creation of the human being after the death of the resurrection and the penalty that they denied and start the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the way of the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the way The first light.So weighing this greeting and the guidance of the guidance with his saying: (We created the human being in the best of the evaluation, then we repeated it as the lower of the two: (Fig and Ziton [fig: 1]) etc.So it is (what is calculated that it will not be appreciated by it [Al -Balad: 5]): What is meant that we will not be appreciated after it after the assumption of his body, so we will be happy with him Another, so it is in the way of the division and the division of it with the saying of the Almighty: (I do not divide the Day of Resurrection [Resurrection: 1]) to his saying: (What is the right of the person: I have been able to forget his children [the Resurrection: 4]) that is: as we created it first time in a strategy of life as well For his atonement.And that appears the satelliteness of his saying: (in a luxury) because the intended theorizing between the first and second creation is that they are from the extent of God.And the perception of its saying: (in a luxury) is action that is metaphorical in the mandate, as if it is an outlook in the listener, and his counterpart is saying: (Rather, those who do not believe in the last And the distant delusion [Saba: 8] Example and puzzles from the matter on one of the interpretations of this verse.The meaning is that the luxury is a mandate for the one who is the one who is equivalent to the partner, and it is when the mind is established and the perception of perception.It is permissible to make his saying: (We have created the human being in the heart) from the acceptable heart to join it, and it is a pleasant adult, which is the severity of the people Even as if he was created in the luxury.The meaning: We have created in the infidel human.The interpretations have other interpretations in the sense of the verse that the context is not used to.
