The Quranic researcher, we descended it on the night of the destiny, this verse was completed on a great intelligence with the Qur’an, so it was open with a rival (that) and the news of it.Both of them are the methods of confirmation and piety.This possibility is beneficial for a palace, and it is a heart of a heart to the response to the entrepreneurs who have exiled to be the Qur’an.And in the guarantee of the bone and the support of the landing to it a great supervision of the Qur’an.And in the two of the Qur’an without the phenomenon of the phenomenon, there is a gesture that it is present in the recklessness of the Muslims for the severity of them.So the annexed is without the precedent of reactions to his month among them, so it is permissible for him to be wanted by the Qur’an, so that it is a verb (we descended).Because the one who was revealed in that night is the first of the first verses from the wall of the relationship, then the revelation was then returned, and then its removal returned to a successful and the Qur’an was not completed.Twenty years, but when all the Qur’an was determined in the knowledge of God, the exalted of his destiny and that it is revealed to the Prophet ﷺ as a star until he is fulfilled; His removal was to remove the first verses from it; Because what was followed by the thing is considered a first house, then the Prophet ﷺ said: “A prayer in my mosque is better than a thousand prayers, so what is the same.” The ritual, while it is attached to the Prophet, has the best of that, and that the ritual in the prohibitions of mosque will be valid as the mosque expands.And from the discipline of the journalist, the surah of the fate was placed after the wall of the relationship with the least number of verses than the structure of the structure and the wall after it; As if it is an illiterate that the destiny is in its descent, he returns to the Qur’an, which is the beginning of its descent with the chance of the relationship.It is permissible for the guerrillas to be a loyalty to the fate that was revealed in that night, which is (P-457) the fifth verses of the Foura Al-Alaq; For every part of the Qur’an is called a Qur’an, and on both nobles, it is expressing the past in the action of our descent, there is no metaphor in it.It was said: The guarantee of the Qur’an was released on each other, with a metaphor of the bite.And the verse is easy in that the first verses of the Qur’an came down to a night, which is required by the hadith of the beginning of the revelation in the two health of the two sayings of Aisha in it: The loyalty of the number of the number, “So he worshiped him at night, and it appears that the king would have come upon him to excite his void of his worship.As for the saying of Aisha.So it was intended that it came out of the cave of the rituals of the dawn after the elimination of the five verses, as we will be revealed to him in the last of that night, and that is the best of the night He said: And those who seek forgiveness with magic [Al -Imran: 17].And the night of destiny: a name that God made for the night in which the Qur’an is revealed.It appears that the first name of this name was in this verse, and it was not known to the Muslims, and that is the remembrance of this.To know it; Therefore, he commented his saying: I do not realize what is the night of destiny [Al -Qadr: 2].And the destiny: which was known as the night in addition to it in the sense of honor and virtue as he said in the surah of smoke, we descended it in a night of blessing: By God, the Almighty gave it from the blessing; That is a night, God made her honor, so he made it an appearance, as he preceded his knowledge, so he made it the principle of the one to the Prophet ﷺ.And the definition in the destiny is to know the sex.And he did not say: On a night of fate, he was the intention of making this compound with the house of the flag, so that the night is like a flag with dominance; Because the addition of the added to it with the blame with the addition of the added addition to the addition of that compound for a title for the meeting of two people in it.It was proven that the revelation of the Qur’an was in the month of Ramadan.There is no doubt that the Muslims knew that, as this surah was descended before the descent Less than that if the surah is civil; The night of the destiny here was in Ramadan, and this is supported by the correct and validation of its universe from the nights of Ramadan for every year.And more narratives that the night in which the Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet ﷺ was the night of seven ten from Ramadan.And the interpretation of the verses will come to the success of this talk in a night with a number of similar numbers in all of the years or dispersed in the years?And in a single of all of my loyalty, or does not come out of the ten days of it?Is it a special one with a night and a ritual, as it was the first time, or not to be specialized in that?What is meant by the honor of the night, which was the beginning of the Qur’an in which another?Its removal is a blessed mourning; Because the greatness of the verb requires that it choose to rhythm, the grace of the obstacles and the place; So the choice of the grace of the abusers for his removal is reported from the authority of his destiny with God, the Almighty, as he said: He does not touch him except the purified [Al -Waqi'a: 79] The purchases.
