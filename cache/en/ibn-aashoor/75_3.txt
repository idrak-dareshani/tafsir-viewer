The Quranic researcher (I do not swear on the Day of Resurrection, nor do I swear by the soul, the human being is that the human being is that we will not collect his bones with me, and we will be unable By the oath, it is not an important thing that will be reminded of it, so that the soul of the Samaid is to be honored, as it is presented in the number of modests.On the day of the resurrection, it is a consumption of the feet of the surah and the day of the Day of Resurrection.When the division in the saying of Abu Tamam: Your children are that they are overwhelmed and a milestone that leads, lightning and light (p-338), as it is presented when he said: Arab Qur’an [Al -Zukhruf: 1] in Surah Al -Zakhar.The prohibition of the division of it in terms of the illusion of the one that the speaker is concerned that he will be divided with it, then the division is left to be afraid of the sem.With it, that is, I do not swear by my best for me, and that is a severity of the affirmation of the division, and it is presented with the saying of the Almighty (so I will not be divided by the case) Al -Waqiqa.The resurrection) by replacing it as a difference of what is in it in the justice of God and the virtue of its grace and what it is attended by the angels and the blessed souls.Once, the saying of the Almighty (and the day of the resurrection is returned to the most severe torment [Al -Baqarah: 85]) in the surah of the cow.Because it is an indication of the answer, as it is possible: to gather the bones of the human being, meaning the human being that we will not collect his bones.In the words (they said) because it is contrary to the Words in Al -Ma’arf.Sheikh Ali Al -Nuri in the relief of the benefit, and the Shatby was not mentioned.Divide.The nomads are the nomads.On the authority of the accounting, and its day is its thinking and its breathtaking hadith.On what you missed and deleted, his soul is blamed for evil, because he did it and for the good of (P-339), it was not more than it, so this is a good soul that is good.The day of resurrection was only for its honor.And what is meant is the imam in the world for a day that the repentance and piety will arise, and it is not intended for the last day of the last, when he says (O I wish you came to my life [Al -Fajr: 24].And the appropriateness of the division with it with the day of resurrection is that it is the soul of the loudness in that day.On the authority of some of the interpreters, that (I do not divide), it is intended by the number of the oath, so it is the soul of the soul, which is blamed for the deeds of good.And his saying (that is, the human being, that we will not collect his bones), etc.Dellowing on the answer to the division, as the answer is able to make your bones and send you.And the definition of (the human) is the definition of gender, and its fall in the context of the denial that is in the sense of negation requires the general one, and it is a general of knowledge that is in which there is a person in which the people are so The believers are a little.The meaning is: I count the infidel person.And the sentence (that we will not collect its bones) is a compound from the (that) the diverted, the light that is the light that is the (if) the broken.And the name (that) is the guarantee of a deleted one.And the sentence after (that) is a news from the guarantee of the affair, so it makes it (that) with its name and telling it a prevailing spoiler of the verb.And the fearful makes (that) with its parts in the first act of the verb - that is, because it is a source - and it is appreciated by a second act.This is that one of the properties of the actions of the hearts is the permissibility of the entry of (that) that is the most important one after it, so the verb seeks to (that) and tell it about it.It came with a rhythm (no) that indicates the affirmation of the negation of the story of the inconsistency of the entrepreneurs, the gathering of the gathering of the bones after their blood and dispersal.Al -Qarbi said: I got down in Uday bin Rabia - Al -Sawab Ibn Abi Rabiaa - He said to the Prophet ﷺ: O Muhammad, tell me about the day of resurrection, and he said: Eden: If I had this day, I would not believe you or God gathered the bones, then this verse was revealed, not you said: The reason for the descent is not the one who is given.(P-340) and the bones: as a whole of the body, but it was dedicated to the remembrance of the story of his sayings (whoever revives the bones and is a thief [Yass: 78] (if we are bones [Al -Israa: 49]) (If we are a lavish bones [Al -Nazidat: 11]) They took refuge in the acceptance of the acceptance of the bones for the return after the weariness, that it is impossible to return the restriction.The proofs of the restoration of the bones require that the restoration of the severity of the body is equal to the return of the bone, and in that is a sufficiency of the recovery with the briefing.The one who is separated from the atoms of God is known to them, and he is one of the words of our scholars, so he did (Najd) And if the resurrection was with the creation of other bodies on the images of the mortal bodies, whether it was a foolish creation or a start from the admiration of the ears on what was mentioned in some of the people.The act of (Najam) is a slogan for the creation that is on the image of the body that is bored.And the appropriateness of its questioning the problems of the words that I want its heroes to avoid entering the entry with them in the confusion of the mission of the mission, and for that, there is no And then the scholars of Islam differed in how to return the bodies when the Baath.And the imam of the two sacreds was seized, and the verses of the Qur’an were restored in it that reconciled to the two things.And (yes) is a navigator for the negation, which is indicated by it, and we will not collect his bones, so it was blessed, but its bones are combined with the disagreement of those who are in the sense of gathering.And (Qadirin) is a state of the guerrilla in the deleted action after (yes), which is indicated by his saying (that we will not be gathered), that is, we are in the case His Lebanon.It is permissible to be (in) the heroes of the two negatives: the negation, which was reported by the denial of the heart of its saying (that is, the human being), and the negation that is in the man With a dirt, that is, but to calculate us, they are able, because it is that (we will not collect his bones) that we do not appreciate the collection of his bones, and it will be (Qadir).The estimated, and amended in a comment (Qadirin) on the authority of it: Qaden on the collection of his bones to Qadiren on the authority of his children because he is the most separated by the one who is in the way How to resurrect and return.And to take into account this suffering is amended by raising: “Qaddar”, in appreciation: we are Qaddon, and he was not read by raising.(P-341) and the Evidence: The evaluation of the thing and the perfection of creation said: The same (and the soul and what was settled by it [the sun: 7]) and he said in this surah (He was created and the level of the resurrection: 38).And I want to re -establish the creation of Lebanon, and it is a sufficiency, so the settlement is a manner from the creation, because it is obligatory, so it is not the same, and it is not the same and the one who has been said.Hope (who was created and settled [Al -Ala: 2]).And Lebanon is the briefing of the hands and the two men, or the framework of those Sabeans.It is the name of a collection of annexes.And if it was the younger of the members located in the end of the body, it was its level as a fabrication of the equivalent of all the bodies to appear to be the equivalent of the bodies What was accepted by her as she says: The wind fractured the bond of clients, as it is all the clients.And among them is their saying: This thing is with his family, that is, with the rope that he is tightened, as a result of all things.Likewise, their saying: It is for you with his tossing, that is, with his rope that he is tightened.
