The Quranic researcher (P-294) O, the developer He separated from his vision, and he returned to Khadjjah, and he said: They turned me, they said, or he said, or he said, or he said: They grabbed me, and they will be disturbed, and they were disturbed by the narrators, So I was impressed, and it was revealed.And he has passed by his words, O, the smile [Al -Muzammil: 1] What is in this call of honor and kindness.And the consequence: a name that is active from being stoned, if the wore is wore, then it is the origin of the trial, the vita of the sign is tweet to their approach to the penetration as it was in the past.And the ritual: the fracture of the sign: the garment that wears the garment of the garment, which is woven for the embodiment of the embodiment that is called a slogan.In the hadith “Al -Ansar is a slogan and the people are wicked”.The description of (the inattentive) is a truth, and it was said that it is metaphor in the sense: the one who is in the prophecy, as it is said that the glory is said and the one who said it is what is said to him O managing [Al -Muzammil: 1], that is: O dress, the disturbance of the prophecy and its disturbance.And the resurrection of the one who is taught to it is not used in its right; Because the Prophet ﷺ was not when he was revealed to him with this as a sleeping nor a rumor, nor is he commanded that he gets to rise to his feet, but he is the one who is used in the matter With a warning or a vicinity.And this recovery was popular in the action of resurrection until the meaning of the hurry in the work became one of the suffering of the subject of the resurrection as a matter The lean is the verb of the actions of the hurricane.The use of the action of resurrection in the sense of horror may be a fabrication of the necessity of resurrection from determination and concern as in the verse, he said in the scouts: the resurrection of the resurrection.The wild meaning of the Kinary meaning may be the same as the saying of Bin Bin Muhuan Al-Tamimi from the poets of Hamas: (p-295), the Lord of the Beat The men of alive and west, then if it is connected to the verb of the resurrection, which is in this sense, a sentence is obtained from their entirety, the meaning of the wise in the verb, and the meaning of the verb, Hassan ibn al -Mundhir: ؎ On what he gave me a deem ∗∗∗ Kakhnzir who is empty in the ash and the saying of the poet, and he is one of the gravity of grammarians, and he did not know.People about it with his sword ∗∗∗ and he said, “No, no from a path to Hindi, and he benefited from fulfillment (so warn), commenting on the benefit of motivation and honesty with the rhythm of the warning.The act of (Qoss) is a house that is obligatory, and the separation (so warn) on it shows what is meant by the matter of resurrection.And the meaning: O you who are scattered from the fearful to see the king of the gospel, do not be afraid and accept the warning.And Al -Dahir: That this verse is the first thing that came down in The matter is the case; Because the wall of the relationship did not include an order with the supplication.And the surah of the miserable, which guarantees that it is preceded by the supplication of his saying in it, that we sent a messenger to you, a witness to you [Al -Muzammil: 15] [Al -Muzzammil: 11].Rather, they were distorted after they informed them that he was a messenger from God to them and calmed down the matter with warning; Because the warning collects the suffering of the warning of something that does not fit and its consequences, the warning is true by the progress before the matter of the reactions of the verb; Because the evacuation is presented to the dissolution, and the definition is presented on the mountain of interest, and that the majority of people are the same as the one that needs warning and warning.And the act of (warning) is deleted to benefit the general, that is: all people warn all of them, and all people are not only a cheek - may God be pleased with it - then it is true With the evil.
