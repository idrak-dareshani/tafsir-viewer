The Quranic researcher (P-137) The name is a name for the word “Bassam of God, the formula of this name on a substitute for the two letters The form of a verb that is ahead of the adultery of the doctrine of its substance from the forefathers of a sentence or an additional cruise forestry, from what the people of the people who are pronounced from the people For the purpose of lighting for the many times of that year.Tabbah, as they said in the proportions to the servant of "Shamsi", the fear of the dressing with the proportions to a slave or a sun, and in the proportions to the servant of the house, "the servant of you Hadmat “Hadrami” said Sibuyeh in the door of addition, that is, the proportions to the addition of the names: they may make the proportions in the addition in the name of the house of Ja`far.The first and the other and do not bring it out of their forests to know, uh, so whoever left behind from the birth of the Arabs came and used this way in the story The year for the purpose of the confusion, and that is from the chest of Islam, so the way is Arabic in Arabic.The shepherd said: They left a saying that there is no god but God.So the origin of the name of God said: In the name of God, then the birth of the generated by God: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful And the view that is one of the prohibitions of the Most Merciful, and their saying is spreading: in the sense of God, he said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.It is derived from the least of a source, and it is a source of an action.The son of Ibn Harun Al-Tunsi explained the custody of Ibn Al-Hajib in the chapter of the call to prayer on the developer (P-138) in the book “Al-Awqit”: The actions that are offered from the names of the seventh: In the name of God, and he praised in “Glory be to God”, and he was in “live in prayer”, and he was decreased in “there is no way and no power except with God,” And he was made if he said, “I have made your ransom”, and the goodness increased in “God prolonged your meeting, and the tears in“ God Almighty is your glory.” And when many of the imams of religion, he said that it is a sign of all the lights, without light, or some of the lights, insisted on the interpreter, that it will be made.When those who enemy are a sign of some light.And the words are confined to it in three of the pharaohs: the first in Bayan is a verse of the lights or not.The second is in the ruling on the one who has been in it.The third is the interpretation of its own sediment.As for the first researcher, it is that there is no dispute between the Muslims that he memorized “in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Silman, and it is in the name of God, the Most Merciful A matter with a mind in which he does not start in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Its drawings who wrote the crusters in the ills of the light are not the same as a wall of light, as it is taken from the conversation of Ibn Abbas with Uthaman, and it has gone in the eighth.They differed that it was written in the Mushaf in the first surah of Fatah, and that is not a position of the chapter of the surah with what before it, but they dispersed that it is the same Al -Fatihah and the first of the lights are not very bad, in the sense that the difference between them is not in its existence as a Qur’an, but it is in the disturbance of its Qur’an as it is the same as the one who indicated to it.The beginning, so Malik, Al -Awazi, and the jurisprudence of the city, the Levant, and the Basra, were gone, and it was said that the abuse of Abdullah ibn Amr and Ibn Shihab is from the jurisprudence The light is a part of the surah of the mill, and the Shafi’i went in one of his saying, Ahmad, Isaac, Abu Thawar and the jurisprudence of Makkah and the father of the The first surah of Al -Fatihah in particular, and Abdullah bin Mubarak and Al -Shafi’i went to one of his saying, and it is the most correct of him that it is a sign of every surah.And it was not reported from Abu Hanifa from the jurisprudence of the koff in it, and the owner of the scout was taken from it that it is not from the light at it, so it is in it in the one who said: The light is the correct one.Abd al -Hakim said that he said that the vastness of the wicked with it with the conquest in the public prayer, and its challenges in the privileges of the light in the way of the conquest.And I am more, I say: He did not see the restriction in the prayer, divided into reading.As for the argument of the money of your money and those who agreed with it, they have your question: one of them is one of the ways of view, and the second is one of the methods of the effect, and the third is from the way of the Arab lord.As for the first property, the ownership has a long article for the judge, Abu Bakr al -Baqalani, and Abu Bakr bin Al -Arabi followed him in the rulings of the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an and the judge of the Qur’an.“The Sharaf”, Al -Baqalani said: If the name was from The Qur’an was the way of its proof, either the frequency or the one, and the first is false, because if it was established with the frequency, as it is from the Qur’an, the knowledge of the righteousness of the It is in it between the nation, and the second is also false, because the news of the one is not beneficial except for the thought, so if we made it a way to prove the Qur’an to remove the Qur’an from the cousin, and it is a way That is thinking, and if it is permissible for that, the allegation of the al -Rawadi would be rewarded that the Qur’an entered the increase, the decrease, the change, and the prohibition.It is the words of the charter, which is the condolences that he has in his words, clear to whom he has a practice of the human being, and its conditions do not need to be for the sake The project does not need it.Abu Bakr bin Al -Arabi increased in the rulings of the Qur’an, and he said: It is enough for you that it is not from the Qur’anic Qur’an in it, and the Qur’an is not different in it.And the servant of Al -Wahhab increased and he said: The Messenger of God has been among the Qur’an, and it was not equal, and it was not his habit in his two softening, with a disgraceful, and the one who has been disturbed by the one.And the two; Therefore, we cut off from the Qur’an that was not transmitted to us and our authority is not transferred to us.The name of Hamid was shown by the Messenger of God, a cure.Ibn al -Arabi said in Al -Aridah: The judge Abu Bakr ibn al -Tayyib was not spoken of jurisprudence except in this question, especially because it is attached to the origin.He knew this guide, Abu Hamid Al -Ghazali, in the descriptive, and he said: He denied that the name of the Qur’an from the Qur’an also, if it is proven with the frequency, it is necessary that it is necessary that it is necessary that it does not Blanting, and if it is proven by the ones, the Qur’an becomes a belief, he said: It is not said that the time of something is not from the Qur’an a number and the numbers do not need to be established because it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not The Qur’an, because we answer that this, even if it is a nominal (P-140), is that the name of the name is written in the line of the Qur’an, they are offended by the Qur’an, so it is not for us.The ruling that it is not from the Qur’an except by the evidence, and the words come in that the evidence is what it is, so it has proven that the words that the judge did not have to be upon him, His interpretation and is not hidden that he is in his expansion to the exported, as he became a reference to the gazelle and the pride of religion to the drawing of the poison in the crushing, That is when speaking on the perpetrator of Al -Shafi’i.Ibn Rashd was punished in the beginning of the Mujahid, as the words of Al -Baqalani and Al -Ghazali are in words, so it is not liberated, so we do not lengthen it.As for the second property, which is the one who is more than the effect, we do not find in the authenticity of the Sunnah, which testifies that the name is a verse of the Qur’an and the evidence Six: The first indication: What is narrated by Malik in Al -Muwat from Al -Ala'a ibn Abd al -Rahman to Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “God Almighty said: My servant, we describe it to me and her half of my servant and my servant what he asked, the servant says to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Fatihah: 2] So I say Hamdani, the servant of the sake of God, etc.Prayer, and the guidance of the evidence from him that he did not remember “the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.” The second: The hadith of Abi bin Kaab in Al -Muwati and Al -Sahihin that the Messenger of God ﷺ said to him: Do I not teach you a wall, and he did not go down in the teeth, nor in the annexation of the one who is in the same way.Who is mosque?He said: Yes, when he was close to al -Kharj, he said to him: How do you read if you open the prayer?Abi said: I read the praise to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Fatihah: 2] until I came to the last, so this is an indication that he did not read from it.The third: There is no Muslim and the Sunnah of Abu Dawood and the Sunnah of the Women from Anas Bin Malik from many ways They open up with “praise be to God, Lord of the two worlds“ do not remember ”the name of God, the Most Merciful.Al -Rabaa: The hadeeth of Aisha in Saheeh is a Muslim and the Sunnah of Abi Dawood said: “The Messenger of God was open to prayer by the greatest and the rule of the Lord of the Lord.” Fifth: What is in the Sunnah of Al -Tarmahi and Al -Nasa’i on the authority of Abdullah ibn Mughafal, he said: The Most Merciful.Live to the time of Malik, in which the Messenger of God and the Caliphs, the Rashids and the princes, prayed behind them the companions and the people of knowledge, and no one is heard in the name of God.Agency, and does a scientist say that some of the surahs are a secret and some are a secret, so the frequencies have obtained the fact that the Prophet and the Khaneb did not make it in the way, so they did not.The surah, and if they wore it, the people did not fail.There is another indication that they did not remember here, and it is the hadith of Aisha, “At the beginning of the revelation to the Messenger of God ﷺ, and it is an arrogant one who is spilled to the prophet, and that is the saying And he said: Read, the Messenger of God said and said: I am not a reader until he said, and the third thickened me, then he said: Read in the name of your Lord, who was created [Al -Aqal: 1] God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Read in the name of your Lord.The third is the one who is the one who is the narrative of the Arab world, so the saying comes in it on the observance of the saying of those who say that the poison is a sign of the surah of Al -Fatiha He is the most merciful, the Most Merciful in the words of no way, which is not between them.In his interpretation and answered him with his saying: The relic of the affirmation is a lot in the Qur’an, and if the affirmation of its place is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.And I pushed his answer that the righteous, even if it has the places of a Hamida in the words of the vicious, such as the evidentity, and the status of lamentation or the reciprocity, or the confirmation, not to be sure.It is suitable for it for the purposes of repeatedness, nor is it confirmation because it is not denying that it is a merciful and merciful, and because the affirmation of the righteousness is not that it is not.So, it is clear that it is a frequency of the word in the words of the existence of the necessity of expressing its significance with the way of the name of the name without the oppression, and that is the same There is no time between the two passengers, and you have learned that they were enemy in the words of the words of the words of the many times, and the proximity is between It is forbidden.Al -Baydawi answered that the joke of the repeated here is the reason for the verge of praise, so the Slakuti said, this indicated this to the response to what the people said: Al -Fatihah for the obligation to be repeated, and it is an unimaginable answer because if the explanation is a judge with the remembrance of the mercy of the Most Merciful.(P-142), which is at the beginning of Al-Fateh from these two classes that the conqueror will become like this (in the name of God, praise be to God), etc.And I see in the use of the Arabs of the Arab Light to be the observance of the saying of those who say that the name is a sign of every surah, and this is the one who arises from this saying The Qur’an is all similar, and that is what is not praised in the words of the abolition, as the affair is that sophistication falls into the savings, but the knowledge of the scholars of the rhetoric may be promised The openness of the words and its conclusion, and they mentioned that the sacrifice of the light and its ends and a response to the best of the faces of the Bayan and its fullness, so how it is justified to claim that it is a prayer.With the fact that the general abolition of the speeches, poets, and writers compete with the art of their creativity, and they are tired of those who are obligated in his words, so that you are in the words In the words of speech.As for the argument of the Shafi’i, and whoever agreed with it is a verse from the surah of Al -Fatihah, many things are many.The one who interferes and is out of a place The conflict and the weakness of the bond, or its deity, except for two things: they are many hadiths, including what Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet has to pray and peace be upon him.God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.What is between the two burials is the words of God.On the authority of the correctness, the authentic hadith does not oppose the authentic hadith.It was correct for some of his ways, and he was stabbed in it, in which he narrated that the son of my son, Malika, did not prove it, and the son of the son of my father was not proven that he is the mother of peace.He narrated what he violated, on the authority of Islam, Zakaria has stated in his footnote to the interpretation of the oval that he did not see the word, but it is the word, but it is the word (In the name of God) is a sign of one, so it is not taken from it from the conqueror, on the authority of this, that this leads to the proof of the Quran On the authority of the two burials, the words of God, the answer is that it is not required except that the name is a Qur’an, and this is not a conflict in it, and as for the places of the places of the one who is in the place Its readers (P-143) responds to it, so it is a matter of the narration of the readers and the correct Sunnahs, so he returns to the precedent evidence.They did not write the names of the light and its being is an angel or a civilian in the journalist, and that this is one of the makers of the late, and it is the wise of the words of Abd al -Hakim in It was proven that some of the predecessors wrote that, as it is the appearance of the words of the interpreters, the fundamentalists, and the readers, as in the different signs of the signs of Quslani, who is the one who is required.That is because they were not seen on the increase in what the predecessor did.For the ink of the Qur’an, it is mentioned that the viewer in the descendants of the previous one is that it was in the ink of one color, and it was not a fascist.He was asked how the reader of the Prophet was, so he was a tidal and then read: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.In this, because the guarantee of a reader and a destiny extended a lion to Anas, but it came with the name on the face of the representative The reader of the month of the name.And the Hajj of Abdullah ibn al -Mubarak and the second of the words of Al -Shafi’i, what was narrated by a Muslim from Anas.We said: What I have laughed at you, O Messenger of God?And consensus on the fact that what is between the two burials is the words of God and for the companions of the companions in the Qur’an with their kernels that they do not enter into the Qur’an, and it is not from it, and it is not from it Ain in Al -Fateh.The answer to the hadith is that we are forbidden to be read by the name that it is from the surah, but it opened with it at the will of the reading, because it sings from the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the I am able to seek refuge in the name of God and delete the attachment of the verb, and his pregnancy is appointed to the like, because he narrated that he was the son of Malik, the son of Malik.The Messenger of God is a name in prayer.If they were interpreted by what we have been first, it is obligatory for Anas in his narration, forcing it that must be stolen.And the right truth in the matter of the name in the ills of the light, that it was written for the separation between the light to be the chapter on the right to the sake of the Qur’an, and to the sake The Qur’an, and Abu Dawood (P-144) narrated in its Sunnah and the trauma and corrected it on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said: I said to Yaqman ibn Afan: The hundred and the running is from the second, so you made them in the seventh long and did not write between them, "in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.The verses, so they pray for some of those who were writing for him and saying to him: Put this verse with the wall in which he is mentioned in it and so, or it is revealed to him, and the verse is upon him.It was the result of the first of what was revealed to the city, and it was a light from the last of the Qur’an and its story was young, and it was a young man with a story, so it was not the same.We are from her, so I thought that she was from her, so whoever put her in the seventh long and I did not write among them a line.It is written among the light, other than the enforcement and the righteousness of the Qur’an in one of the Qur’an in one of the people of Uthaman, and that it was not written in the princes of Al -Sara Bin Thabit in the disagreement of Abi Bakr, as it was for each of the championships, as it was presented in the eighth offered by the eight of the provisions of this interpretation.It is a verse of the first of every surah, not, or a verse of the first surah of Fatah, only, or not with a verse of the first thing; The readers agreed on the readings of the name at the Shiites in the reading of Surah, one of the first of which is uninterrupted.And they narrated that of those who have come, but those of whom they narrate or say that the name is a verse of the first of every surah, other than the brightness of them The name in the ills of the light is a duty with them, there is no referral in the prayer and others, and those who do not see the name are a sign of all the illuminations of the light, or what is the other Al -Bassala is at the beginning of the surah at the hurricane in the reading of Surah, other than a precedent with the readers of Sura, before it, he was raised with the consequences of the effect of the ritual The likeness to a murderous act is an action that similar to it to seek the readers to call the writing.So their readers will be a desirable matter to the despair in the readers of what the companions did to the companions of the companion, the rule of the luster is the same With resignation and the counterpart of the elaboration and the pride between some of the light from the last detail, and they are not lined up in the readings of the obligatory prayer, and these are the rituals of the ritual of the prayer.Their readers of what he ended with them, so they understood them from the matter of the name of the dignity or the imitation.With this, you know that he does not want to be taken from their readers, saying that the name is a sign (P-145) from the first of every surah as the owner did.And they differed in the readings of the name in the other places in the reading of a surah of the first, that is, in the readings of the name between the two suits.Forehd on a sophisticated one in the most famous narratives of him and the son of Amir, Abu Amr, and Hamza, Jacob, and a backwardness, do not lock between the two chapters and the one who is the one who is the one who is in the way The writers of the journalist are specific to the appetite, and by their pregnant women, the drawing of the name in the Qur’an is that it is a mark on the sake of the surah, not on the chapter, for the sake of the seller The chapter is between the surah, which he followed, as it was written in the first surah of Fatah, so they were made by them, because they gathered between what they narrated from the authority of the authority Temid, and their opinion is that the name is not a sign of the first of every surah.And they said about Nafaa, Ibn Katheer, Asaim, Al -Kisa’i, and Abu Jaafar, who are lined with the two supers Follow their predecessor, as all of them are not among the people of the guidance, and perhaps they repeated the intention of the Temidan with the liking of the writers of the journalist in the notice of the rituals of the light of the light Kiss it.And the Muslims agreed to leave the name in the first surah of light, and the face of that was revealed, and the imams directed it to the face of another, and it came to the first in the first place.Al -Jahiz mentioned in the Bayan and the Tabayin that the Historian of the Sadous Al -Basri heard a man saying, “The Commander of the Faithful is returned to the parachute.Who is made by a historian if it is true of it, but it is on the salt and the slippery, and it is not very serious.In this, it indicates that the disagreement of the readers of the readers in the readings of the name in the positions of the Qur’an is a shift and a connection, as it is presented, there is no effect in it in the ritual of the ritual, Her readings in prayer runs on the rulings of the view in the evidence, and the readers of the readers are with a number of evidence of jurisprudence, but their readings are narrators and the Sunnah The Qur’an is without a call to adopt the rulings of the narration of the Qur’an from frequency and without it, nor to a garment, fibruma, and seduction, for the reader reads as it was narrated from the one who is narrated from the one (p-46) He looks at the ruling on what he reads from the necessity of his being as he read or the incumbent of the necessity, their work will run in their prayers on their tears in the jurisprudence of the jurisprudence, The mistake of those who think that the difference of jurisprudence is clear in the proof of the bishop and its numbers is based on the different readers, as the tolerance of the owner of the scouts is clear in his life We coordinate the doctrine of jurisprudence.Rather, the diligents differed for the sake of the evidence that is presented by its two, and the agreement between them and among the readers of their voices is mostly in this way of the question The saying among the people of that era in what his jurisprudence said in the books, or the guidance of evidence that the mujahids are delivered from the chests of their teeth from Before the appearance of the Mujahid, the same as the precedent of Nafaa ibn Abi Naim to the numbers of the remembrance of the bulk before he says your money with the last part of it; Because Malik receives evidence of the negation of the part of the city of the city, and for them, or from their hooks, it will receive Nafaa ibn Abi Naam.And when we had imitated our money and reassured us to its path in the abandonment of the time of the name, a verse of the first surah of the cow, it was not true to us.To interpret it here, and that we refer it to the words of the words of the Almighty in Surah al -Nimam, it is from Solomon, and it is in the name of God, the Most Merciful: All of them are all the people who did not care about the word in this position, we have traced them, as it became the desired of the interpreters.And he knew that the one who is attached to the mourning in the name of God is deleted, which is estimated here.So the mourning of the mourning was deleted in it, as a reward for the century, and the Qur’an said that the magic of Pharaoh is in the magic of the magic of the magic in the magic of the magic in the magic of Sarh With his saying, “So they strengthened them and disobeyed them, and they said with the honor of Pharaoh” and the owner of the scout mentioned that The people of the ignorance were saying in the start of their work, “in the name of the Lati in the name of the dear”, so the mourning is a way for a work for the verb of the deleted and the one who is a deleted and the deleted Permanently like the circumstances that fall into news, and the consequence of the suspended, the work in which the work in which it was made is mentioned in which it is based on it, so that it is a special act The meaning of the work in which it is in it without the public attachment, like: start, because the consort indicates the attachment is the action that is the one who is in which it is the one who is in the past That the ancient is the verb that indicates that action, and does not take place in this disagreement that occurred between the grammarians in the fact that the circumstances are attached to it Or a verb like or stable that that disagreement in the exact circumstances is a news or a constructive conditions on the opposite of (P-147), it is required to be able to do the name of the name And the current, and the requirement of the ability of the verb, which is its origin in the work, because what is here is a lukewarm, and the origin is in which the verb is to be transgressed, and it is attached to it, and it is attached to it, By the name that all of his work will be a comparison of the blessing of the name of God Almighty, so this is a people who are able to attach the neighbor, and it is a sign of the verb, and it is a sign of the verb.To perish the time to the verb, so that this one is less general, so the general verb is appreciated Get on it.This estimation is one of the estimates that the readers have indicated as the saying of the Arabs with the kindness and the sons, and the saying of the traveler with the solutions of God And the saying of the Arabs when the wedding is buried, “with the blessing and the blessing, and on the righteous,” and for that, the perception of the verb is clear.I have been helping this deletion with a vagina, which is the righteousness of the name, to start with it every street in a verb, so he does not resort to a contradiction to the memorization of the Qur’an.Here, before the brevity, because it has been removed from what he might be expressed in the words, with the disagreement of the attitudes of the stable circumstances, we have no good, for you are good, so they do not They say: The best of you is for you, and for that, you are the same as the saying of it, “You are like the night who is my blessing” from equality without the briefing, meaning what is in it.And if the attachment was deleted, he was appointed to be appreciated in his position, and he is attached to it, as is the origin of the words; As there is no intention of here to benefit the bishop, and the invitation of the owner of the scouts, his estimation is delayed, deepening, without acceptance, not even when the case is the case of According to the original.And the BA of Mabbis is the accompaniment, and it is the adhesion as well.The meaning, and as it is in its saying, “I am alerting to the father” and their saying “with the kindness and the children” and this meaning is the most suffering of the Baa and its most famous, he said: And for him to return the scandal of its suffering, and for that the owner of the scouts said: This face is that of the clothes, the Arabs are the best, that is, the best of making the mos to the god It is in it from the increase in blessing with the courage of all the parts of the verb to its high name.And the name is not made by sense, or meant by her characters or her type.The insight made him derived from the heavens, which is raising because it is achieved in the calls of the name, and if it is a pioneer, then it is the origin of the name (p-148) The flags are placed only for something that is concerned with it, and this is a reluctance of the origin and the majority, otherwise the flags may be placed because of what is concerned with it as they said, “Fajr”.So the origin of his formula is with the Basrin from the wave deficiency, so it is either a poison with a lord Lighting or for a lot of settlement, and for that the Arabization of the rest of the letters, because if his mother was omitted for a sacrifice, the Arabs were not able to As in the direction of a judge and a neighborhood, when the Arabs took place on the remaining letters, which were dwelled, they said that its silence was to the weary, and it is the first word and they were overwhelmed by the gossip of the lord; As Arabs do not improve the dominance with a dumping letter to the acquisition of their lines of lowering, and they have spent the absence of a second and a second break from the time The three is because the names that remain in the omission of two letters and blood that are not disturbed by gravity, and in this indication that the hampered is not overwhelmed to be overwhelmed by Let them be in hand, blood and tomorrow.And they took his origin, as well as his collection on names with the lords of verbs, and it appeared in the last of it, and it is a fluffy of the wow, And that he gathered on my names, and he is the collection of gathering with the weighted deeds by the slurring of the gather in the mother of the word, and it is permissible to reduce it as it is in my righteousness and my safety, and that it is a young man.And that the act of it was called, and it is a clear argument that its origin is from the wave deficiency.And that it is said to be called as a guidance; Because they were forced into a verb, as the wicked waw, and a thousand people, spoil the conquest, and sought the words of the saying of my father, the one who is the one who is good Blessed ∗∗∗ God has influenced him with Harraka, and a son lives in it: There is no argument in it to invoke his color as a language.The wise is that his writings with the hope indicate that it is different.And when the writing does not comment on the novel, perhaps those who are They wrote it with the same people who thought it is short, on the fact that (P-149) is the measuir of writing with the thousands, releasing because it is and only if he wants the numbers of the line.And the Basrin sees it is more likely to be in the direction of this memory.The Kufic went to the fact that his origin is a name by breaking the waw, because it is from the heavens and it is the mark, so the waw was deleted and the ghost of the connection was removed from it.It is codified by that to reduce it in the connection, as if they had seen that there is no face to derive it from the heavens, because it may be used for the things of the things that are not.The Kufic saw it is more likely from the side of the derivative without the departure, as the thunderbolt of the connection was not guided by its entry into what its chest was omitted.And they responded to the visionary in its way that it is to be able to be that of the wealth of the heart that is that the origin of the name is the name of the name.So she was made to be listed with that to his omitting and responded in his frankness in the position that he was deleted from him because he was whispering with his origin, and he answered that, and he answered that Because it is the disagreement of the original and that the heart does not require the word in the path of its way, otherwise it is not known for the origin of that word.The scholars of the language agreed on the fact that the vision is the one with which the increase is known from the original and the transmission from others.And we are bound in the book of boredom and the bee that no saying of the Basilians and the Kufi is a ponded that the grammarians did, and it was not valid for the Arabs, and that it is not the same, and it is not the same.And he lengthened his harm to them, and she is a wondrous woman, and he said: So, ask the people of the remembrance if you do not know [Al -Nahl: 43], but I will not be the same It was said: In the name of God, and he did not say that God is the
