The Quranic researcher did not see the birds, according to them, and they will hold what they hold, except the Rahman.Without [King: 15] Skilled in the indications of God Almighty, with the expansion of the struggles, and it was transmitted from the significance of the conditions of humanity and their world, to the significance The conditions of the bird in the system of its movements in the event of its fold; As you do not walk on the ground as it is in the movements other than it on the ground, it is the most powerful significance of the strange manufacture of God who is alienated with it.And the memory is included in the wonders of the creation of the goodness in its fold on the beacon of the sofa because the three descriptions of the saying of it are beneficial from his saying, and they are on the authority of their words.The image of the good movements of the Samaids, so that they will deny them to the rights of the people, perhaps they forgive them from the way of the severity The Tunsi or the Maghribi, for example, if he traveled to the country of Hindi or to the country of Sudan, then he saw the fulleh, and he is the mind of the mind.The man is one of the people of the Indian between the fulle Al -Sahaf said: Do they not look at the camel, how were they created [Al -Ghashiyyah: 17] and to the sky how was it raised [Al -Ghashiyyah: 18] and to the mountains, how was it erected [Al -Ghashi: 19] 20], and he said, and in yourself, do you not see [Adh -Dhariyat: 21].(P-38) I saw some of those who witnessed the sea while he was old, and he did not witness him before, as he owned him from the wonder that he is not one of the people.This softens in this surah is contrary to what is in the forefront of this verse from the surah of the bee in its saying, did they not see the birds of the heavens in the atmosphere of the sky that is not [Bees: 79].This, according to what is required by the two shrines, the goodness of the beekeeper is a power before the king of the king, so when their minds woke up in it to look at what is in the goodness of the good They are overlooked and walked in this surah, the name of the sneaks, with the increase in the male of three descriptions.The land and the bird are like that, so if the bird flew, it is transmitted to a strange condition, contrary to the rest Excellency flies with his two sides [Al -Anam: 38] after his saying and no dungeon [Al -Anam: 38] in the Surah Al -Anam to intend to perform that state.And the second description: grace, which is a description of the weighing of the name of the actor, which is derived from the class, and it is the universe of a multiple, traditions of affiliated and the one, and it is the one, and it is the one, and it is the one, and it is the one who said: In the sense, they chose, as God told the angels, and we are the pure ones [Al -Saffat: 165] and he said: The exalted in the body, so remember the name of God upon it [36].It is said: He described them if he made them equal in the stand, and in the hadith of Ibn Abbas in the crimes, the Messenger of God ï·º passed by a grave that is based on his saying, and he described it.What is meant here is that the bird is clear, and the verb is deleted for his knowledge from the running description on the bird, as the bird does not make the things that are described When the bird, the bird, if it flew, is simplified by his wings, that is, its stretching, then described the feathers of the wing.So he described it, and he was presented with his words, and the bird is a grace [Al -Nur: 41] in Surah Al -Nur.In the middle of the two wings, the bird enables the bird, so it is the same as the hands of the sacrifices in the water.The third description: and they are caught while it is a kind of grace of the act of the verb on the young name of the act in the detection and the benefit of the equity in the impermissibility With his compassion, the two offended in the name and the actual effective, which is one of the improvement of the connection.(P-39) and the arrest: against the simplicity.And what is meant by it is against the description that was removed before it, as that row was honest in the sense of the simplicity and the act of the deleted here is the eye of the deleted The two wings of their wings when they can religion from their south to the increases from the sake of the air to the one in the good.The verb is the one who is in the past in the arrest of that wondrous situation, which is the case of the opposite of the two wings, as the opposite is the opposite.He came in the description of the bird with (Safat) with the form of the name because the row is the most of the most important ones at the bird, so the name indicates the stability, and it is in the righteousness To the verb of the work, that is, they will be tied to their wings in the goodness of the goodness to seek the arrest of the wings on the increase of the sacrifice By overcoming the gravity of the land on the movements of the good, and its counterpart is the saying of the high in the mountains and the birds, they praise the living and the hurricane [p.18] The praise is in two days and the tuberculosis.And they were on the right to the condition, and also erected.And a sentence and holds in the position of a staple in the case of its compassion on the description that is the case, so the vision is a guarantee of the meaning of the view, and that is the meaning.And the questioning of the first people seeing an ink, they descended from the house of those who did not see the conditions in the bird because they did not consider it and did not seek it to the meaning of it Divine.And the sentence of what they hold, except the Most Merciful, indicated for the first sentence They see the bird and the consequences in it, that is, their right to know that they are holding them except the mercy, because there is no touched it for it.To fall on the ground [Hajj: 65].And in this gesture that the one who held the goodness of the one who is the one who is the one who has been the one who has been the one who has become the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been the one who has been in the face of the nations, who did not share it, then if they did not share it with it, and if they do not share it with it, and if they do not share it with it, and if they do not share it with it, and if they do not share it with it, and if they do not share it with it To save them from the destruction, as the bird was brought out of the passion.And the meaning of the Lord of God is it: it is preserved from the stallion on the ground with what is called in its creation (P-40) of the characteristics in the lightness of its bones and the power of the movement of the pioneers, and what is the movement of the pad.It is a tenth feather, which is the inauguration of the feathers of the wing, and in Al -Khawafi, and it is what is without it from the wing to the end of its feathers, and the form of its sins, which it created from the form of its bodies, which are appointed to its influence in the air; If all of God created God, it is forbidden for it from the strokes, and that is not with a reason that he suspends with it as one of the people, as it is suspended by some of the rituals of no To view.And the arousal of the name of the Most Merciful here without the name is the knowledge of the disagreement of what is in the surah of the beekeeping, did they not see the goodness of the heavens in the atmosphere of heaven Which we mentioned in their speech by the softening method of his saying, they did not see the birds above them.Among the sentences of their stubbornness, their denials are the name of the Most Merciful, so when they did not take care of what they have to mention and the mercy of the mercy in this surah is four times.And the sentence is that everything is an visible thing that is angry, what they hold, except the Most Merciful The shortcomings of their science or its optimism.And the vision: the knowledge, is derived from insight, for it is other than the description that is from the good names in the grave: the hearing is the vision, but it is here from the door of the saying: With matters.And the Almighty said that God is insightful with worshipers [Ghafir: 44], so it is a news, no description, nor the descent of the name of the name.And it is presented with everything on its attachment to benefit the additional shortcomings, which is the palace of a heart in response Take it with it [King: 13].
