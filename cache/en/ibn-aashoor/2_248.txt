The Shariah researcher, whom they have their prophet, that the verse of his king is that the coffin comes to you in which there is a knife from your Lord and the rest of what the family of Moses has left and the family You were believers.He wanted their prophets to unite them with a miracle indicating that God was a choice to them as a king of king, so he made a verse that indicates that, and that is to come to them.After that in the hands of the two Settisin as it was presented, and this is a sign of the story of God, the Almighty to return the coffin to the children Return the sarcophagus to the children of Israel in a story that was mentioned in the travel of Samuil: he obtained it that the sarcophagus remained seven months in the country, so there are two people in the same way Dagon and the two countries saw verses from the descriptions of their idols on his face, and the broken hands and heads of his hands, and their injury to the pelvis in the most severe, and the most of them.The jars spoil the pants, and when they saw that, they spread the priesthood, and they indicated to them with the delusion of God by returning it to the brokenness of God, and that it is a good.They return it with a guidance: a picture of five in the gold, and the image of five June of gold, on the number of the cities of the Setsin, the great of the Great: And they are, and they came, and they are.The sarcophagus is placed on a new hurry, which is performed by two cows, with a sanding of the golden, golden, and they are called the two cows, to the one who will give it to the people.So they did and the two cows were exempted until the coffin and the sanding reached the hand of the waves in the absence of a sunflower.The sarcophagus to them was before the height of you, and the holy Qur’an violates that, and it can be interpreted as the words of the travel with what is agreed to this that you can carry in this way Remembrance, which is many in their book.And who appears to me (P-493) that the two countries, when they taught the Union of the Israeli under the king of the king who knew that they did not collect their affairs except for the intention of taking from the enemies And the coffin of the covenant is evacuated from their hands, so they managed to show the return of the coffin in the causes of the verses that they witnessed, thinking that the one with the children of the people who said that it is the same The coffin in the male guy is a nose, and this terrifying is not possible before they have been attributed to you, and the appearance of the appearance of the supporters with it.The coffin is an Arab name, and it is weighted, and this is a little weight in the Arab names, so it indicates that what was on his weight, but it is an Arab: Al -Zamakhshari appeared that his weight is a reaction to the sacrifice of the eye for the few names that it is mourning and its blame is a disgraceful person: the same as the authority and the one who is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, Al -Jawhari is in a substance Tob And the coffin in the sense of the updated sanding: It is a manufacturer who is commanded by peace be upon him, with his manufacture.So he made it from the wood of the stomach, which is a tree of the coffin of the core, and made its length of two arm and half, and it was presented as an arm and a half, and it was raised, and it is a chapter, and it is a shame, and it is a shame, and it is a shame, and it is a shame, and it is a shame, and it is a shower, He made him eaten from a gold, and he caused him the fourth of a fool of gold on his fourth strength, and he made him two sticks from the woods of the ribs of the people The sarcophagus, made its cover from gold, and made the way the covering a picture with which two of the angels were imagined by the angels of the gold of their wings, and they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one This coffin is the life of the testimony that God gave them to them, which are the views that God mentioned in his saying, and when you were silent about Moses Al -Gheeb, he took the eyes [154].And the tranquility is active in the sense of the calm and the calm, and in the hadith of the pursuit of prayer, “on you with the knife”, and that is that from the blessing of the coffin that if it is in it, if it is in the time Their souls are pure with the good of the transmitted, and in it is also the books of Moses, peace be upon him, which is what she lives in her vision, the soul of the nation and the reassurance On the first is a metaphor, and on the second one, he was mentioned in the hadith of Asid ibn Hadir Perhaps it is an angel that calls the knife.The rest is in the original: What is preferred from something after the excess of its greatest, and it was clear here by what the family of Moses and the family of Harun left, and it is the remains of the effects Moses his brother (P-494) Haroun, when the priest made him for the sons of Israel, and the preservation of the matters of religion, and the rituals of worshipers were said: And that is a mosaic stick.It is permissible for the rest to be a metaphor for the precious things; Because people are kept, on the banners, and they will remain as the naps said: The rest of the estimation of destiny is enlightened by the family of Al -Jalah as a pride after the pride of this The meaning is the saying of Ruwaishd al -Ta’i: If you are stented, then you will come to me.And close to it the launch of the dedication to the values ​​of the money.What is meant is from the family of Moses and the family of Harun, the people of their house: from the children of Harun; They are the nerve of Moses; Because Moses did not leave children, or what their family has left is their effects, so he turns into the meaning of what Moses and Harun and their family left, or he wanted what Moses and Harun left for the family Say it, enter the family of Pharaoh, the most severe torment [Ghafir: 46].And Harun is the brother of Moses, who is peace be upon them, and he is Harun ibn Amran from Sibat I was born before he commanded Pharaoh to kill the children of the children of Israel, and he is greater than Moses, and when God spoke to Moses with his knowledge, he knows his brother He will be like the Minister for him, and he was revealed to Aaron as well, and Moses was the great messenger, and he was the great life of God to Harun on the tongue of Moses, and he made God to God.When he established the servitude of the servants, and made the priesthood in his lords, so they concluded with judgments that do not share them with the rest of the nation from it Eighth or seven, five, and a thousand years before the Christ, in the mountain of Huro on the grounds of the land that lasts in the period of the rituals in the third year of the elderly.And the saying that the angels carry it as a state of coffin, and the bearing here is the merciful, as in the saying of the Almighty, I said, I do not find what I carry you on it [At -Tawbah: 92] because the rest of it; Therefore, it is called bearing and in the hadith of the conquest of Khaybar: “The red of them was their bears.” The jungle said: (P-495), with which the shepherd of the bearer is a dungeon, so I mean it, so I mean the lame Their way to the permission of God, the two wicked cows with the hurry that the coffin on the locality This is the one who is in the books of the children of Israel.And his saying is that there is a verse for you if you are believers of the signal to all the situation, that is, in the return of the sarcophagus from the hand Peace be upon him, and in his coming from a driver.There is no previous thousand.
