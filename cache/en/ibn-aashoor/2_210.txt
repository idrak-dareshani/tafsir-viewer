The Quranic researcher looks at them unless God brings them in a shadow of dignity and angels, and the matter is spent, and to God, the affairs are returned if the guarantee is running over the one who is the one Readed before it, and it is either the one who admires you, his saying in the worldly life [Al -Baqarah: 204], or to those who share his soul to abuse the pleasure of God [Al -Baqarah: 207] They are waiting for the day of the penalty, for one of the two parties is waiting for a doubt about the return with torment, and the other jurisprudence is waiting for him to wait for the reward for the reward.And his counterpart is his saying, so they wait only for the days of those who were left before them.Say: So wait for me to be from the one who is waiting for them [Yunus: 102] They are waiting for the signs of badness and waiting for the prophet with them waiting for a belief and his feast.And if the guarantee is on the other hand, then it is returned to those who address it by saying, enter into the peace [Al -Baqarah: 208] and what is after him, or to those who have come to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from You are slipped [Al-Baqarah: 209], and it is then the fools from the discourse to the absence, either for the renewal of the activity of the Samaid if it is returned to the addressees with the saying of it (P-282) Believe [Al -Baqarah: 208], or for the increase in the disintegration of the two addressees with his saying, if you are slipped [Al -Baqarah: 209] on the authority of the Edans of Al -Hadir, Al -Qarbi said: Do you think: The income in peace, and the proud of the deceased said to Jews based on the fact that they are intended from his saying, O you who believe, enter the peace [Al -Baqarah: 208] And some of his messengers and his books on one of the advanced faces, and that peace be upon him in Islam, and the joke of tattooing on this saying is.If the guilt is for those who admire you or have it and for those who see himself, then the sentence is a bayyan navigational, because these two cases are the one who is the one who is the one who asks for the good and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who asks for the good.The reward of both of the two parties, so it is his saying, do they see that God brings them as an answer to that, and if the guarantor is returning to those who believe in the one who believes, then they will be Anti -income in Islam in Islam is the fear of the day of the penalty or a greed in its reward, even if the guarantee is for those who have gone out of his saying, then if you have been removed, then you are.A detection of the two sins of a sentence, for God is a dear wise [Al -Anfal: 49] because it is with it, if you are slipped, God does not fulfill you because he is a dear one who is wise, And the angels, and if the destiny is domesticated to the Jews, it is a longing for them for their perseverance about the knowledge of the truth of Islam.And on all the numbers that do not contradict, the arrogance of his saying came, do they look at the guarantee of the gathering a universal system for all the people who are the effects of this The glorious words indicating the knowledge of God Almighty with everything.And the perception of the benefit of the interrogation and the benefit of investigating and it appears that it is a topic for the questioning of something that is intended to verify it, so he said: To ask for a rule that will obtain the knowledge of the accused, and Al -Zamakhshari said in the scouts: The origin of “is it“ that it is an addressed ” It means “that” that is to be investigated, but I have given the benefit of the understanding from the ability Emoking: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Because it does not fall into understanding.It means that the thunderbolt of the understanding is that it is deleted to seek to be dispensed with it with the “right” of the ritual in the questioner, as no one said that one of me is that?” Repeated from the questioning, because it is a resource in the words of the Arabs and the Qur’an is invalidated by that and attributed to that to the zakary and the murmur and the murdered in the saying Then from forever [man: 1], perhaps they wanted to interpret the meaning, do not interpret the Arabs, and we do not know in the words of the Arabs, they are preceded.You can not tell him that he had gathered between my letters, they are on the face of affirmation, as the letters confirm in some words as a saying of the Muslim: ؎ And God does not fulfill what I have for me, nor for what is with them.This is in the interpretation of his saying, “Do you come to the human being when the human being” [Al -Human: 1]) in the Surah of Man.And the questioning is a denominator, not a referral in the way of the discretion.The words are news in the image And the view: the waiting and the anthropology is said to be seen in the sense of its prohibition, because the one who monitors one of his views is directed to the corner of it, so that he will see it, and he will see it.Here we deny the visionary view, that is, they do not look at their eyesight in the hereafter, except that the command of God and the angels, because the occurrence is that the sight looks like that It is not like that, as the intensity of the matter of the command of God, so it will be a propaganda palace, or their eyes are negated from the view other than that.And this compound is not used as it is placed from the denial, but it is used either in the supply and the bond, and it is the apparent apparent on the majority of the face of the one who is in the face of the The destiny was for those who spread itself, or in the blessed destiny, which is the enemy with the appearance of the part of the part, if the guerrilla is back to the two parties, Either the recklessness, if the intended is from the excessive, the existing or the participants, but the Jews, they used to say to my soul, we will not believe that we will not believe.55].It is permissible for this to be a news about the Jews: that is, they do not believe and enter the peace until they see God Almighty in the shadow of the dignity of the one who said: Those who gave the book with every verse that you followed before you [Al -Baqarah: 145].As for the participants, they have told God about them and said that we will not believe for you until you have been broken down from the earth to be alert [Al -Israa: 92], and the saying will come in the event of this extent, and it is with it when the words are on his saying, “Do they look at them except that they come to them from God who come to them The cow.(P-284) and (shadow) with a conquest of the name of a shadow, and the shadow is given to the cane and which summarized me from its truth in the language that it is a name Excellencies in the air, connecting with a horse or focusing on a baptism that is sitting under it to stop the sun of the sun, it is a derivative of the name of the shadow A verb in the sense of an effective or an act of it, such as the nipples, by the sake of the endowment of what is followed by the child, and the sunflow He was divided into his hand [Al -Baqarah: 249]) in the reading of some ten years of guaranteeing the guarantee.It is here, and it is similar to it, similar to it: the great clouds that resemble every clouds, including the shadow of the palace.And from the dignity of the bias of the likeness, and it is the wife of the slogan, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty to them from their surnames from the fire and from under them, the shadow of them [16].And the time is the presence of the self in an other position that preceded it in it, and the adherence to God is transcended in this verse on the face of the evidence, so it is necessary for it to be the same The two was required to be moved or extended to be immediately in the place, after that he was not in it until the two of the two would be correct, and that was the same, and it is necessary for him.The notice of the memorization is appointed to his appearance with the mind of the mind, then if the words were an expert or a disorder, then there is no need for the interpretation, because it is a matter The words are a feast of God, it is necessary to be interpreted, because God is exalted, extinguishing the soul of the matter, but it is not described by what is the characteristics of the animals, such as the transition, and what is not.From the interpretation of this at the origin of Al -Ash'ari in the interpretation of the similar, and this is the interpretation of either in the sense of the two or in its chain of transmission to God or by the one Understanding, and to these tiredness, the faces that are mentioned by the interpreters: the first face of the nation’s predecessor, before Hadith The skepticism of the clouds to the adoption of the similar attributes without the interpretation, so the two are fixed for God Almighty, but how is it like the similar, as it is, and it is not.Like the two of the tilts.As for the way of the successor of the Ash'ari imams to pay the time of the one, then the faces of it come from: And the acquisition, if the blood is returned to those who share itself, abubble the pleasure of God, or that it is a metaphor in the attachment of the fate of the arrogance by the purity of the reward (P-285) (P-285) (P-285) For the two parties, or is a metaphor in the receipt, it is said that the king comes to them if he punished them, the Qurtubi said, I said and that is in every time added to a righteous or enemy, or an enemy, or an enemy, or a matter The seventy in the sense of their people, and the epidemic brought them; Therefore, they say that he came to him in the sense of his family and his origins, so when he was popular, the release of the two came to his necessity, which is the property and the recession, he said: They ceded [Al -Hashr: 2] - and he said - so God came with their sons from the barriers [Al -Nahl: 26] and his saying is in a shadow of clouds with the exiles of this meaning, because the matter Its estimated is a mastermind of that, so that the angels will feel it, and it will come to the shadow of the dignity.The third face: the chain of transmission of God to the Almighty is a metaphor: Rather, the torment of God will come to them on the Day of Resurrection or in the world and his unknown is a shadow The appearance and its fall into the eyes.The loud face: The words of God are grateful to the matter, and that is the word that is listened to by the shadow of the dignity that the angels will be wrapped.Fifth face: that there is an estimated added added to which the command of God will come to them, that is, his judgment between the creation, or the misery of God will come to them with the same way [Al -Nahl: 33] And his saying came to her, with a pain, [Al -A'raf: 4] and it is not hidden that the two years in this thing is that it is a metaphor in the appearance of the matter.The sixth face: the addition of the added of its estimation, the verses of God or its evidence, that is, the evidence of its estimation, or the evidence of its messengers, and its sake of the words of it Refer to the fifth direction or to the third direction.The seven face: that there is a work that is deleted, and his saying, so know that God is dear wise [Al -Baqarah: 209] and the estimation: that God comes to God With his goodness.And the best: the estimation of a general matter that includes good and evil to be the sentence, promise and return.And I mentioned the interpretation of his words from it, the verses of the arbitrators are the mother of the book, and the last one is similar [Al -Imran: 7] in Surah Al -Amran, what is made of it that he is not.Among the attributes and rulings and the actions that are supported by the book And the Sunnah is four sections: a section that God has described it on the truth, such as the presence and life, but what violates the compatibility in us, and the division of God is the same Until (P-286), who is replaced in the appropriate meaning without the obligatory, is the same as mercy, anger, contentment, and love, and the division is similar and its appearance, The severity.And the words of the exalted in the shadow of the dignity are more severe than the chain of transmission to God, the Almighty, for his grade, and it is a premium on God Almighty, and that is the one who is in the) (He brings them a shadow from the dignity) and it is a shadow that carries the torment from the thunderbolts or the disorganized wind or the like of that if the torment is a world, or in the shadow of the shadow of The command of God is the Almighty or his torment, even if they see a fracture of the sky, fall A torment, or on his words, or the pilgrim, for lights that God makes a mark for people on the Day of Resurrection on the start of the semester of the account.Al -Wajdani, and in the interpretation of the penitent and the pride was said: In the verse, it is old and late, and the origin of the words: that God comes to them and the angels in the shadow of the shadow of the To come to the angels, and it was narrated that the son of Masoud has read it like that, and this is all the faces of which is based on that this is a brother of the matter They look at the farmer of the two parties or the Jews that the words are accused, that is, what they are waiting for in the way of entering into the entry of Islam, God brings them in the conditions that they are accustomed to, and he will speak to them to enter the debt, so they said to Moussa: We will not believe in you until we see God in the cow: 55] It is intended to be inflicted on the participants, and some interpretations were presented with the interpretation of the two.The gamborn and the angels read it by raising the elevation of the name of the Majestic, and the chain of transmission to the angels because they are the ones who come to the command of God or the torment of God It is dedicated to his judgment, for the chain of transmission to them is a fact, so if the chain of transmission to God is the highly used in a metaphor, then it is a usual, then it is a usual.It is a realistic meaning, so it is from the use of the memorial in its right and its metaphor, and if the chain of transmission of the two to God is glorified in the chain of transmission, then its chain of transmission to the angels is in the way Support and there is no prohibition from that; Because the chain of transmission is a phrase of the intended of the speaker with the Qur’an, Hamid ibn Thawar praises the servant of the king: God has come to me, and God bless you guide So he supported him to God, which is a true chain of transmission, and then he supported him with kindness to the light and peace, and the chain of transmission (P-287), who comes to them for them, for the sake of them: He said (upon you is an indication).And Abu Jaafar (and the angels) read a mortality (the angel) is a compassion (shadow).He said it and the matter is either compared to a sentence.Alert it to the investigation of its fall, or the approach of its fall, and the meaning is what they wait except that God will bring them and the fulfillment of the matter, or the kindness of God Or, and the verb, as well as for the future, and the meaning is what they monitor except for the coming of the command of God and the matter.Either a current sentence and the past on its origin and the “may”, whether the sentence was they looking at the news or a promise and a return; That is, then, the matter has been spent, or he alerted him that if they are waiting for the truth of Muhammad that God will come to them and the angels, then if this is the same The right to them has the right to perish as his saying, and they said if there is no king on him, and if we would have revealed a king, he would have spent the matter, then they will not look [Al -Anam: 8].And the judiciary: emptiness and completeness.And the definition of the matter is either for the Persians, which is intended to be overwhelmed by that, that is, all things are all things, or for the covenant, that is, the matter of these punishment, or the matter of the matter.And he said to him, and to God, things return to a gathering universal: and the matter was spent.And the return in the original: the mold to the position that the return came out of, and the metaphor is used in the end of the thing and its ending and the appearance of its effect, so it is from it, so it is not to God.And the act of “returned” comes in transcendence: I say that I return more to his country and his export of return, and he uses a return of a minor to say: He said: Return, Nafaa, Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr, Asim, and Abu Jaafar, and Jacob (return), by adding the Tax, and opening the gym on that it is a harbinger of it.Building the acting, that is, the affairs return to God, and the perpetrator is deleted for this because of the help of a well -known act From the contradiction between the name of the majesty, it is effective for the rejuvenation and the act of it with a rivalry to it, and the rest of the ten read it by building the reaction of the one who returned the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who returned the one who is the one who returned to the one who returned the one who is the one who returned to the one “Return”.
