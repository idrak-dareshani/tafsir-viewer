The Quranic researcher is the third of the righteous, the Almighty said: They feed the food on his love for holders, orphans, and a captive.Thank you, we are afraid of our Lord, on the day of a ritual ritual.Narrated.(P-216) and the companionship of the creation of God, and the signal is by saying: They feed the food.Here are the questions: the first question: No one of the proud of the disgraced, like my father, is the deafness of the deaf and my father Ali al -Jabai and my father al -Qasim al -Kaabi, and my father Abd al -Jabar ibn Ahmad in their interpretation that these verses were descended in the right of Ali ibn Abi, who is upon him, peace be upon him.In the right of peace be upon him, and the companion of the “scout” from the disgraced, he mentioned this story, so he narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them: “ A pleasure, so they will return the Messenger of God ﷺ in people with him, so they said: O Abu Al -Hassan, if you were vowed to your son, then he will be warned against me and Fatimah, and a hypocris Fasting three days, healing, and something with them, so it is lended to me from the Shamoun Al -Khaybari, the Jewish, three of the rituals of the righteous.Tablets on their number, and put them among them to break them, and they stopped them, and he said: Peace be upon you The Muslims, they feed me, may God bless you with the benefits of Heaven, so they influenced him and have become and they did not taste except water and become fasting, so when the mother of you He will be ahead of them, and they will be affected, and they influenced him, and they came to them as a prisoner in the third, so they did like that, and when they became, they took upon him, and the peace be upon him, and the peace be upon him.On the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, when they see them as they lived like the hunger of hunger, he said: What is the most bad thing that I see with you.The adhesion of its stomach with its appearance and its eyes was ran out, so it was the same, so Jabril, peace be upon him, sent it and said: Take it, Muhammad, here is God.And the first they say: It is the highest mentioned in the first surah that it created the creation of the ritual and the two of the two, then he showed that it is the guidance of the whole, and it was removed from them Thank you and to a disbeliever, then he mentioned and the holiday of the infidel, and then followed him with remembrance and the promise of the complainant, so he said: The righteous drink [Man: 5], and this is the form of a group.Thank you and the Abrar, and such as this cannot be specialized in one person; Because the fence of the surah is from the first to this The position requires that this be a bias for the state of everyone who was the righteous and the obedient, and if we had made it a single person with one of the spoils of the wig.The second: that those who seemed to those who seek these attributes are mentioned in the form of collection; As his saying: The righteous are drinking, and they will die with warning, fear, and feed, and so on to the last verses, so you specialize in a group, and they are not disgraced The entry of Ali ibn Abi, who is upon him, peace be upon him, but he is also inside all the verses indicating the explanation of the conditions of those who are obedient.The companions and the followers are inside it, then it does not remain for specialization in the sense of the heart, O God, except that it is said: The surah has come down with the ritual of the breasts of the breasts of the breasts of the breasts of the breasts of the breasts of the breasts of the breasts of his heart, But it has been established in the origins of jurisprudence that the lesson is in the general public, not with the privacy of the cause.The second question: Those who say: This verse is specialized by Ali ibn Abi, who is upon him, peace be upon him, who said: What is meant by his saying: and they are fed up with food Crab, orphans and captives is what we have narrated that peace be upon him, feed the poor, the orphan and the captive, and those who say: the verse is general in the right of all the righteous.Feeding food is a fantasy from charity to the needy and sympathy with them with any face, and if this was not with food with his eyes, and the face of the kindness that is the good of the kind of goodness; And that is because the sins of the eternity with food, and there is no life except with it, and it may be deluded with the possibility of life with what it has done, so when the charity is not a crime, it crossed it, It is strengthened that it is expressed by eating (P-217), all the faces of the benefits, and it is said: So that so, so that his money was cured if he wrapped it in the path of the face of the difference, and he said: The money is unjust, but they eat in their stomachs with fire [Women: 10], and he said: Do not eat your money among you with falsehood [Al -Baqarah: 188] If you prove this, then say: Because they are in their money, the people of weakness and need, and the words of the Almighty: on his love, then he will be in his love: To him, and his counterpart and money came to his love [Al -Baqarah: 177], you will not get righteous until you spend what you love [Al -Imran: 92].The second: Al -Fadil ibn Ayad said: On the love of God, that is, their love for God; And the blame may be held in the place of “Ali”, and it is also held at the place of the mother.Then it is the highest of the categories of those who give their sympathy, and they are three: one of them: the poor, and he is unable to receive themselves.The second: the yatim, which is the one who died of his captivity, so he remains excited about the gain for his younger, with his captivity.The third: the captive, which is taken from his people, is murdered [the [] I was neglected, which is not He possesses his own victory or a trick, and these are those who mentioned God Almighty, here they are those who mentioned them in his saying: So do not preach the obstacle Surrounding or feeding on a day with a desirable one or -knife with a stirred one [Al -Balad: 16], and we have mentioned the disturbance of the people in the poor before this It is in it on the words: One of them: Ibn Abbas, Al -Hassan and Qatada said: It is the prisoner of the participants, it was narrated that he was praying and peace be upon him.With their right; That is because it is obligatory to eat them until the imam sees his opinion of them from killing, from a redemption or a sterilization, and it is not forbidden for them to be the intention of the prisoner; An infidel or Muslim; Because if he is with the infidels, it is obligatory to feed it, then the Islam is taken over, then it was said: When he must kill him, how should he eat it?We said: The killing is in a state that is not forbidden from food in another case, and it is not obligatory if he is punished with his face to be punished with another journey It is without killing.Then this food is on whom?We say: The imam feeds it, so if the imam does not do it, the Muslims are obligatory.And the second: Al -Saddi said: The captive is the mortal.And the third of it: The prisoner is the sunset, peace be upon him said: “Your jealous is your captive, so good to your captive.” And the one who is the one: the captive is the prisoner from the people of the kiss, and it is a saying of a junction, a gift, and Said bin Jabir.Fakar, orphan, I have no father, and a prisoner who said: The mortar is imprisoned." Fifth: The prisoner is the wife; Because they are the prosecutions of the curtains, peace and blessings be upon him said: “Fear God in the women, for they have aid.Because the origin in the family is the tension in the tie, and the captive was doing it with a love for him, then he was called the prisoner who tightened and who did not tighten, so the meaning returned.And know that he was upset when he mentioned that the righteous are good to these arguments, indicating that they have two widespreads: one of them: the sake of the consent of God, and he is the one who says: We feed you for the face of God.And the second: The bound is from the fear of the Day of Resurrection, and it is what is meant by his saying: We are afraid of our Lord on the day of a ritual in the day, and we are the questions: the first question: God guided him to his saying: a rain that leads three face The saying is to prevent those who need to be rewarded with the same or by thank you; Because their benevolence is an effective for the sake of God Almighty, there is no meaning for the reward of creation, or that it is (P-218) for the sake of that saying that the saying becomes He agreed and alerted him to what he is to be for him to be a loyal to God until they are not others in that way.And the second: to be they wanted to be that.And the third of it: that this is a man and a revelation of their beliefs and the authenticity of their intention, even if they did not say anything.And on the authority of Mujahid: that they did not speak to him, but God's knowledge of them is upon them, so he praised them.The second question: Know that charity is a way that will be for the sake of God Almighty, and a time will be for the other hand.Either asking for a reward or a request for Hamid and a blessing, and a time that will be for them, and this is the polytheism, and the first is the acceptance of God Almighty, and the remaining sedan said: You are invalidated by your charity with whom and harm is like the one who spends the money of the people.The face of God [Al -Rum: 39] and there is no doubt that the symmetry is the pleasure of the gender and harm.If you know this, then we say: The people when they said: We feed you for the sake of God, in which it is in it, in which it is in the way that he feed him for the sake of God, for the sake of God, for the sake He denied this involvement by saying: We do not want a penalty or a thank you.The third question: Thank you and infidels as a source of thanksgiving and infidels, and it is on the weight of entry and al -Kharj.Thank you for the gang of thanks and made the infidels the group of infidels; For his saying: The unjust people are only infidels [Al -Israa: 99] like a cold and cold, and if you want one source in the sense of gathering, like a bit.The following question: Its saying: We are afraid of our Lord, and they are bound by one of them: one of them: our kindness to you for fear is from the intensity of that day, not for the will.The second: We do not want the reward from you to fear the punishment of God for the reward for the reward for the charity, for it was said: He is the Almighty, and he told them to be given, and the best of them, The resurrection is only, and when the food was narrated from them, this is with two things: asking for the satisfaction of God, and with fear for the resurrection, what is the reason for it?We said: The fulfillment of the warning entered into the right to seek the satisfaction of God Almighty; And that is because the vow is the one who was answered by the same person for the sake of God, so when he was like that, there is no crime that he guided to the fear of the resurrection, so that it is only.The truth of the request of God's consent, so there is no crime that he was asking for him to seek the consent of God and ask for warnings of the fear of resurrection.The fifth question: The day was described as the garbage, with two ways: one of them: to be described as a family of his people from the hardships, as you say: The infidel is loved until it becomes a sweaty, like the diameter.The second: to liken it in its severity And his hurry with the lion of the worshiper or the brave brave.The sixth question: Al -Zajaj said: It came in the interpretation that a domain is that the face of the face is packed, so what is between the eyes is gathered between the two eyes, and he said: This is a lord, and this is a way.The camel, if it raises its sins and gathered its two sins and threw its nose, means that the meaning of the rhetoric in the language was collected, and the dog said: a veil, and it is a ritual, and it is a heart, and it is a heart that means Ubaidah and the mighty and the son of Qatibah, they said: The day of Qamirir and Qadir; If it is a severe difficulty, the most severe of the days and its prolonged in the calamity, the one said: This is a meaning, and the interpretation is the first.
