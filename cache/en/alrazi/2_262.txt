The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: Those who spend their money in the path of God, then they will not follow what they have spent from them, nor have their reward for them with their Lord, nor their goodness.Know that he is up to the great spending of spending in the path of God, followed him with the two things that the things that must be obtained until that reward remains, from which the reward is left.Then in the verse: The first question: The verse was revealed in Uthaman and Abd al -Rahman ibn Awf.With her subscription and a thousand dinars, the Messenger of God raised ﷺ his hands, saying: “O Lord, Othman, I was satisfied with him, and he was satisfied with him.” As for Abd al -Rahman ibn Afaf, it is true of the half of his money for four thousand dinars, so the verse was revealed.The second question: Some of the interpreters said: The advanced verse is specialized in whom he agreed upon himself Spending others, but the great reward is required to be mentioned in the verse if it is not followed by one or harm.Al -Qaflal - may God have mercy on him - said: It is possible that this condition is also considered, as well With the Messenger of God ﷺ and the Muslims abolishing the pleasure of God Almighty, and does not believe in it (P-41) the Prophet ﷺ and the believers, and no one is harmful to the believers I did not bring what this matter was done, and he says to others: I am weak, with a lot of you in jihad.The third question: “Mina” in the language on its faces: one of them: in the sense of the public, it is said: Whoever God has been on so, if it is blessed, or for the sake of the son of the son ؎ So we are upon us in peace, for it is your words, my sapphire and a circle of systems, and it is his saying ﷺ: He wants more in his mind, and also God is the highness that describes it as a tender, meaning: a blessing.And the second face in the interpretation: “Mina” is the deficiency of the truth and the underestimation of it.The death is called a minor because it decreases the life, and the excuses are cut.And from this chapter, the defamatory; Because it decreases the grace, and its empowered, and the Arabs are praised by the blessing of the people with the blessing, he said to them: ؎ increased your knowledge of me with my greatness, that it is a greatness.؎ He forgot him as if he did not come to him ∗∗∗ and he is in the world a lot of great.The one was defamful for its wings: The first: that the poor is taken for the charity, breaking the heart for the sake of its need to the charity, other than the one who is not aware of it, If the one who gave to that added to that yearning for that year, that increases that in his heart, so that he will be in the wisest of the harmful after the benefit, and in the ruling of the one who is the one who is the one.The second: The purification of the one who excludes the people of the need from the desire in his sincerity if he is defeated by his way.The third: that the one who is given must be believed that this blessing is from God Almighty, and that he believes that God has a great blessing, and he is a great blessing He has a couple with this year what he brings out of the acceptance of God, and when the matter was like that, he prohibited him to make him a blessing.The four: It is the original secret that if he knows that that giving is easy, because God Almighty has given him the causes of giving and removed the causes of the prevention, and when the matter was like that, the matter was like that.There is no servant, for the servant, if this is in this degree, is his heart, enlightened by the light of God Almighty, and if he was not like that, but he was busy with the reasons of the gossip, and the reasons were On the reading of the Rabwani Rabian causes, so it was in the grace of the Bahaim who do not sophisticated their views from the mind to the mind and the effects of the influence.As for the harm, they have disappeared in it, some of them who carried it on release in the harm of the believers, and that is not that of those who are, but it is obligatory to be in particular, and it is not the same For the poor: You are ever coming to the pain and God blessed me from you and the distance of what is between me and between you, so he explained his grace and the Almighty that he who has spent his money and does not spend his money and does not The great and the rewarding reward.If it was said: the appearance of the preservation is that they are all, they want the reward, so it is obligatory that if one of them was found without the second, the reward is not overwhelmed.(P-42) We said: Rather, the condition is that there is no one of them; Because he said: They are not followed by what they have agreed with no, nor harm, it is necessary that neither this nor that or that fall from it.The following question: The disgrace said: The verse indicates that the cabares are the reward of its actor, and that is because it is the Almighty that this reward is that it is not possible.Because if you have proven with them and with them, they did not have this extension.Our companions answered that what is meant by the verse is that the fact that the inclusion and harm will be removed from spending that there is a reward and principle in it, from where they are indicated that it is not watered, but he woke To demand the pleasure of God, and on the face of kinship and worship, then the reward of the reward is not criminalized.The judge stabbed this answer and said: It is the Almighty to show that this spending has been correct, and for that he said: They are not followed by what they have spent and the word “then” for the cries, Displaced for reward; Because the struggle of the affected must be the case The influencer, not after.Our companions answered from his faces: The first: that the remembrance of Germany and harm, even if it is delayed from spending, except that this delayed remembrance indicates that it is a matter For the sake of God, but for the sake of raising the people and asking for lime and hearing, and when the matter was like that, his spending was not necessary for the reward.And the second: He endowed that this condition is delayed, but it was not permissible to say: The effect of the influence is stood up to what is after what he is in the way of what is necessary Mawafi, and its report is known in the science of speech.The fifth question: The verse indicates that the sin and the harm are from the cabares, where this great obedience comes out as one of them is that the reward is beneficial.As for his saying: They have their rewards, and it is in it: The reward is due to the promise, not by the same work; Because work is obligatory for the servant, and the performance of the duty is not obligatory.The second question: our companions took this verse on the negation of frustration, and that is because it indicates that the reward is to have a launch, so it is necessary for you The verb of the cabaret, and that is the saying of frustration.The third question: The nation has gathered on his saying: They have their reward for their Lord, and they are not intended that the disbelief is not found, and that is the same For private will, and when it is permissible for that in the sentence, the connotation of the general memorization is not a result of the severity In general, the pieces are on the feet.As for his saying: There is no fear for them, nor are they grieved in his saying: The first: that their spending in the path of God is not lost, but his reward is available to them.That there is no existence, and they are not saddened by the reason that it is not found, and it is like the Almighty saying: And whoever works from the righteous and is a believer, then he does not fear injustice or digestion [Taha: 112].The second: that the (P-43) is intended to be the day of the resurrection, they do not fear the torment of the bit, as he said: They are from the fear of the day they believed.[The Prophet: 103].
