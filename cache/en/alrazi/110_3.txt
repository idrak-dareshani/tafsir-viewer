The Quranic researcher (P-146) said: He praised the praise of your Lord and forgiven him, that he was a repentant in which he had books: The first question is that he was upset with his command With forgiveness, and for this repentance is a good: the first is the first: I know that the last of victory is Sunnah with the fact that Muhammad was on the right of what is done by the heart of the heart If I am on the right, why don't you help me?And why did these disbelieves be overwhelmed with me?For the sake of apologizing for this kidnapper, he is commanded to praise, but for our saying: What is meant by this eagerness is that you are out of what you deserve to be It does it, but it does it with the judgment of the divine will, so that you do what you are so as to do as you follow the vagina Something, and on the saying of the disgrace: What is the most promotion is that the servant knows that that delay was in the cause The truth, then if the servant empties from God that he does not want, then he will be used to praise his praise for what was given from charity and righteousness, then then he will be done.For his souls.The second face: that the two of the two ways are two ways, so whoever said: I have not seen anything except and I saw God after him, and among them who said: I have not seen anything but I have seen, and I have seen anything Complete, as for the ruler of the ruler, because the descent is from the influencer to the effect, a period of time from the archeology to the influence, and with the effects The light is the duty of existence, and the injustice is the ability to exist.The reciprocate of follow -up to the original, and if this is proven, then we say: the verse is indicative of this way that is the honor of the two ways, and that is because it is the same Exercise with the soul, so he reminded first of the Creator two things: one of them: praise.The second: Tahdid, then they mentioned in the third, exploitative arrogance, which is a condition mixed from the fools to the Creator and to the creation.And know that the attributes of the truth are counted in the robbery, the positive, the negation, and the confirmation, and the afflictions are presented on the positives, so praise is a sign of exposure to the lines of the peace Witness, which is the characteristics of the majesty, and the timing is a sign of the confidential attributes of it, and it is the characteristics of the honor, and for that, the Qur’an indicates that the majesty is presented to the majesty, and the majesty is on the authority of the majesty.The two types of exploitation with a definition, and the provision is required from it to seek forgiveness; Because the seeker has the vision of the shortcomings The righteous and the most common of the soul, and it is known that the best of the servant is a prayer other than God.Forgiveness of praise and timing.The third direction: It is a guidance for good news to the analogy of the king The humanity is the first of the angels, then the angels mentioned in themselves, and we praise your praise and sanctify you [Al -Baqarah: 30] So say: Your Lord is a sign of analogy with the angels in their saying: We praise your praise [Al -Baqarah: 30] and say it here: (And seek forgiveness) to his words: Because they were pleased with his saying: We sanctify you, that is, we make yourself sanctifying for your satisfaction, and the forgiveness is returned with its meaning, as well.What is meant is that they claimed to themselves that they praised my praise and saw that from themselves Your soul, but you must see it from my success and my goodness, and it is necessary to say: the angels as they said in the right God in their right: and seek forgiveness for those who believed in And they say: Our Lord, forgive those who repent and follow your path [Ghafir: 7].The loud face: the praise is the purification, so it is necessary for the intended to purify the kaaba from the idols and break it, then he said: “I praise your Lord That is the purification of the mediation of the exploitation of the praise of your Lord, and his help and his strength, then if you do that, then you will not be seen, you will see the soul of your soul.You must see your soul in this state short, so ask for forgiveness from your shortcomings in his obedience.And the fifth face: as if it is the Almighty saying: O Muhammad, either you are infallible or if you are not informed, then if you are infallible, then he will be able to do so You are informed, and he used to seek forgiveness, so the verse will be like an alert that there is no void of the expression in the servants as he said: and the servant of your Lord.Al -Yakin [Al -Hijr: 99].* * * He praised that the swimmer praises in the water like the function in the air and its soul is plunged from being in it in it, or it is infected with the seat of the water and its mourning, Because you praise him, that is Him in the etiquette of God, with whom it is not permissible from the characteristics of the self and the verb, in exile and in accordance with the fact that the king The bit is overwhelmed, as the memorial benefits the items in the self, the characteristics and the acts.And the second saying: that what is meant by praise is prayer; Because this is the memorial and a response in the Qur’an in the sense of prayer, he said: “Glory be to God, when you touch, and when you become,” [Al -Rum: 17] and he said: And he praised the Lord of God.130] The one who asserts that this surah is one of the last of what he descended, and peace be upon him in the last of his illness, he says: Prayer and what I have in your mind made it With it for his tongue, "Then some of them said: He meant the prayer of the thank you, the day of the conquest of the eight rak'ahs, and others said: It is the prayer of the sacrifice, and he said: And the four of the sacrifices, and the name of the prayer by praise, as it is not dismantled about it, in which it is alert The first saying of the many mentioned in this, Aisha narrated, “The Messenger of God ﷺ was after the descent of this surah, it is more And with your praise, I ask forgiveness and repent to you.At the end of his matter, he does not rise, does not fall, does not go, and does not come unless he said: Glory be to God and praise Him, so I said: O Messenger of God, you are more than God: He said: I was commanded by it, and read: If the victory of God comes." And on the authority of Ibn Masoud: “When this surah came down, peace be upon him, he would say: Glory be to God, and God bless you.” It was narrated that he said: "I seek forgiveness from God every day a hundred times." * * * The third question: the verse indicates the grace of praise and the praise, where it is made enough in the performance of what is required of the grace of victory, and the noble And his saying: The fast for me is one of the greatest virtues of fasting, so he added it to itself, then he made the path of the prayer equal to the fasting in this mushroom: and that the mosque is: [18] It is indicated that the prayer is better than the fast in a lot, and then the prayer is a shelter for the remembrance, and for that he said: And the remembrance of God is the greatest [the spider: 45] and how is it not like that His praise is a knowledgeable and a sacrifice.It was said: The number of propaganda is required that it is the least dedicated than the brochure of the works Prayer, we said: The answer to it is from his faces: one of them: that the path of the actions of the prayer is what the heart does not tend to it, so it will be in it to the positive, but the praise and the reason for it is the reason A lover upon him, and he was satisfied with the medical love, and for that he said: And those who believe in the most severe love [Al -Baqarah: 165].And the second: that his saying: (Praise) is an order and the matter of the divorced woman with jurisprudence, and whoever says: The divorced matter for the delegate said: He is for us.He has forgiven the exploitation, and the expression is obligatory, and the right to the consequences of the conversation between the kind and the consequences of it.And the third of it: that if it was obligatory, the punishment that has been blessed is the greatest of the most visible to the increase of its greatest, so it left the positive fear of this warning.* * * The following question: As for the praise, its interpretation is presented, and the interpretation of his saying: He praised the praise of your Lord, so remember it: The scouts, that is, say: Glory be to God and praise be to God, like what I see from the wondrous of his wonders, that is, the whole of them saying: I drink with the water.And secondly: If you regenerate God, then you will praise Him; Because praise is within the praise; Because the praise is upon him and the thanks to him, it is imperative that it be hidden from the purity; Because he is not afflicted with the best, unless it is out of the shortage, and for that he made the key to the Qur’an with praise to God and when he said: His servant, and his words did not open with praise, and he said: He praised the praise of your Lord with his praise, praising him by the way to praise him.And the third of it: to be immediately, and its meaning is praiseworthy as your saying: Request with your weapons, that is, armed.And its booster: It is permissible for it to be a praise that you are able to regenerate after the praise, as if he says: The collection does not come to you, as well Prayer intends to be able to fly after it, so that the wounds gather for you in that hour like that.Fifth: That this is the case that is in your saying: I did this with the grace of God, that is, he praised him with praise of God and His guidance, and he is not, and he is not.The dismantling is the saying of Aisha: “With the praise of God, not with your praise.” “Praise be to God, praise be to God.” And its sixth: Al -Saddy narrated: praise your Lord, that is, with the command of your Lord.And its sake: that the Ba is an increased link, and the ability is: praise the praise of your Lord, then there are prevailing: one of them: he chose to purify him.And the second: the purification of the Muhammad’s rescue from the listening and the hearing, and the consequences of its remembrance to the corrupt worldly purposes.And the third: purifying the praise of your Lord from that She says: I came with it as it is worthy of it, and the signal is by saying: And what God has appreciated the right of His destiny [Al -Anam: 91].And the eighth: that is, it comes to praise, instead of the praise that is obligatory for you, and that is because the praise is only in the interview of blessings, and the blessings of God is upon us The expansion of the humanity, and for that he said: And if you prepare the grace of God, do not count it [Ibrahim: 34] So that he is the Almighty saying: You are unable to do the praise, so you will come.And the ninth: It contains a sign that the praise and praise are not permissible for one of them to be the second of them, and it is also not imagined that he will be brought together with them, so that he will be brought together, so that he will be with them, so that he will be with them.The lips and the right of the response with the disadvantage, it must be said: I chose the lips in my own, that is the salesman, as well as he said: He praised the praise of your Lord to fall with a slope, and he will fall together.And I see it: that the intention is to praise your heart, that is, the purification of your heart with the mediation of the praise of the praise of your Lord, then if you see that everyone is from God, then you have been purified from God.Your soul and your effort, so he said: (Praise) is a sign of the negation of what God Almighty has, and his saying: praise your Lord, a sign (P-149) to the vision of all things.* * * Fifth question: In his saying: (And seek forgiveness) and faces: One of them: Perhaps he was peace be upon him, he was hoping that he will be upset, He heard: If the victory of God comes, he will be preoccupied, but if he had been in this evil, it is a condition that he does not take revenge, so that the evil will be discarded, so the evil is, so the evil is, so the evil is, so it is not.They enter the religion of God and command him to ask forgiveness for the two of the two, but it is known that the expiation for those who have no sin is not good, so he does not know.Hope to delegate it to pardon and leave the straightening; Because what he commanded is to ask them for forgiveness, so how is it good for him to be able to do with a risk of them?Then he concluded with the memorial of repentance, as if he said: The acceptance of the repentance is his letters, so everyone who asked him to repent is given, as the abundance is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the end He has anything from that of that of that enjoyment, he sold it from him, whether the cheerful was enemy or a guardian, so the Lord, the Lord, is accepted by the repentance, or the righteousness of the repentance, whether it was Civil, then peace be upon him, the Lord of the Lord, the Exalted, and they said to him: A generous brother and the son of a generous brother who said to them: Do not be pleased with you.I commanded me to ask forgiveness for you, so it is not permissible for me to return me.And the third of it: that his saying: (and seek forgiveness) either that the intention is and seeking forgiveness from God for your soul or for your nation, if the one who wants to be the first is the one who is the first It is a disobedience or not?Whoever said: The disobedience was issued About him mentioned in the extension of the exploitation of its faces: one of them: that it is not forbidden to be the lot of exploitation from it, it affects the sins of his sins.And the second: His expulsion is obligated to save the guilt and the third: to seek forgiveness to become the forgiveness of the forgiveness of the people of the deceased Something originally, but whoever said: The disobedience was issued for him, so he mentioned in this expression of the forgiveness of his face Forgiveness.And the second: God worshiped him with that to be paid by him otherwise, as every cost is not safe from a shortcomings that he falls from him in his worship And his deafness did not seek refrain from seeking forgiveness, so how do you without him?.And the third of it: that the expiation was the one who left the best.And he paid it: that the exploitation was that every obedience brought by the servant, so if he met it with the charity of the Lord and found it, he is minor from the one who is the righteousness For that time.Fifth: Soding the causes of shortening in Silkuk; Because the walk to God, if he arrives in a place in the servants, then he will be overlooked, then after he visited him, he sees that shrine in a minor, so he will seek forgiveness from God, and he will forgive him The path to God is not an urban, and there was no crime.As for the second, it is that it is what is meant and forgiven it for the guilt of your nation, it is also an apparent; Because he was upset with the forgiveness of the guilt of his nation in his saying: And ask forgiveness for your guilt and the believers and the believers [Muhammad: 19] I ask forgiveness is obligatory and important, and so if we say: What is meant is that we seek forgiveness for itself and his nation.* * * The sixth question: in the verse is a form, which is that the repentance is presented to all obedience, then praise is presented to praise; Because praise be in the cause of public, and the public is as it is issued from the shrine, so he will be released from others, so he would have come to fall into the absence He remembers the praise, and then reminds praise, so what is the reason for becoming a reminder of the opposite of this syntax?And his answer: From his faces: The first: Perhaps he started with honor, for the honorable people came down to the brother, and the most miserly, alert him to the descent from the Creator to the Creator.And the second: in which he alerts him that praise and praise be narrated from the servant, if he becomes an interview with the glory of God and his pride, he became the eyes of the sin, so he must be forgiven.And the third: praise and praise is a sign of the glorification of the command of God, and the forgiveness of reference to the companionship of the creation (P-150) [God], and the first is like the prayer, and the prayer is like the prayer It is presented to zakat, so we are here.The following question: The verse indicates that he is praying and peace be upon him.Decree to inform the surah to the whole nation until the transmission of the Qur’an is frequent, and until we know that it is good to do the way to the way of the one who is the one who is the same By praising and seeking forgiveness on the face of the purification, to get this exhibition.And the second: It is from the total of the purposes that the messenger becomes a luminous for the nation until they do with the grace and the insult that the Messenger did from the one Renew the grace.And the third of it: that the most trivial in the witness is to bring praise in the beginning of the matter, so God commanded His Messenger with praise and forgiveness always, and in all of the time and time to the time Other than him, then he said: And seek forgiveness when he was sought by his soul to him to do the nation when they were tracked as such.* * * The eighth question: In the verse, one of them is: It is that he said: It was a repentant over the past and we needed our acceptance in the future.And the second: Did he say: Forgiveness as he said: In Surah Noah?And the third of it: He said: The victory of God and said: In the debt of God, then he did not say: God bless God, but he said: With the praise of your Lord?And the answer to the first of his faces: one of them: that this is the most beautiful as if he said: I did not give you the same I kissed their kindness, as they are, after the appearance of the great miracles, and the siphon, and the emancipation of the mountain, and the descent of the one and the peace be upon them.And when they repented, I accepted their repentance, so if I met the repentance of those without you, do I not accept it from you?And the second: Since a lot, I have been approved in the acceptance of the dirt of disobedience and the honesty is obligatory on the acceptance of the enemy, so how is the generosity of the Most Merciful?.And the third of it: I was a repentant before I commanded you to seek forgiveness.And its elevation: as if it is a sign of the alleviation of their crime, that is, you are not the first of those who reap and repent, but it is my forestry, and the crime is a calamity for the adrenal and the calamity if it is a matter.Fifth: As if it is a counterpart of what is said: God has done good, as it has passed, as well honor; Because it is not said in the attributes of the servant, and it is said: A repentant if it is coming with the repentance, then he says to the Almighty: You were to me from the first thing, you are a believer, and I am a believer So you will become a name for me the last thing, for you are a repentant, and I am a repentant, then the repentance is in the right of God, that it is the Almighty to accept the repentance, so it is a lot of repentance The servant is that It will be a lot of repentance.And the second: It was said: a repentant because the saying may say: I ask forgiveness from God and not with repentance, and from him he said: His Lord, “If it is said: He may say: I repent, and it is not permissible.Because the repentance is a name for the pleasure and the delegation, by the disagreement of the exploitation, it is not a liar in it, so the appreciation of the words, and the forgiveness of it, be forgiven, and the forgiveness of it, The conclusions of the work must be of repentance and expression, as well as the conclusions of the work, and it was narrated that he did not sit with a jam except for the seal of the question The third: that he took the sponsor of the justice, so he mentioned the name of the self, two times, and the name of the verb was mentioned two times; One of them is the Lord, and the second is repentant, and when the rabies are first and the last of the tweak, the name of the Lord was mentioned first and the name of the repentance.* * * (P-151) ﷺ: What makes you cry?A lot of knowledge." It was narrated that Omar was glorifying the son of Abbas and approaching him and giving permission to him with the people of Badr, so Abd al -Rahman said: Do you give permission to this boy, and in our heart?And he said: Because whoever you have learned, Ibn Abbas said: So he gave birth to them on the day and permission to me with them, so he asked them about the saying of God: If he comes to God, he will not ask God Some of them: God commanded his Prophet if he opened to seek forgiveness and repent to him, so I said: It is not like that, but I was given to him, and he said: You know, then he said: How do you blame me after what you saw?It was narrated that when this surah was written and said: “A servant was good for him between the world and between his meeting and the hereafter, so he triumphed for the sake of God.” This surah is on this meaning?The answer: From the faces: one of them: some of them said: They knew that when we narrated that the Messenger had written the Aqeeb of the Surah and mentioned the seduction.And the second: that when he mentioned the victory and conquest, and the entry of people in religion, there are signs that indicate that the cruise and perfection are made, and that is the imams of the disappearance as it is.We missed it, so it is said that it is said that it is said that it is a matter of praise, praise, and expulsion, and it is divorced, and it is absent from it.Like an alert that the matter of Tablig has dominated and has been completely, and that requires death; Because if he remained after that Like the isolation from the message and it is not permissible.And its booster: His saying: (And seek forgiveness), alert him to the proximity of the wandering as if he says the closeness It is close to the time to multiply the repentance.Fifth: As if it was said to him: He was overlooked in this world, this is the one who found it, which is the victory, the conquest, and the abuse, and God is up to God, and for you to say: When you found your maximum, in the world, then take to the hereafter to win these high climics.The questioner: We mentioned that the most correct is that the surah was descended before, and it was open, and those who said: It came down after it, then it was made, then it was made.Peace be upon him, and this is not the same as the surah, except for two days, a progressive day for praise and forgiveness, and a fighter said: He lived after it.To you, your religion [Al -Ma’idah: 3] So he lived after two days one day and then the verse of the kinship descended, so he lived after five days, and then he descended: After five and thirty one day, then he went down: and fear a day in which you will be returned to God [Al -Baqarah: 281] So he lived after one of the ten days, and in the narration of a day, he lived.And God knows how it was.
