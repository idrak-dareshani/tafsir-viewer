The researcher of the Quran, his exalted: No, what he has commanded.He knew that his saying (all) is a deterrent to a person about his arrogance and his lifting, or from his disbelief and his renovations on the denial of al -Tuhidah, and on his denial, and the evil, and the evil, His saying: When he spent what he had commanded, one of them is one: Mujahid said: No one will spend what was ever.In which I have a look, because his saying: When the guerrilla spends in it a hand to the precedent, and it is the human being in his saying: He was killed by the person who is the one who is unbelieving.The human being here is all people, but the infidel man, so he said: When he spends how he can be carried on all people?.And the second: that the meaning is that the raised man who is arrogant did not spend what he was commanded by the blessing of the arrogance, as the meaning is that that is the infidel person who did not spend what he does not have to do.The evidence of God, and manipulation in the wonders of his creation and the evidence of his wisdom.And the third of it: The professor said Abu Bakr bin Fukk: Whatever God did not spend for this infidel what he has commanded from faith and left the arrogance, but rather what he did.He knew that the habit of God is a neighbor in the Qur’an that the more the evidence is mentioned in the same, for he reminds the signs of the evidence that is in the way of the existence The habit and mentioned the evidence of the horizons, and began with what the human being needs.He said: Let the human being look at his food, which he lives in, how he enlisted his command, and he does not doubt that he is the position of administer One of them: advanced, which is the things that are inevitable until it enters that food in existence.The second: a late, and it is the things that are inevitable in the body of the human being until the benefit of that food is eaten, and when the first naughty was the first About the suspicion, the gratitude of God is not satisfied with its remembrance, because the Qur’an is not necessary and that it is in terms of the benefit of all the creation, and there is no creation, and there is no way And the suspicion, and this is what is meant by his saying: let the human being to his food and know that the plant is from the country that comes from the heaven that falls in the earth, and the heavens, and the heavens, and the heavens.Like the female, he was mentioned in the Bayan, the drop of the diameter.His saying: We poured water in it, and in which there are two issues: the first question: His saying: (our Sabbar) is what is meant by the sickness, then he looks at it as how it is the same The great water, and how it remains suspended in the atmosphere of the sky with the absence of its weight, and contemplated in its causes of closeness and distant, until the effect of you is the effect of God His rule, and in the manner of this world.The second question: Reading that we are fractured, and it is on the authority, and that I open at the beginning of food and estimation: let the human being to see that we are the water of the water.That was an interpretation to look at his food, as his saying (to them is forgiveness) [Al -Nour: 26] an interpretation of the promise, and whoever opens the meaning of the meaning These things are comprehensive on the eating of food and its juice, so it is like it: they ask you about the month of the forbidden in which it is a fight in it [the cow: 217] and the saying Fire [Al -Baraouj: 4,5].
