The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: When he separated, he was tired of the soldiers, in which there are issues.The first question: Know that the face of this verse is what before it appears with the ability For him, and they answered the path under his opinion.When he separated them, that is: he separated them from his country and cut off from him, and the meaning of the chapter is the piece, it is said: a chapter, if it is cut off from the right The bone is a chapter, and the man detailed his partner and his brilliance, and it is said to breakthroughs, because he cuts off the breastfeeding, and separated from the place, and he made it from the place, His saying: And when the elder was separated [Yusuf: 94], the owner of the “scout” said: His saying: He separated from a position as well as his origin, so he separated his soul, then for the sake They deleted the verb until it became in the ruling other than the one who is transcendent as it is said: separated, and the soldiers are the collection of a soldier and every kind of creation is a soldier, for a single person Many: It is the soldiers of God, and it is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: The second question: It was narrated that Taltout said to his people: He does not want to come out with a man who builds me with a building that he did not empty, nor a dealer, and a trader, or a man It was not built on it, and only the young man was empty, so he gathered to him from those who chose the eighties of a thousand.* * * As for his words, he said: He said that God is a river of you, and he has anxes: the first question: they disagreed that this is the one who was, so he said: He is the most, and he is the most, and he is the most Because his saying is inevitable and that it is supportive to a precedent mentioned, and the previously mentioned is Taltout, and then this is entrusted to be the saying of the one who is from it The time, and on this estimation, it is not necessary for a prophet to be a prophet, and it is necessary to be by himself, so there must be no living from his Lord, and that he has been A Prophet.And the second saying: The saying of this saying is the prophet mentioned in the beginning of the verse, and the appreciation: when he separated, I was tired of the soldiers, and their Prophet said: God is the one who is good It is the most beautiful of peace be upon him.* * * God is the highest shouting of a mark before the meeting of the enemy, which is distinguished by those who patience with war who does not patience; Because the return before the enemy’s meeting does not affect the effect of the enemy, when this was the goodness before the enemy’s fighter, there is no crime, he said: So God is.The second: It is up to them, so that they would be used to the patience.* * * The third question: in the river, sayings: one of them: It is the saying of Qutah and Al -Rabi’ah, that it is a river between the two and the two.“ The third saying: It was narrated by the owner of the “scout”: that the time was a loyalty, so they walked a reward, so they asked God to run for them as a river, and he said: “God” is a river, and he said: The river.* * * The following question: His saying: You are wrapped in a river, that is, what you are conquered by the servant, as he said: We created the human being from the sperm of the rituals of the man: Among the people, but it is for the appearance of something, and it has proven that God is exalted and does not reward and does not punish his knowledge, but he does so with the appearance of the actions, and there is no By leaving; There is no gendarmerie in the name He came to the two languages.The fifth question: a river and a river with the silence of the distraction and its sacrifice for two languages, and all three three are stuffed with a letter from the letters of the throat, so it comes to you.And rocks, poetry and poetry, and they said: Sea and sea, and the poet said: As if it was created from the stone of the stone ∗∗∗, then there is no one between his hands and dew, the work To be seen in his palm * * * * As for his words, the Almighty: Whoever drinks from him is not from me and whoever does not feed him, then he is from me, he has the questions: Like the dirt, it means that it is not from the people of my religion and my obedience, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: and the believers and the believers are some of them, some of them are commanded by [Repentance: 71] Then he said before this: the hypocrites and the competitors are some of them who are commanded by denunciation and forbid from the well -known [Al -Tawbah: 67] “There is no one who does not have mercy on us, and our greatness has not decided.” “That is, it is not on our religion and our people, and God knows.The second question: The people of the language said that it was not feeded by any that he did not taste, and it is from the food, and it falls on food and drink.This is what the people of the language said, For the good one: one of them: that if a person is thirsty, then he drank the water and wanted to describe that water with good and pleasant So he describes him with the delicate food, and he said it: Whoever does not fed it with it is that, even if he is overwhelmed by the thirst until he is that of that water in the mouth of his mouth is like that in the mouth of his mouth The good is that it is obligatory for him to be able to do not drink.The second: Whoever made The water is in his mouth, and he sheds it from the mouth, then he is true to him that he tasted him and his food, and he does not believe that he is his drink, and he said: The prevention is defined by drinking, but when he said: Whoever does not feed it was the prohibition in drinking and in the hurdoster He shed with it and found a light and comfortable.The third question: that he said at the beginning of the verse: Whoever drinks from him, then he is not from me, then he said after him: He who did not feed him and he is not said: Whoever does not say: The verse is the first of it, except that it left that memory, (P-154) and this is a for a sake, which is that the jurists have disagreed that those who are not drinking?Abu Hanifa said: He does not come out unless he kneeled from the river, even if he was unaware of the water from that river and his drink is not a matter Its drink is connected to that thing, and this is not obtained except that he is drinking from the river, and the rest said if the water is alienated with the waters A well -known metaphor.If you know this, then say: If his saying: Whoever drinks from him, he is not from me, his appearance is that the forbidden is a shortage of drinking from the river, and it is not the right to It will be inside the prohibition, so when this involvement was based on the first memory, it was mentioned in the second memorial, what removes this thumb, so he said: Whoever does not give it to me, then he did not.And drink to water, not to the river, to remove that dusty.* * * As for his saying: Except for those who have been dispersed in his hand, he has books: The first question: Ibn Katheer, a beneficial, and Abu Amr (Gharafa).Yaqoub and successor, and the son of the son of Amir, Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i read, the people of the language said: The sunflower with the small, the little thing, which is the one who gets in the palm, The verb, which is the time, is one time, and the same is eaters and eating, it is said: so that it is eaten in the day and one, and I have not been eaten with them except for any eating Like the peak, and it is said: the garden is from the meat by the guarantee of the casserole from it, and the groove of the meat was groove, meaning: I cut it one time, and the time of the time, and the time: By the guarantee of the amount of between the two feet, and the step is to make a single time, and the cold said: A wees of the openness are a source that falls on a little By guaranteeing the name of the filling of the palm or what is known for it.* * * It was presented in the remembrance of the curse.The third question: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: The sunset was drinking from it and his animals and his servants, and he carried from it.And I say: This words are enticed and voices: one of them: that it was permissible to take from water what he wanted once, with a single room, in which the one was in the same way It is sufficient for him and his horses, and to carry him with himself.The second: He used to take a few, except that God Almighty makes the blessing in it until it is enough for all these, and this was a miracle of the Prophet, for the time of this time The great creation from the little water in the time of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: So drink from him except a few of them, and he has books: The first question: Read Abi and Al -Amash (except for a few).To the meaning, and their symptoms from the memorial, because his saying: They drink from it in a sense: they did not obey him, and he did not carry it to him as if he said: He did not say: The second question: It was mentioned that the intended one of this is the one that the friend is distinguished from the adulterer, and the agreed from the violator, so when the one is mentioned, the one who is mentioned is the one.Perhaps for this fight, they are those who do not drink from this river, and that all (P-155) are those who drink from it, because they are not hurt in this fight, and it was in the heart of the heart That is the fighting, not the grace of the drink, so the agreed from the violator, and the truth about the enemy, and it is narrated that the companions of Taltout, when they are abandoned by the righteousness, The most of them fell in the river, and they were more drinking, and the people of them obeyed the command of God Almighty, and they did not increase the abuse, but those who drink and immortalize them The thirst prevailed over them and did not narrate, and they remained on the shore of the river, and they fell on the meeting Salim.The third question: the few who did not drink: It is four thousand, and the famous, which is the saying of goodness, was that they were on the number of people with a three -day number The believers, and the evidence for him that the Prophet ﷺ said to his companions on the day of the day: “You are the day on the number of people of the people of Taltout when they crossed the rhino Appointed: We were three and three men.* * * As for his saying: When he visited him and those who believed with him, they said: There is no energy to us today with the hearts and his soldiers, so he has two questions: Those who disobeyed God and drank from the river, they returned to their country and did not turn with him to the return of the enemy except those who obey God Almighty In the chapter of drinking from the river, but they disagreed that their return to their country was before the river crossing or after it, and in it the saying: the first is that it is not the one who crossed it The saying of matters: The first: that God Almighty said: When He and those who believed in him, he who believed with him, is what is meant by saying: Those who believed with him, and those who are in the way of those who are in the way God Almighty, all the innervation, and then specialized those who expressed the river, we knew that the river crossed one but the obedient.The second pilgrimage: the advanced verse, which is the saying of a story about Taltout, who is drinking from it, then it is not from me, which is not from my companions in my travel, like the man who says: You are from us in this matter, he said: And the meaning of drinking from it, that is: to cause it to return, and that is for the corruption of their religion and their heart.The third pilgrimage: that the intended of this is that the obedient is distinguished from the disobedient and the ritual, until he dismisses them from himself and returns them before The enemy, and if the intended one of this is the case is only this meaning, the phenomenon was that he had disgraced them from itself in that time and what is given to them in the transit.The second saying: He accompanied all his soldiers, and all of them crossed the river and were intended to prove this saying to his saying, "The Almighty said: In the vicinity, his soldiers, and the knowledge that these words are not appropriate for the believer who is criticized for the command of his Lord, but only the bond or the evildoer, and this is a weak, and this is a weak Weakening it from the faces: one of it: it is possible to say: if you are tired of what is determined to equate the river and succeed the most people, the one who is the successor is that we are not in this way that we are in this way.Today, we are with the hearts and soldiers, so we are excused in this backwardness, the best thing in the door is to say: The fulfillment is in his saying: when it is required, it is necessary that it is that it is necessary The day is in the vicinity, but it was signed after the equivalent, except that we say: It is necessary to say: If you are divided and the believers, when they visited the river, and the people, they did not ask, and they will not be.Because of the backwardness, then they mentioned that, and the river was in the greatness where it is forbidden from the integrity, (P-156) and it is necessary for the person to be intended to be the prejudice, This estimation, forms is also a lower.The second answer is that it is impeded to be said: the believers who crossed the river were two parties: some of them who love life and the deception of the death and the dead and the fear Satisfy it, and for those who were courageous, the heart of the heart does not meet the death in the obedience of God Almighty.The first section: they are those who said: There is no energy for us today.And the second section: they are those who answered their saying: How much in a little category A lot of category dominated.The third answer: it is possible to say: the first section of the believers, when they witnessed the lack of their impressive, they said: There is no energy for us today, with the sins of the people, and the sins of the We settled on the killing, because there is no way to the righteous of God.And the second section said: We do not seek yourself, but we hope from God, the conquest and the slander, so the first impatience was to be desired in testimony and the lord of the paradise.Impressive in ordering the conquest and victory, and on this estimation, it is not in one of the two sayings what is the other.The second question: the energy is a source of the enemy, it is said: I trusted the thing with an enemy and an energy, and the same is the obedience, and the name of the obedience, and the raid of the raid, He answers an answer and the name is the gate, and in the example: he was offended with a gap, that is, an answer.* * * As for his words, the Almighty said: Those who think that they are the people of God, so he has a question, which is that he is the Almighty, why did they make them think and did not make them firm?And his answer: that the cause has things in it: the first: it is the saying of Qutah: that what is meant is from the deadness of God dead, he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: God hated him for his meeting with his meeting.They think that they are God.The second: Those who think that they are the people of God He reached the obedience, the most noticeable of the matter, except for those who have informed God of the punishment of his command, and this is the saying of my father Muslim, and he is good.The third face: that the meaning is: He who thinks that they are obedient to God, and that is because the human being cannot be a heir that this is the one who does this work, this is the one who does this.Because he may have come in it with something of listening and hearing, and it is not a pure structure, so that it is not the act of obedience, but it is possible for it to be in it, but it is possible for it to be the one who thinks it And the salvation.The loud face: We mentioned in the interpretation of his Almighty saying: that the coffin comes to you, in which there is a knife from your Lord, that what is meant by the caliph is the saying In the sarcophagus, there are divine books descending on the forefathers, indicating the victory of victory and the bonds of the heroes and his soldiers, but it was not in that way and that was not in that He gets at the first time or after it, so he said: Those who think that they are the people of God, meaning those who think that they are the ones who are not, and the count of God Because his obtaining the sentence, even if it is cut It was nothing but (P-157).Fifth face: He said a lot of the interpreters: What is meant by his saying: They think that they are the people On the path of metaphor, because of the suspicion and those who are similar in the affirmation of the belief.* * * As for his saying: How many categories are a large group that has a many categories with the permission of God, then he has questions: the first question: what is meant by him is the one who said: Today, we are the same as the virginity and its soldiers, and the meaning is that there is no lesson in the number of number, but the crossing is with the divine support, and the heavenly victory, then if the state comes, then the state comes, then the state comes, then the state comes And humiliation, and if the cultivation comes, then it is not possible in the many number and the number.The second question: the category: the group, because some of them have fulfilled some of the group, and Al -Zajaj said: The origin of the category is from their saying: So, then I will come.I cut off, as the group is one of the people, as if it is a piece of them.The third question: Al -Farah said: If it was canceled, “from“ here it is permissible in the “category” of lifting, the share and the lightness, but the monument is that it (how) is the enemy, then it is a We are one of the twelve men, and the reduction is the inclusion of a letter (from) from it, and the raising is on the intention of the verb as if it is the same.* * * As for his saying: God is with the patient, there is no suspicion that the intention is the one who is cursed and the victory, then it is possible that this is a saying to those who said: To be a saying from God Almighty, even if the first appears.
