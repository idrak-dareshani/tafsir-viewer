The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: Or was you a testimony when he attended the death of the death, when he said to his sons what you worship after me, they said: We worship your God, and God bless you One of them is a Muslim, a nation that has been given to her what she had earned and for you what you have earned and do not ask what they were doing, know that he is the one who is the one It is a language in the will of his sons in religion and Islam, and his obstacle mentioned that he is punished by the guardian of his sons with the same as that, as a certainty of the argument on the authority of the people, and the righteousness, Institutions: The first question: Know that “a mother” is the one who is a letter of understanding, or the letter of compassion, and it resembles the letters of kindness “or“ and it comes to me Before it and cut it from it, but the connected, know that if you say: more than you or Amr?If you do not know that one of them is at him, and you ask: Are there any of these with you, then there is no crime, his answer was, no, or yes, but if you knew, this is the same But you do not know that the one has more or old, so I asked him about the awareness.What do you know that one of them is for you, but it is this or that?As for the interruption, they said: It is in the sense of “but” with the thunderbolt of the question, for example: if he says that it is for the camel or a mother, then if he said this words, then it is the same, then it is the same, then it is the same as the words of it.He came to tell the necessity of his belief that it is the camel, then the doubt came to him and wanted to strike from that news and to understand that it is it, whether it is, or not, for the sake of the first?And the understanding is that it is that it is intended to give up the confession, so he said: It is for the camels or a neighbor who has said: It is for you to do so.It is not completely connected to his saying: It is for a camel, how and that has been fell in the shadow of it with the disagreement of the communication, so if you say: In the sense of whichever of you, and it was not “what“ after ”or“ broken down what was before it with a sign that the age of two centuries is more and enough is a sign of that of you So you say: Which of you is?In the book of God (P-68), he came from the two of the two types, while the communicated, the Almighty said: You are more creative as the mother of the sky, which is raised by the one who raised it.[28] As for the interruption, it is said: “The book is not downloaded, there is no doubt in it from the Lord of the two worlds, or they say it is his absence [the prostration: 1-3], and God knows best, but he says, but he says: The distress is about the first and the interrogation after it, as it is not in the words, that is, as it was in your saying: more than you are or Amr?And whoever does not achieve the interpreters, they say that “the mother” is the home of the ghost, and that is not correct.Al -Muntaqa: You join the meaning of, but if you know this presenter, then say: “Umm” in this verse separated or communicated?In it is saying: The first is that it is a disorder of what before it and the meaning of the hamsti in it denial, that is,: Rather, you were not martyrs, and the testimony is the whole of the martyr When he attended the death of the death, and the speech with the people of the book, as if he was up to them, he said to them when they used to benefit You will testify the commandments of the prophet with religion, and if you witnessed that, you would have left what you have from the religion and you will desire in the debt of Muhammad, which is the one who was the same And Jacob and the path of the Prophet, peace be upon him after him.If it was said: the understanding is the path of denial, but it is directed to the false words, and the one who says about Yaqoub in this verse is not a false words, but it is true, but it is true, but it is true.Interesting on the way to deny it?We said: The understanding of the path of denial is attached to the allegation of their claim, when this is the one that God has denounced.As for his remembrance after that, from the saying of peace be upon him: what you worship after me, it is a detailed words, but if it is up to the one who has been denied by the one who has been denied by the After that, how is that command.The second saying: that the “mother” in this verse is connected, and the way of that is to be appreciated by a deleted before it, as it was said: You call on the Prophet, as well The urbanization of the dead; It means that your parents are among the children of Israel, who were seen for him, when he called his children to the religion of Islam and the neutrality, and you have taught that, so what you call on the authority of the people.* * * As for his saying: when he said to his sons, he has two questions: the first question: Al -Qafal said his saying: He said: “He said:“ He said: “He said:“ He said: “ The second is the time.The second question: the verse is indicative that the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon them, were in their children in the chapter of religion, and they were in the way of it.* * * As for his saying: What you worship after me, in his two questions: the first question: not to be preserved.“What” for other minds, so how to release him in the slave?And his answer from two faces: The first: that “what” is general in everything and the meaning is anything you worship.The second: His saying: You do not worship as you say when he asks for limit and drawing: What is human?.(P-69) The second question: His saying: From me, but his saying: They said: We worship your God, and God is your fathers The verse holds two of the people of ignorance: the first: the imam said: The children of Jacob are satisfied with the imitation, and it is upon him peace be upon him As soon as it was denied by them, it was indicated that the imitation is sufficient.The second: teaching.They said: There is no way to the knowledge of God, except by learning the Messenger, the Imam and the evidence for this verse, for they did not say: We worship the god, who is the one who is the one who said: We worship the god, whom you worship and your fathers worship Him, and this indicates that the way of knowing is learning.The answer: Just as there is no significance in the verse that they have known God with the mind of the mind, so there is also no significance that they have not recognized God except for God And learning, then the saying of imitation and learning when it was prolonged by the evidence that our knowledge is that the faith of the people was not on this way, but it was the one who had the same, but it was a matter What is in the chapter is to say: Why did they not remember the method of the recipient.The answer to it is from his faces: the first: that is more severe in the saying of the explanation of the attributes of God, the Almighty, with His Judaism, His knowledge, his ability, and his justice.And the second: that it is close to the same as the soul of peace be upon him, as if they said: We are not going on, except for the same way Worship for him.And the third of it: Perhaps this is a sign of the male of evidence on the existence of the champions on what God Almighty mentioned at the beginning of this surah in his saying: O you who worship you And those who are before you [the cow: 21] and we want them with their saying: They said, worship your God, and the God of your fathers, that is: we worship the god who is upon you The method is that of that, to the recipient, not to the conversion.The second question: Al -Qafal said: And in some of the phrases that peace be upon him, when Egypt entered, he saw the people who worship the fire and the one who is afraid, so he is afraid.He died, so he said to them, this saying is that they are satisfied with the commitment to the worship of God Almighty.The judge narrated that Ibn Abbas: that peace be upon him, gathered them to him at the death, and they were worshiping the two and the fires, so he said: O my son?They said: We worship your God, and the god of your fathers, then the judge said: This is far from Jahin: The first: that they turned to the confession of the neutrality of the mourning of the one who does not know.The second: It is the highest mentioned in the book, the state of the tribes of the children of Jacob, and that they were a good people, and that is not appropriate for them.The third question: His saying: Abraham, Asmail, and Isaac, the kindness of Bayan for your fathers.Al -Qafal said: It was said that he mentioned the reminder of Asaqal on Isaac, because the hearing was the elder than Isaac.The following question: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The brotherhood and the sisters of the father and the mother or the father do not fall into the grandfather, and it is the saying of Omar and Uthaman and the servant Masoud and increase, may God be pleased On the authority of them while he said the money, my father Yusuf and Muhammad.And Abu Hanifa said: They are fell asleep, and he is the saying of Abu Bakr al -Sadiq and Ibn Abbas and Aisha, may God be pleased with them, and from the followers, the saying of the good Those who say: They do not fall into the hard, they say: one of them: that the grandfather is the best of the two things: either the argument with them or the third of the money, then the brother is between the brother (P-70) For the male, like the female luck, and this is the time of Zayd ibn Thabt and the saying of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him.The second: It is in the home of one of the brotherhood that is not decreased by the division of the bond.Hanifah on his saying that the grandfather is a father and the father embarrasses the sisters and brothers, so it is necessary for the grandfather to be veiled them, but we said: The grandfather is the father of the verse and the effect.As for the verse, this is the two words, and it is the saying of the Almighty: They said, worshiping your God, and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Asmail, and Isaac, so he called the father.If it was said: I have given it a uncle, and it is hearing with the fact that it is not a father.We said: The recovery is the evidence of the truth, and it is left to work with it in the right of a blindness to a guide in which he rose up, and he remains in the rest of the second verse of the verse.Peace be upon him: I followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob [Yusuf: 38].As for the impact, what was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: Whoever wants him to his cursing with the stones, the grandfather is a father.A father and does not make the father of the father a father, and if it is proven that the grandfather is a father, he must enter under his saying of the Almighty: His parents inherited him, then his third mother [Al -Nasi: 11] The brotherhood, as the father deserved it without them if it is remaining, Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: We do not surrender that the grandfather is a father, and the evidence is upon him and his faces: On that the grandfather is a father, so we are inferring on the fact that he is not a father with his words, the Almighty: and he commanded him to be the sons of his sons and the one who is the cow: 132] Because he was distinguished from them, if if the arbiter was in the father, the father would have been in the structures in the rules, and when it was not, it was not the same.And the second: If the grandfather was a father on the truth, he would not have been correct for those whose father died and his grandfather is alive to be negated that he has a father, as he is not valid in the predominant father, and when it is true that it is true that he knows that the truth.If it was said: The name of the father, and if it is obtained in all, the rank of the lowest is close to the rank of the distant, so this is true in which the negation is valid.We said: If the name was a right in them, they would not have been in the presence Because of the exile of the father’s name.And the third of it: If the grandfather was a father on the truth, the saying would be correct that he died and succeeded a mother and many fathers, and that is what was not called by one of the jurisprudence.And he pushed it: If the grandfather was a father and did not doubt that the companions are known to the language, they would not be dispersed in the inheritance of the grandfather, and if the grandfather was a father, the grandfather was a mother, and if it was a mother The suspicion is in the inheritance of the grandfather until the father of Bakr, may God be pleased with him, needs the question about him, so this is evidence indicated that the grandfather is not a father.Fifth: His Excellency said: God commands you in your children to the remembrance like the female luck [Al -Nasiya: 11] If the grandfather was a father, then the son of the son was not a son.With the necessity of this verse, the inheritance of the son of the Son is with the resurrection of the Son, and when it was not like that, he knows that the grandfather is not a father, so the verse is in the That the grandfather is a father, so the answer is on the face of the assignment of it from the faces: the first: that he reads Abi: (And God is a wilder) with the ultimate of your fathers, except that this does not praise the sake of the sake of the ritual The recovered readings are pushed, but the answer is to say: He release the father’s memorial to the grandfather and uncle; And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “This is the rest of my fathers.” And he said: “They respond to my father.The denial of the name of the father is valid for the grandfather, and if it was a truth, it would not be like that, and as for the saying of Ibn Abbas, then the name is released to him, not to the ruling, not to the ruling, not to the ruling, not to The languages ​​do not fall into the convergence among the people of the tongue, and God knows.As for his words, the Almighty: One God, it is a replacement, and God is your fathers as his saying: with a false corner, [Al -Alaq: 16, 15] or on the one who is the one, that is, you want, that is, you want, His saying: And we have Muslims in his face and faces: one of them: that he is a state of the act of worship or from his effective to the horror of the distraction to him in “for him”.And secondly: It is permissible to be a sentence of worship.And the third of it: to be a certain syntax, that is, and from our condition that we have Muslims who are glorified to the neutrality or those who are.As for the saying of the Exalted: that is a nation that has been devoid, it is a sign of those who mentioned God Almighty in the advanced verse, and they are Abraham, Asmail, Isaac, and Jacob.And the "nation" is classified.“I have gone”, and I have gone off, and I have been bound, and the meaning is that I have given you their news to you and what they had of Islam and the pretext to Islam, so you will not be in the authority of you.Do what they did, for if you did that, you will benefit, and if you do not, you will not be intended with their actions, and the verse is indicative of the questions: Balan Al -Takilid, because his saying: It has what has earned it indicates that the earnings of every one who concluded with it and does not benefit from it, and if it was not the same, and if it was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the same The fabricated is full of followers, as if he said: I did not mention the story of their conditions, asking you to imitate them, but you will be alerted to what they are obligated to They were from the mortality.The second question: the verse is indicative of their desire for faith, and the followers of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and their warning against his violation.* * * The third question: the verse indicates that the children are not rewarded for the obedience of the fathers with the disagreement of the saying of Juda that the righteousness of their fathers will benefit them, and it will be fulfilled by it Peace that he said: “Oh, the grace of the aunt of Muhammad, O Fatimah, you are Muhammad, you will come to me on the Day of Resurrection with your tones, not with your genealogy, so I do not sing from you.” And he said: “And whoever slows down his work, his lineage is not accelerated with him.” And God Almighty said: So there is no lineage between them on the day and they do not ask [the believers: 101] and the Almighty said: There is nothing in your faithful nor my aspirations for the people of the book, whoever does not do it.Its exaltation said: And do not gain every soul except for it [Al -Anam: 164], and do not visit and be overburdened by the other [Al -Anam: 164] and he said: So if you do not, then what is it for you You are pregnant [Al -Nur: 54].* * * The following question: The verse indicates the saying of those who say: The children are tormented by the disbelief of their fathers, and the Jews said: They are tortured in the fire.Their fathers are to take the calf, and it is the saying of the Almighty: They said that the fire will not touch us except for numbers.* * * The fifth question: the verse is indicative of the servant is rejected and the people of the Sunnah are dispersed and dispersed in the interpretation of the gain, but the people of the Sunnah are the age of the Sunnah The meaning of the slave is not a reinformed, the entry of something of the symptoms in its capacity (P-72) from the numbers to the existence, then after their agreement to this prayer, this is the same.Three interpretations.One of it: It is the saying of Al -Ash'ari, may God be pleased with him, that the ability is a characteristic attached to the estate from other than the effect of the ability in the power, but rather the power of the capacity God Almighty, just as knowledge and knowledge obtained the creation of God Almighty, but the thing that was created with the creation of God is the Almighty, and it is the attachment of the righteousness.And the second: that the same action is found in the capacity of God Almighty, then he will obtain that act and describe his being obedience or disobedience, and this is the righteousness of the ritual.He said Abi Bakr Al -Baqalani.And the third of it: that the urban ability and the capable ability, if they are suspended with one capacity The one who is able to do with them, and as if the servant’s action was signed with the insistence of God, then this is the gain, and this is attributed to the father of Isaac Al -Asfarini, because it is narrated from him.With the appointment.As for those who say that the urban destiny is influenced, they are the understanding of the first: the first: those who say that the ability with the supplicant requires the verb, for the good is the Almighty Glory be to him and the exalted is the one who put the causes that lead to the entry of these actions in the strains and the servant is the one who is gained in the sense that the influenced in the rituals of the verb is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the effect The two standing in it, and this is the gold of the imam of the two sanctities, may God have mercy on him, his choice in the book that he called the regime, and the saying of Abu al -Husayn is the one who is not.The second parting of the disgrace: They are those who say: the ability with the supplicant does not require the verb, but the servant is able to do the action and the blessing is possible He left, and this action and gain, the disgrace of the poetry said: If the servant is able to fall into the creation of God Almighty, then if he creates it, then he is in it: That is the time for that act, and if he does not create it in it: it is impossible for him to be described in it.And if it was not the same, it is possible to do the action and the blessing, and there is no meaning for the leadership except that, for the servant is the one who is not a destiny, and it is also so.Either it is a reality in the capacity of God, or the deceased was not fell in the capacity of God, or it was signed by the two capabilities together, if it is signed with the power of God, the Almighty is the best of God.How can it be a consequence of it?And if he signed the power of the servant, then this is the one who is required.And if he signed with the two capabilities with this, then this is referred, because the power of God is transmitted in the rhythm, so when the ability of God is attached to Him, then the Almighty is the Almighty The effect is a weak saying, because the deprived of the sitting in the doorstened house is not only the job of that bias, so this work is that it is the same.The soul of the one who has been created by God has created it in it, and this is the eyes of the unbearable and if he obtained the ability of the servant, then it is the one who is required.As for the saying of Al -Jafraini, it is weak, because we have shown that the power of God is transmitted by the effect, so it does not remain for the sake of the servant with the effect of the effect.The people of the Sunnah said: The universe of the servant is based on finding and creativity is referred to his faces: the first: that the servant was found for his verbs, for his verb, for the one who is a scholar, for the sake An unreasonable scientist with that interrogation, so it is not found for it.And the second: If the servant was found for the same thing; It is only what the servant wanted, and that is not like that, because the infidel intends to obtain knowledge, so it is only ignorant.And the third of it: If the servant was found for his own action, it would be extensively for that action, which is added to the same deeds (P-73) and the same one because it is the same.We are reasonable for the same and the same in the capacity of the slave of the servant, and it is a reasonable person, and the reason is other than the one who is forgiven, then that is the one who is a sharp one, then it is a sharp With the servant, it is necessary to be aggravated to another founding, and it is necessary to sit in it and it is referred, and if God is the Almighty and the impact and the obligation of the arrival at the time of the exaltation of the one God is exalted, and that is not necessary for us in the glorification of God Almighty because he is an old man, so his founding was an oldest, so it is not obligatory to do so to that of the Mawjud.This is the summary of the words from the two sides and the struggles between the two parties in the provinces and the suffering many, and God is the guidance.
