The Quranic researcher (P-179) (Surah Al-Layl) is one of the twenty times angel ﷽ and the night if he fades and the day and the day if it is evacuated and the male and the female (Surah al-Layl) was created).God: This surah has descended in Abu Bakr and his agreement on the Muslims, and in the illiteracy of Bin Khalaf, his disagreement, and his disbelief in God, but if it is for you, for you A general for people, not to see that God Almighty said: Your endeavor is a dispersal, and he said: I warn you a fire that is diligent and narrated from him, peace be upon him.So the Messenger of God ﷺ and we fell around him, so he said: There is no soul that is inclined, except that God has taught its place from paradise and fire, so we said: Oh, the Messenger of God?And he said: Do every easy entire person when he was created for him.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the night, if it is lost and the day, if it is evacuated, know that it is the highest of the night, which is in which every time is harmonized in it.The persecution, and the sleep that God made a comfort to their eternity and food for their souls, and then divided the day if it is evacuated; Because the day, if it came to reveal with its lights, what was in the world of darkness, and the time came from which people moved to their pensions, and it is fierce from it, and the one who moves from it, If all the eternity would be a night, the pension would not be excused, and if all of it was a day, the comfort would have gone, but the reconciliation was in their punishment, and he said: The night and the day is a successor [Al -Furqan: 62], and the night and the day are mocked for you [Al -Nahl: 12] As for his saying: And the night, if he is afraid, know that he is not up to him, then he is not remembered.The sun is from his saying: The night if it is deceived by the sun: 4].And his saying: And the day, if it is evacuated, that is, the appearance of the darkness of the night of the night, or the appearance, and the disclosure of the throat of the sun.And the saying of the Almighty: The male and the female created in it: (P-180) The first question: in its interpretation of its faces: one of them: that is, the great and powerful Qadir al-Qaddah al-Qaddah al-Qaddi The male and the female from one water, and it was said: They are Adam and Hawiya.And the second: that is, the male and the female.And the third of it: “What is“ in the sense of ”who“ and who created the male and the female, that is, who created the male and the female.The second question: The Prophet ﷺ “and the male and the female” and the son of Masoud read: To be the meaning: “and what was created”, meaning: what God has created, and that is: the creature of God, then he makes the male and the female as a result of it, that is:: And the creature of God is the male and the female, and it is permissible to purify the name of God because he is known that he is only immortal.The third question: the division by the male and the female, the division of all those with the signs who are the honor of the creatures; Because every animal is either a male or a female, and the shells are in itself, it is imperative that it be either male or female, with an indication that it is if it is a solution.Today, there is no male or female, and he had found a genius, so he was giving in his right.
