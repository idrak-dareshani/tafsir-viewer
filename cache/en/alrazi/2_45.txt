The researcher of the Quranic, his charity, and the Almighty: they seek patience and prayer, and it is great except for the humbled who think that they are their Lord, and that they are the one who is the one.They differed in those who address the saying of his charity and the Almighty: and seek patience and prayer, and a people said: They are the believers in the Messenger, he said: He said: “He said:“ He said: ” The debt of Muhammad ﷺ is hardly said to him: seek patience and prayer, so it is not a crime, and he must be shrouded to those who believed in Muhammad ﷺ, and it is not forbidden to be in the way of the rhetoric.After that, a speech to the believers in Muhammad ﷺ, and the closest that the addressees are the children of Israel; Because the discourse is notified of others, it is necessary to dismantle the systems.If it was said: How do they command patience and prayer with their being denounced by them?We said: We do not hand over their being denounced by them; That is because every one knows that patience is what is obligatory for patience with goodness, and that the prayer that is a humility of the creator and the dedication of the remembrance of God And its pests, but the disagreement in the Kayfiyyah is that the prayer of Jews is signed on a calamity, and the prayer of Muslims is on the other way.And if the matter of the matter is the one that is the unknown destiny that is removed from the mentioned And zakat, and that was difficult for them because of the leaving of the heights and symptoms of money and the prestige, there is no crime, God Almighty has attained this disease, and he said: and seek patience.* * * The debt of Muhammad ﷺ with patience, that is, with the love of the soul from the pleasures, then if you have wrapped yourself, then you will be granted to it and fear it, then if you are the same, then if you are.Because the one who is dispensed with the prayer is inevitable, and it is an accusative of the remembrance of God, glory and glory, and the remembrance of His Majesty and his abundance, and the remembrance of his mercy, and his goodness, Related to his obedience, and if he remembers his punishment, he left his disobedience, so he will make it easy for him to be obedient and left for disobedience.And the second: What is meant by patience is the fast; Because the fasting person is patient about food and drink, and whoever loves his soul from spending the lust of the stomach and the vagina is removed from it as the rituals of the love of the world, then if it is added to the prayer With the lights of the knowledge of God Almighty, but the fast is presented to prayer; Because the influence of fasting is to remove what is not empty and the effect of prayer in the acquisition of what is empty, and the negation is presented to the evidence, and because it is upon him the prayers and peace be upon him.From the fire.The book and the elderly in the way it is in it, the promise, the preacher, and the beautiful etiquette, and the remembrance of the destiny of creation to the house of reward or the house of punishment, as a desire for the last, They are on the human being at that time, then the ritual is left, and it is cut off from the creatures to the kiss of the creator of the Creator and the counterpart of this verse is the saying Believe, seek patience and prayer, God is with the patient [Al -Baqarah: 153].As for the saying of the Exalted: It is in this guerrilla, it is the face of it: one of them: the guerrilla is based on the prayer, that is, a heavy prayer, except for the humble.And the second: the guerrilla is a source of use to the use of his saying: and seek help.And the third of it: that he is domesticated to all the things that he commanded the children of Israel and forbade them from his saying: Remember my blessings that I have said to you The thing may be destroyed by a shortening, or it is confined to the gesture if it is trusted by the knowledge of the address The generosity of so -and -so, they mean the city, and the Almighty said: If God takes people with their injustice, what was left against it from the bear [Al -Nahl: 61] and there is no mention of the earth.As for his saying: a great person, that is, a hardship on these easy, on the humble, so they must be more and more rewarded, and the reward of the humble is the least, and that is the least of the one who is less.We said: It is not intended that the one who causes them to be tired is more than what is suffering from the humble, and how is that and the humbled is used by the prayer, and it is not.He is afraid to manage what he brings from remembrance, humiliation, and fear, and if the return is remembered, he will not be free from loss and grief, and if he is mentioned, then this is the same.The fearful, the heavily upon him, with the verb of prayer is greater, but what is meant by saying: It is a trustworthy on those who did not fear that it is from where it does not take care of it He is difficult for him to do.The one who has the same if the length is not imitated in its action, with a heavy weight of it; Because the preoccupation with what is not extensive in it is heavy on the printing, but the unit is the one who was lost in its action, the greatest of the benefits, and in its leaving the greatest of the harms, it is not the same In his action, he is hidden from the reward and the great treasure of the valuable and salvation from the painful torment, not to see it to say: those who think that they are the one who thinks that they are They fall off his reward and salvation from his punishment.His example, if it is said to the patient: all this bitter thing is, then if he believes that he has a healing in it, it is easy for him to This is in the difficulty of the matter in it, and upon him the saying of God and peace be upon him: We mentioned it, not because it was not the heaviest of it, and how was the prayer and peace be upon him until it was honored.As for fear, it is humiliation and subjugation.As for his saying: Those who think that they are their Lord, for those who are interpreted, in which they say: The first saying: that the thought in the sense of knowledge said: “ It is compared to the permanence of the contradiction, it requires that its owner be unjust to the Day of Resurrection, and that is a disbelief, and God Almighty praises this thought, and the glory of the It is obligatory for what is meant by the thought, we are the knowledge, and because of this metaphor is that knowledge and thinking are bought in the universe of each one of them, who is more likely, but the knowledge of the knowledge of the And the thought is a good man who is forbidden from the contradiction, so when it was affected by this direction, it is true that the name of one of them is valid on the other.What is between the correspondence is good, and the Almighty said: I thought that I am the metaphor of his accounts [Al -Haqaqa: 20] and he said: Do you not think that they are that they are the ones [Al -Muthanafis: 4] God mentioned that It is not permissible, and it is not permissible to send them to the permitted belief in the case, so it has proven that what is meant by thinking is the knowledge.(P-48) The second saying: that the memorization is carried on its appearance, which is the real thought, then we are the faces: the first: that you make the Lord’s metaphor for you, for the sake The Lord is caused by the death, so he released the cause and what is meant by the reason, and this is a well -known metaphor, so it is said to those who died: He is his Lord.If this is proven and said: It is a greatness except on the bereavens who think that the death is in every moment He does not separate his hearts, and they are turning to repentance; Because the fear of death is what strengthens the habit of repentance with his fear, in every case it is necessary to not believe in a shortage of it, then he will be obligated to him, so if he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the case That is, calling for him to the initiative to repent.The second: That you are interpreted by meeting the Lord with the fulfillment of the reward of the Lord, and that is a suspect, not known, for the ascetic is the game that does not cut it in the form of it.That is what he carries on the fullness of reverence.The third: the meaning that they think is that they are their Lord with their sins, for the fearful human being may misunderstand his soul and his heart God is exalted with his sins, so that he will hurry to repentance, and that is one of the characteristics of praise.There are two questions here: the question The first: Some of the companions inferred by saying: Their Lord is on the permissibility of the vision of God, the Almighty, and the disgrace said: The memorization of the meeting does not benefit the vision, And the knowledge.As for the verse, it was said by the Almighty: He followed them a hypocrisy in their hearts until a day they will be given [Al -Furqan: 68] and the hypocrite does not see his Lord, and he said: And whoever does this is the one who does not.[68] The presentation of the supplies: Fear God and know that you will meet him [Al -Baqarah: 223] For this is the infidel and the believer, and the vision does not prove to the disbeliever, so do not know that we do not know.The vision.As for the news, peace be upon him: “Whoever is inhabited by two days to be able to seize it with money that is a Muslim, who is God, and he is the one who is angry.” Because that is the description of the people of the fire, and the kinship is the saying of the Muslims who died: God is found, and they do not mean that he saw God, glory be to God Whoever throws it on the face of the veil between them, and for that, the man says if he is cursed from the Amir: I did not meet him after, even if he has seen him, and if he has seen him, and if he has seen him He says: I met him, even if he was a newspaper, and it is said: So that so, so that so and so I met from the shrewd so -and -so.The vision is also indicated by the Almighty saying: So the water is raised on something that was destined [Moon: 12], and this is valid in the right to body and is not valid for God.Al -Ashab said: The meeting in the origin of the language is a phrase for the prayers of one of the two bodies to the other, in terms of it, which he drew with a flat, said: This is not that if it is, and it is in it, and it is not in it, and it is not.The two in the way of the two years, because of the fact that the perception is established, so that it is forbidden to conduct the memorization on the hypocrisy, and it must be carried on the awareness; Because the release of the reason for the reason for the strongest faces of the metaphor, then you have proven that it is obligatory to carry it to keep the meeting on the perception, the most in the door is that it is in the door that it is in the door that it is in the door that it is The pictures are for a guide that is allocated, so it must be made on the awareness of the curses, and on this report, the questions are removed.As for his saying: He followed them a hypocrisy in their hearts until a day that they will be strengthened [Repentance: 77] and the hypocrite does not see his Lord, our saying: Let this sake of this is the one who is the one His account and his ruling, except that this guarantee is about the guidance of evidence, but it is to him at the forefront, so in this position, when we have been forced to say to him The people of their Lord, there is no harm in the expression of the memorial of his appearance, nor in the addition of this increase, so there is no crime, and the meeting must be worn with God (P-49) With the remembrance of the mental evidence that prevents the vision of the vision, we have been weak, and then it is evaluated.In this face.The second question: What is meant from the return to God is the Almighty to the reference to where they have your money, and that there is no one who has a good and no harm, as they were, as they were, as they were, as they were, as they were, as they were, as they were, as they were, as they were as well as So he made their destiny to the same as what they were on the first to return to God from where they were in the days of their life, and it was not the ruling for them and the rule of them And benefit them, even if God is the Almighty for them to all of them, and this verse may be exalted with two poverty from the heroes: the first: the body, so they said: It is referred, and when the return was established to God, the body of God was a body.The second: the reproduction, so they said: the return to the thing is preceded by the universe with it, so this verse was replaced by the costume of the signs of the sake of it, and it was in the form Spiritualism.The answer to it was obtained based on what was presented.
