The Qur’anic researcher: His Excellency said: And if the seas is carried out, it is read by lightness and tension, and there are faces in it: one of them: that the origin of the word is from the rituals of it If it is lifted in it, the wetness is in it, then there is nothing in the seas.The seas and the earth will become one thing in the end of the free and burning, and it is necessary that the land be the land when the seas of the seas will be revealed, so I walked, so it was raised, and it is raised, and it is fired.The mountains, when they were destroyed and dispersed, and became like dust, and that dust was at the bottom of the mountains, and the face of the earth became equal to the seas, and the sailor.And the second: that it is (tracked) in the sense of “it was made”, and that is because between the seas is a need for what he said: The two navies are gone between them.19,20] If God raises that barrier, one is overflowing in some, and the seas became one sea, and it is the saying of the dog.And the third of it: (it was carried out) I was unable, the lock said: This is the interpretation of its faces: the first: that the hell is in the seas of the seas, so it is now that it is not the same.The world, if the duration of the world ends, God is the effect of those fires to the seas, then it is in the kidney, a mosque in the cause of that.The second: that God Almighty throws the sun, moon, and shawls in the seas, so the seas will be made, caused by that.The third: that God creates a great fire, until that water will be dirty.And I say that this is a cost, and there is no need for anything from it, because the one who is on the authority of the world and the resurrection of the resurrection must be able to be able to do so that it is possible to do what he will do.And from the heart of its water, it is not necessary for it until the sun and the moon were thrown into it, and that the fire of hell will be under it.And know that these six signs can be fell at the beginning of the time of the world, and it can also be done after the resurrection of the resurrection, and it is not the same The two.As for the remaining six, it is specialized in resurrection.
