That is, the most important of them, the muscle was called a muscle because the moving powers are its origin from it, and it is said: a disease is a muscle, for the matter if it is accustomed, and it is the saying of Oas: With the one who gives you a guardian, if you are satisfied with you.Do not miss a discourse for whom?The most said: It is a speech for the guardians, and each of them said: It is a speech for the elders, and this is the choice, which indicates that it is the saying of the Almighty: They did not make them a single sentence, which is compounded by a condition and a penalty, for the condition is his saying: If you divorce the women, then they will be given their sake and the reward for them: There is no doubt that the condition, which is his saying: If you divorced women with a speech with the curtains, then the part is required, and it is his saying: So do not make them happy with a speech with them.If it was not like that The estimation of the verse has become: If you divorce the women, O husbands, do not lead them, O first, and then there is no condition between the condition and between the part of the part of the part Destroy the systems of the words, and it is eliminated by the words of God from his example and obligatory, for this is a strong words that are dead in the report of this saying, then it is the one who is sure: That one of the first verse is to divorce to this position, the whole speech was with the curtains, and the bit of what happened to the priority is a male, so this discourse was shown to the first.The second: What is before this verse is a discourse with the curtains in how they are treated with the women before the enemy of They were treated with the women after the enemies were made up, the words were persistent, and the synchronization is straight The good good, so the discourse of the speech was first.The pilgrimage of those who said: The verse is a speech for the princes of the faces: The first, not with the counseling, and it can be answered by it that the opposition was between this Hajj and between the Hajj that we mentioned, and the pilgrimage was mentioned.Because the preservatives are on the verge of speech, the first of the preservatives on the news of the one, and also because the narratives are inclusive, so I narrated that it was a reason that he was saying: A discourse with the couples, it was either a speech before the enemy or with its fulfillment, and the first is invalid; Because that is beneficial from the verse, and if we had this verse on the same as that of that meaning, it was a renovation of uniqueness, and also, then he said: We are married, if they are among them with the well-being, then it is forbidden (P-97) from the muscle if the consensus is obtained, and the consent does not get the marriage except after the expression, and the conquest is not With the speech, except after the elimination of the enemy, he said: Do not be determined to do the contract of marriage until the book is notified of it [Al -Baqarah: 235].The second is also false; Because after the enemy is not fulfilled, the husband is not able to lead the woman, so how does this forbidding it to him, and it is possible for him to be answered by the man His regimen is accustomed to the parties of the woman after the elimination of her enemy, and his right to others if he sees whoever speaks to her, and then he will make her happy, so that he will be happy with it The divorce or claims that he was returning it in the enemy, or it is destroyed by the one who serves it with the threat and the return, or the saying is offended in it, and that is that it is the one who is blessed with it.Interest in it, God Almighty has ended the face of These actions and defined them to leave these actions, more than them, and purify the sins of the sins.The third pilgrimage to them: They said: His exalted say: that they will marry their marriage with its meaning: and do not prevent them from being happy with those who have been married to them.And this speech does not remain unless we make the verse a discourse for the guardians; Because they were forbidding them from the return to those who were married to them before that, but if we made the verse a speech for the rituals, then this is not the same, then this is not true.The meaning of his saying: They are married to those who want to marry them, and they will be married, and the Arabs may be called something in the name of what is in the name of this.* * * The loyal question: The Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, holds this verse in Bayyan that the marriage is not for me, and it is not permissible.The verse is with the first.He said: And if this is proven, it is necessary to go to the guardians, not to the women; Because if a woman had to marry her himself or trust those who married her, the guardian would not be able What God has forbidden and exalted from the muscle, and where he was forbidden from the muscular, he was able to the muscle, and if the guardian was valued on the muscle, then you should not be the one who will be He knew that this reciprocate is based on that this speech is with the first, and what is in it was presented from the speakers, then if we are delivered, this is the old one, but it is not for you What is meant by his saying: Do not lead them to leave it and see it in that; That is because the majority in the days of the days is to leave my first opinion in the door of marriage, and if the journey is for them, and if it is under the authority of them, and if it is the time of their arms And then they are able to prevent them from being able to be able to enable them to be in their ease The interpretation of the verse, and also the stability of the muscle in the right of the guardian is obedient;

Because her constipation after the elimination of the enemy is not permissible, and when he said: Or they were happy with a well -being because it was after the enemy of the enemy, it will be a rest, and it is not possible, so there is no need, so it is not a need, so it is not.This is the verse in which we are forbidden, for God Almighty forbade them to be married to the marriage With the faces, and that is after the enemy of the enemy, for this is what is meant by the saying of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, the arrival of the two words is on the authority of the two words.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: If they are among them with the well -being, then he has questions: the first question: in the consensus and Jahan: one of them: what is agreed with the urbanization of the one Enemies.And the second: that what is meant by it is what is meant by what we mentioned in its words of exalted: and do not hold them back to us, so that the meaning of the verse is that every one of them is satisfied with this To his friend, until the beautiful companionship will get the age.The second question: Some of them said: Conflict with the well -known is the skill of the ideal, and they were raised on him with a jurisprudence, which is that if it is married to its soul and its soul is from it A thorough shortage, for the marriage is correct when Abu Hanifa, and the guardian has to be exposed to the causes of the deficiency of the skill, and the father of Yusuf said: The Hajj of Abu Hanifah, may God have mercy on him in this verse, is the saying of the Almighty: If they are among them with the well -being, and also that it is this decrease, he wanted to do so.Because the guardians are hurting with that; Because they are reprimanded by a few, and they are proud of its many, and for this they conceal the little skillful life, and they appear, the many, the many, the one who is a bad, and the same, and it They are hurt by that; Because it may be the need for the same as the skill of the likeness of each other, so that they are considered by this little skill, so do not go to the first of the first ones.[Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
