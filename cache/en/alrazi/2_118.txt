The researcher is the Almighty: He said: “Those who do not know if God does not speak to us or come to us a verse like that.Show the verses of people who are sure, I know that this is the naughty type ten of the doors of Juda, the Christians and the partners.On the authority of Jews, Christians, and the participants, what is praised in Al -Tawahid, which is that he is the highest of taking the boy, now he told them what he praises in the prophecy, and he said the most of those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones The evidence is upon him the saying of the Almighty: They said we will not believe in you until you have been broken from the earth to be wrapped in [Al -Asra: 90] and they said: Let us come to us, and they will come to us.أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنا المَلائِكَةُ أوْ نَرى رَبَّنا هَذا قَوْلُ أكْثَرِ المُفَسِّرِينَ, إلّا أنَّهُ ثَبَتَ أنَّ أهْلَ الكِتابِ سَألُوا ذَلِكَ, والدَّلِيلُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلُهُ تَعالى: يَسْألُكَ أهْلُ The book is that a book from the sky is revealed to them, so they asked Moses greater than that [Al -Nasa: 153].They know, and the people of the book are the people of science, our saying: What is meant is that they do not know the neutrality and the prophecy as it is empty, and the people of the book were like you.The second question: the report of the suspicion that they have been held by that if the wise if he wants to get something, then it is imperative that it is necessary for the rituals of the ritual to the one And young people, if you prove this, then say: God is the Almighty who speaks to the angels and spoke to Moses and you say: O Muhammad, he spoke to you and the evidence of God: What is revealed [Al -Nujam: 10] So why does he not speak to us as a matter and not stipulates your prophethood until the belief is confirmed and the suspicion will be confirmed, then if it is not, then it is not.It specializes in a verse and a miracle, and this is one of them who stabbed in the Qur’an, a verse and a miracle, because they have acknowledged that it is a miracle, so it is possible to say that they will not say: It is the Almighty who answered this suspicion by saying: Likewise, those who were before them said the same as their saying, the hearts of them are similar to that of us.This answer is that we have supported the saying of Muhammad ﷺ with miracles, and we have explained the validity of his saying with the verses, which is the Qur’an and the sales of the miracles, so this was a request The curse, and if it is like that, it is not obligatory to answer it for its faces: The first: that if the one is the same, then the cost is enabled the cost of the prayer to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one He asked the truth to be satisfied with that significance, so that he was not satisfied with it, and he asked for us to know that this is for the one who is in the door of stubbornness and the ritual, and it is not the same, so it was not the same His Excellency said: And they said if there were no verses to him From his Lord, say, but the verses are with God, but I am a clear vow, and I did not stop them, because we have revealed to you the book, which is recited to them [Al -Anakbout: 50, 51] The healing.And secondly: If there was a might in the knowledge of God, they would believe in this verse that he would do, but he knew that if he gave them what they have not asked, but he did not ask them, but he did not.He does that, and for that he said: If God knew about them, it would be good for them, and if they heard them, they would have assumed and they were exposed [Anfal: 23].And the third of them: Rather, there are types of corrupt in these verses, and they may have their destruction and release them if they were tightened after that on the denying, and it was a denying it The abandonment of the mandate, and it may be many and its punishment, praise in its in its place, which is miraculous, because the paranormal when it came to the time of the habit of the usual It is removed from his ingredient, and all of these are things that only God knows about the knowledge of the setup, so I have proven that their ambulance in these verses is not in the verses.As for the saying of the Exalted: their hearts are similar, so what is meant is that the lies of the messengers are similar to their sayings and their acts, so the people of Moses were ever, and they were ever.As they said: We will not be patient with one food [the cow: 61] and their saying: Make us a god as God has the gods [Al -Arif: 138] and say: [Al-Baqara: 67] And their saying: God showed us a wicker (P-28) [Al-Nasiya: 153].Likewise, these partners are ever in stubbornness, and for the sake of falsehood.As for the saying of the Exalted: The verses have been among us for people who are certain, so what is meant is that the Qur’an and others are among the miracles, such as the argument of the tree and the words of the wolf, and the ritual of the ritual Few, miraculous verses, and miraculous fragments for those who were asking for a long time.
