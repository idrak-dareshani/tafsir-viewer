The Qur’anic researcher is the first story of the stories of the children of Israel, did you not see to those who came out of their paths while they are thousands who warned the death, so he said to them, God will die, then revive them, then protect them.People, but the most people do not thank the words of the Almighty: Did you not see to those who came out of their exercises while they are the most cautious of the death, so he said to them, and God said to them.Fadl over people, but more people do not thank you, I know that his habit is the Almighty in the Qur’an to remember after the two rulings of the stories, and he will benefit That is to be overlooked by the leaving of murdes and stubbornness, and the more subjugation and purity, so he said: Did you not see to those who came out of their path.* * * As for his saying: (I did not see), he has questions: the first question: I know that the vision may come in the sense of vision of visionary and the heart, and that is a shame, and that is a goodness, and that As his saying: and show us your insults [Al -Baqarah: 128] it is: teach us, and he said: Let the people be governed by what I see God [Women: 105], meaning: He taught you, then this is the one who does not.The addressee is presented to him, and in that it is not like that, the man may say to others who want to know him, do not see what happened to what happened to me A curiosity, so this is permissible for the Prophet to be ﷺ and this story is only known with this verse, and it is permissible to say: the knowledge of it was a predecessor.(P-138) The verse, then God Almighty has revealed this verse on the authority of that science.* * * The second question: This speech is a discourse with the Prophet ﷺ except that it is not far from what he and his nation are, except that he is the same as the one who has the same Exalted: O Prophet, if you divorced women, divorce them for their promise [Divorce: 1].The third question: the entry of a word (to) in its words, the Almighty: Did you not see to those who are enticed to be for the sake of (to) with them a letter to you, to you, to you, as a letter to you.So, whoever knows the knowledge of a teacher, as if that teacher has reached that learner to that knowledgeable and that he is to him, so he is good for him) In it, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: Did you not see to your Lord how to extend the shadow [Al -Furqan: 45].As for his saying: To those who came out of their path, there are accounts: one of them: Al -Saddy said: It was a village in which the plague was located, and the general wise of its people, and those who died, and those who died, and those who died, And the rest of them remained in the sick and the calamities, then after the pleasure and the people were raised, those who raised the negligents, so he said: “Whoever remains from the sick, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the pleasure, said:“ Create for our escape from diseases and pests, and if the plague was second, we came out, so they fell and they were raised, while they were three and thirty, so when they came out of the valley, and from the hands of the valley from Above: If they die, then they will be and their bodies, so a prophet passed by them, he is said to him, Hazakil, so when he saw them and stood up to them and thought of them, then he would be in them.To show you how to live them?And he said: Yes, and he said to him: A club: O greatness, God commands you to gather, and the bones made some of them flourish some of them, until the bones of God: O bones, God commands you to be happy with me They say: “Glory be to you, our Lord, and your praise, there is no god but you,“ Then they returned to their villages after their life, and it was that they died in the face After that according to their deadlines.The second narration: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: The angel of Malak is the sons of the children of the matter of his assumption of fighting, so they feared the fighting and said to the king: To them in the epidemic, so we do not go to it until that the epidemic goes away, so God Almighty has exalted them with their families, and they remained eight days until they were not.Their death, so they came out of their burial, so they miraculously from their many, so they prohibited them with the luck, so God after the eighty, then the eighty of you The teeth and the rest of that in their children to this day, and those who say this saying by saying that the Almighty is the one who is the one who is the one who has been killed in the sake of God.] And the third novel: that the Prophet, peace be upon him, delegated his people to jihad, so they thought and they have, so God sent upon them the death, so they did not Their current is a crime of death, and when he saw that he said: O God, God is Jacob and God is Moses, you see the disobedience of your servants, so they will be given to them.Your estimation, and that they do not come out of your arrest, so God sent upon them the death, then he is upon him, peace be upon him.God Almighty.As for the saying of the Exalted: They are woven, and they say: The first: that what is meant by the two ransoms, and they were different in the exaggeration (P-139) their number, and the one said: Without three thousand, nor above the seventy thousand, and the face from where the memorization is that their number is more than ten thousand, because the thousands are the collection of many, and it is not said.Auvian.And the second saying: that the people collect thousands of people as a bit and a sitting, and sitting and sitting, and the meaning is that they were the two hearts of the hearts, the judge said: A great lot that benefits more adopting in their condition, because the death of a great collection is a single payment that does not agree.The flowers of death on a people between them are contradictory and love, such as its flowers and between them, disagreement that the face of the advertisement does not change or disperse.This question can be answered by that what is meant is that each one of them is a thousand for his life, with a love for this worldly worldly, so he returns to the one who said: People are keen on life [Al -Baqarah: 96] Then they are with the end of their love for life and their familiarity with them, God Almighty died and their family, so that he knows that the human being is not.From the death, this saying is on this face, not in the end of the distance.As for his saying: the warning of the death is an advice; Because it is an effective for him, that is, the warning of the death, and it is known that every one warns the death, so

of the Exalted: God said to them, they will die in interpretation (God said) and Jahan: The first: that he is a pilgrimage, his saying: We say to us, if we say that we will not say anything So it is [Al -Nahl: 40] and it was presented that it is not what is meant by the proof of a saying, but what is meant is that it is the Almighty when he wanted to fall from other than the one who is forbidden, and like this, and this is a good thing The language, and his saying indicates: (Then revive them), then if the greeting is valid by saying, then the saying in the death.And the second saying: He is the Heave of the Messenger to say to them: they die, and to say at the living what we have narrated from the Sadd The first is close to investigating.* * * As for his words, he said: (Then I revive them), then he has questions: the first question: the verse is indicative of that he is up to them, after that they died, and he is obligated to the cut It is permissible, and the truthful is about his struggle, so the piece is obligatory with its struggle, but the place; Because the parts are installed on the special form, it is possible, otherwise it is not found first, and the conversion of
