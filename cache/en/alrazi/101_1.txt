The Quranic researcher (P-67) (Surah Al-Qariya) is one of the tenth of the angels ﷽ Qariya, what is the Qariya, and I do not realize what the Qaraa knows that it is the one who is glorified and exalted when the seed is the one With his saying: Their Lord is with them a day for an expert, as it was said: What is that day?It was said: It is the Qariya.﷽ The Quarter is what is the qa’a, and I do not realize what the qarah knows that it contains issues: the first question: the part of the beating with a strictness and a bond, then the germination was called from the germination Qarbah, God Almighty said: Those who disbelieve are still afflicting them with what they made a bishop.And they were bought: they are confused with the Siouf, and they agreed on the fact that the Quarter is a name of the names of the resurrection, and they differed in the water of this name on the authority of it: Which the cells die: Because in the first shouting, the minds go, he said: So he was stunned by those in the heavens and from the earth [Al -Zumar: 68].God dies and then revives him, so he blows the third and they will stand up.It was narrated that the images have a dump on the number of the mother for each one, known as a known one, so God revives every body with that of the bound, from the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who connects to it, And who is affirmed by this face is the Almighty saying: What they look is only a single shouting [Yass: 49], but it is a single dirt [Al -Nidaat: 13] and the second: that the arms of al -Alawiya They are stained by a severe time when the world is devoted, because of that part of that was called the day of resurrection by the part.And the third: that the Quarter is the one that raises the people with the pillow and the mockery, and that is in the heavens with tears and breakfast, and in the sun and the moon with the conflict, and in the jaws, and in the jaws With your children and the regret, and in the land with the kindness and the domination, which is the saying of the dog.And its elevation: that it raises the sake of God with torment, treacherous and cracked, and it is a saying of a fighter.Then they are safe.[Ants: 89] The second question: In expressing his saying: The Qaraa is what the qa’a is a face: one of it: that it warns and the warning came with the lifeshus and the seen, the lion, It is permissible to raise and share.And the second: in which there is a gossip, that is, the Quarter will bring you to what I have told about it in his saying: if it is stung in what is in the graves.[Al -Adiyat: 9] And the third: Raed with the appetite and its informing: What is the qa’ah and the saying of the news of the news: What do you realize what the qa`qah is, then it is said: If you are told about something It is beneficial from it with an increased knowledge, and its saying: I do not realize that it benefits his being ignorant of it, so how is it reasonable that this is a news?We said: We have received this news that is increased: Because we thought that it was a bishop, such as the boats, with this ignorance of our knowledge that it is a bishop that exceeded the boats in the horror and intensity.The third question: its saying: What do you realize what the qarah is in which there are faces: one of it: it is not aware of it, because it is in the severity, and it is not the same, and it is not the same, and it is not the same, and it is not the same, because it is not.And how you appreciated it, it is greater than your estimation, as if it was the Almighty, he said: The bouquets of the world are on the side of that Quarter, as if it is not in the rituals of the fire, as if the fire is in the fire of the fire A light, and for that he said in the last of the surah: a protective fire that alerts it that the fire of the world is on the side of that, which is not with a protector, and the last of the surah has become a custodian of the first.If it was said: Here he said: I don’t realize what is the qarah and said in the last of the Surah: His mother is an amateur and I do not realize what he is and did not say: What do you think of what is an amateur, so what is the difference?We said: The difference is that its universe is a good thing, but its being is an amateur, so it is not like that, so the difference appeared between the two people.And the second: that detailing is not a way to one of the knowledge of it except with the people of God and his two people: because he is searching for the fall of the lords, and there is no way to the duty of the obligations Indeed, with hearing.The following question: The counterpart of this verse is its saying: the right is what the right is and what you realize what the right is [Al-Haqaqa: 1-3] Then the investigators said: His saying: the Qarb His saying: The right is what the right is because the descent is the last and it is necessary to be informed: because the intended is the increase in the an alarm, and this is the leadership, and it is not strong, and it is not By looking at the meaning, the right is more severe for its being back to the meaning of justice, and the severity is more severe because it attaches to the hearts with the permit.
