The Quranic researcher is the fifth door in the interpretation of the Fateh Sura Praise, praise, and thank you, so we say: The difference between the praise and the praise is from its face Well or a sapphire in the end of goodness, so he might praise her, and it is impossible to praise her, so she has proven that praise is better than Hamid.The second face in the difference: that praise may be before charity and may be after him, but praise is only after charity.The third face in the difference: that the praise may be from it, and peace and blessings be upon him said: Related, he said ﷺ: (P-179) “Whoever does not praise people, God does not regenerate.” The loyal face: that praise is a phrase from the saying that is indicative of its void, in particular, with a variety of types With a certainty, which is the virtue of the year and the charity.She fixed what we mentioned that praise is better than praise.As for the difference between the praise and between the thank you, it is that the praise is generally that it is that of that year to you or otherwise If you know this, then we say: We have mentioned that the praise is a neighborhood and the other neighborhood, and the deceased act A fictional effective, but when he said: Praise be to God, it is consequences for his choice, so he said: Praise be to God, it is indicated by this one of the words of this one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who says In the same way, as the philosopher says, but it is a fictional actor, and also, he said: Praise be to God, the first of his saying: Thank God; Because his saying: Praise be to God, praise be upon God, because of every year that was issued from him and prayed to others, and the thank you to God is a praise of the cause of God, and there is no reason for the one who is the same better; Because the estimation is as if the servant says: Whether you give me or do not give me, then you will be blessed and pray to all the two worlds, and you are worthy of the praise, and the great God is from the calamity, and thank you for what was given from the blindness.If it was said: the grace in giving is more than the blessing in paying the calamity, so why did the most leaving the least and mentioned the least?We said in it: the first: the first: as if he says: I am grateful to the lowest blessings, so how are they for the highest.The second: The prohibition is not deadly, and the giving is dead, so the appetite was thanks to the payment of the calamity, which is not endowed.The third: that the payment of the war is more important than the ribs of goodness; So, this is presented.The second one: it is the high He says: Ahm Allah, but he said: Praise be to God and this is the second phrase.Lojoh: One of it: that if he said: Ahm Allah, he benefited from that, if that is the one who said that he is able to praise him Praise the Hamid and before the thanks of the complainants, so whether they are praise or not, they did not praise, and whether they thank you or did not thank you, then it is the highest The valuable and the ancient words.And the second: that our praise is to God, meaning that praise and praise is a right for God and His king, for he is the Almighty who deserves to the praise, because of the many kinds of people.And our saying: Praise be to God, meaning that praise be to God is a right that he deserves for his self, and if he said: God is the rest of God, and this is not indicated by the whole, for the sake of it.It is known that the referral referred to his being is due to praise, and it is more important to the memorial that one person is one of his praise.And the third of it: that if he said: Ahmad, God has been praised, but there is no praise that is worthy of it, and if he said: Praise be to God, then he said: Who am I even?But it is Hamid with all Hamid al -Hamid, for example, if you were asked: Is there a blessing for you?If you say: Yes, then I have been straightened, but a weak red, and if you said in the answer: Rather, his blessing on all the caliphs, then I have been praised by the mother.And it is upset: that the praise is a phrase for the adjective of the heart, and it is a criticism of that of the Hamid, who is preferable With his saying: Ahmad, with God, with his heart, he was unaware of the meaning of glorification, which is appropriate for God, it was false; Because he was told about his soul, he is Hamid with that he is not like that, but if he said: Praise be to God, whether he was unaware or broken, so he is not.Because it is meaning that praise is a right for God and his king, and this meaning is whether the servant was occupied in the sense of glorification and abuse, or if it is not, then it is that it is, so it is that it is, so it is, then it is, so it is, so it is, so it is, then it is the (P-180) He said: I am the most truly of God, and his counterpart is our saying: There is no god but God, for he does not enter the denying, with the difference of our saying: Because he may be a liar in his saying: I bear witness; And for this, the Almighty said in the denying the hypocrites: God testifies that the hypocrites are liars [the hypocrites: 1].His saying: There is no god but God.The third one: the blame in its saying: the praise of God, it is a lot of faces: one of them: the one who is the one who is the one who says: the glorious of the mare.And the second: the king is like your saying: the house is for Zaid.And the third: the ability and the seizure, as your saying: the country is for the merit, and the blame is in your saying: Praise be to God.This is the three faces, if you carry it on the long -standing, then it is known that it is not the praise of it except for it for the absence of its majesty, and it is a lot of it On the king, it is known that it is the highest money for all, so it is obligatory to possess from them as their being, who are working with his praise, and if you carry it on the sake of the righteousness like that; Because it is a duty for itself, and what is possible is possible for itself, and the duty of itself is a lord of the subject of its own, for the praise of God in the sense that the praise is that there is no His king and his king, and in the sense that he is the one who takes over all of the people.The fabrication: His saying: Praise be to God, the eight of the righteousness, and the doors of paradise are eighty, so whoever said this eighty about the custodian of his heart.Fifth Fifth: Praise be to a single memorial that entered the letter of definition, and in which he said: The first: that if it was preceded by a prestige, it is a precedent Idios; Sold for talking about the scattering.The second saying: It does not benefit the general except that it benefits the essence and the right.If you know this, then say: His saying: Praise be to God, if we say the first saying, he stated that all that was praise and a blessing, then it is God, his truth, and his right, What is only God is that he does not deserve praise and praise at all, and if we say the second saying, it was meaning that what praise is a right of God, and the Lord of God, and the Lord of God.Among the individuals of this wihathical to the other than God, and it has proven to the two sayings that his saying: Praise be to God denies the praise of praise for the other.If it was said: Isn't that the blessing deserves to be praise from the blessing on it, and the professor deserves the praise from the slave, and the one who is the one who deserves to be fulfilled.Peace be upon him: Whoever does not praise the people, God does not praise.We said: Everyone who has been blessed otherwise with grace, so the blessing in the truth is God Almighty; Because if it were not for the height of the creation of that preacher in the heart of that blessing, otherwise it was not provided for that year, and if only the Almighty created that It was on it, and the blessing was enabled it to be of the integrity - when the intelligence obtained that grace, so it has proven that the blessing in the truth is God.* * * The sixth is the sixth: that his saying: Praise be to God, as it is indicated that there is no Hamid except God, so the mind is evidenced by him, and the one of him is the one who is: He creates the call of public in the heart of the blessing that was not blessed.And the second: that everyone who has been blessed with others, then he is asking for that excess; Either reward, or Praise, or communication of a right, or discharge to the soul of the creation of miserliness, and the one who is obedient is not a blessing, so it will not be inhabited by the ritual Glory be to him, and he is complete for himself, and the whole person does not seek the fullness; Because the hall of the hall is a referral, then its gifts were urged and urged, so there was no generosity, it was due to the Hamid, so it was proven (P-181) Come here.And the third of it: that every blessing is one of the suppliers, and all the places are possible, for it is found to find the truth, either by the ritual, either by the authority of the God is exalted, and this is confirmed by his saying: What is the grace of you, and from God [Al -Nahl: 53] and praise is not meaningless except for the praise of the year No one is worthy of praise except God Almighty.And the one who is sequence: the grace is not complete except when the meeting of three matters: one of them: to be good, and the benefit of the distress is a result of which it is in the way of it A blessed neighborhood that only finds God Almighty.And the second: that the benefit does not be a complete blessing unless it is free from the opponents of the war and the grief, and the sake of the benefits from the vulnerabilities of the circle is only one.And the third of it: that the benefit does not be a complete blessing unless it is safe from the fear of the deduction, and this matter is only obtained from God, if this is proven, then this is the fullness of this God is exalted, so it is obligatory for the full praise except God Almighty, and you have proven that the proofs of the health of the saying of God: Praise be to God.The fabrication: I have known that the praise is a prank of the praise of others because of his being, a prejudiced belief, and the feeling of the human being did not get the feeling of the human being Filtering him with praise and thank you, if you know this, then say: It is obligatory to be the human being, unable There is a lot that does not strengthen the mind of the human being on the ears on it, as he said: If you count the grace of God, do not count it [Ibrahim: 34] and if the human being is forbidden, the human being is forbidden by the person.Thank you and the best of it.The second: that the human being can do the praise of God and his thanks if God appreciates him, the Almighty is upon that praise and thank you, and if he created in his heart, he called for the same On the authority of Al -Awda and Al -Hoa’al, all of that is from God Almighty, so this is not possible to do the thanks of God, except by the authority of a great blessing, Also, thank you, and on this estimation: the servant cannot come with thank you and praise except for the two With him, there is no end to it, and that is referred to, and the one who is based on the referral is referred to, so the human being was a reason for the one who comes from the praise of God and his thank you for what is Thank you, it is not the same as the saying of his tongue: praise be to God; Rather, it is based on the knowledge of the blessing of it, as the blessing is described by the attributes of the fullness and the majesty, and everything that was dangerous in the human beings of the human beings and the majesty, the majesty, the majesty, the majesty, the majesty, the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the majesty, and the good The imagined and the perceived, and if it is also, he will be prevented as the human being, which comes with the praise of God and his thank you and the best of it.The lord: that the preoccupation with praise and the thanks is that it is that the blessing is met with the grace of the one who is blessed with the skepticism Lojoh: One of them: that the blessings of God are many, not limited, so I met her with this single criticism and with this single memorial in the end of the distance.And the second: that whoever believes that his praise and his thank you will be the blessings of God, the Almighty, then he has believed, and this is the meaning of the saying of Al -Wasiti, thank you.And the third of it: that the human being is needed for the cattle of God in himself and in his attributes and in his conditions, and God is the Almighty who is rich in the thanks of the complainants and praise of the Hamid, so how are you Thank you and this praise, so that the servant has proven that the servant is unable to come from the praise of God and his thank you God; Because if he said, God bless them, he has assigned them what they have no energy for him, but when he said: Praise be to God, the meaning was that the honor of praise is his right and the king of God They did not appreciate (P-182) on it; And it was said that peace be upon him, said: O Lord, how do you thank you and thank you for you only with your intention to me, and it is that you agree with me for that thank you?And he said: O Dawood, when you taught you, you will be rewarded for my thanks, so you thank you according to your ability and your energy.The eighth: On the authority of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: “If God blesses His servant with a blessing, then the servant says: Praise be to God, and God will say to God: I gave him what I have no destiny, so I have no value for him.He was thirsty, and he saw it, or was nudity, and he was covered, but if the servant said: Praise be to God, it was meaning that every praise came with him, one of the Hamid, then it is for him, and it is for him Among the praiseworthy people and I can enter the mind in the presence of God, and it is for God, and that enters in it all the Hamid, whom it is mentioned in it.The heavens, and the whole of the Hamid that all the prophets mentioned from Adam to Muhammad God is upon them, and all the restrictions that all the first and the scholars mentioned, and all creation and all the Mahamid who will mention it to the time of their saying: O God, and give them peace in them, and the last of them is to call them that praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Yunus: 10] Then all of this resurrection is careful.They will come to them, forever, and the ears of the two heads, for all of these sections that are not endowed within them within the saying of the servant: the praise of God, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord."Look at my servant, I have given him a single grace that has no destiny, so I gave me a thank you for what is not limited to him." I say: Here is an other distress, which is that the blessings of God be upon the servant in the world is dirty, and his saying: Praise be to God, praise be to God, and it is not forbidden, and it is not dead.From him the one who is the rest of the remaining is other than his death, as if he is the Almighty saying: My servant, if you say: Praise be to God in the interview of that grace, then the one who remains for you is from you, So it is imperative that it be met with an uninterrupted blessing; For this reason, the servant deserves the innovative reward and the goodness of Saddi, so you have proven that the saying of the servant to God obliges goods that are not last and not for them.* * * The ninth is the ninth: There is no doubt that the existence is better than the numbers, and the evidence is that it is that all the existence is alive.It is not like that, and if this is proven, then the existence of everything is possible, and only God Almighty, then he has obtained the creation of God and his goodness, his virtue, and his goodness, She proven that there is no existence in the world of the souls, the bodies, the highs, and the signs, except for God, and peace, mercy, and goodness, and the mercy, and the goodness, If the servant said: Praise be to God, then he will not want him: praise be to God for the blessed blessings to me, but the meant Everything that he has, if the servant said: Praise be to God, it was with it: praise be to God on his mind on every creature that created it, and on all the modern ones, the most modern, And a move, a throne, a chair, a garden, a human, a self, a lobby, a body, and a presentation, to the forefathers and the eternity of the heads, and I bear witness that it is your family and your right It has a polytheism and a ritual.The adore: for a saying that he says: praise is presented to the timid; Because it is said: Glory be to God and praise be to God, so what is the reason for this in the beginning of the beginning with the timid?The answer is that the praise refers to praise the connotation of guarantee, because praise indicates its uniformity His self and his attributes of discords and pests, and the timed indicates that this row is on the authority of it (P-183), good to the creation, with the blessing of them.The praise is a sign of its complete transcendence, and the timed indicates its exaltation above the completion; For this reason, the appetite was the first, and this direction is beneficial from the ruler's ruler Well done by worshipers, unless he is a scholar of all information, to know the types of needs of worshipers, otherwise if he is able to be able to do all the estimates, he will be able to do so, so that they will be able to do so He was rich in all the needs, if he was not like that, he would be associated with paying the need for himself, he would prevent him from paying the need of the servant, so he did not He only takes place after his universe from discord and pests, so she proven that the appeal by his saying: Praise be to God, the first of God: The hard -working one is the same: praise be to God, he has to be attached to the past and relates to the future, but his attachment to the past is that he sits on the righteousness, His attachment to the future, so it is that it is necessary to renew the blessings in the future time; For his words, the Exalted: If you thank you, I will increase you [Ibrahim: 7] and the mind also indicates it, which is that the precedent blessings requires the feet of the servant of the servant, if the servant of the servant is the one who does not perform Thank you for the mind and the heart, the gates of the blessings of God Almighty, and the doors of his knowledge and his love, and that is one of the great blessings; For this meaning, praise was the reason for his attachment to the past, closing the gates of the fire, and due to his attachment to the future, he will open up to you, and the gates of the chapters are in The gates of the hijab from God Almighty; And the influence of it in the future, and the doors of the knowledge of God are opened, and when it was not an end to the degrees of God, therefore, there is no end to the servant in the knowledge Except our saying: Praise be to God; For this reason, the Surah Al -Hamid was called in the Fateh Surah.The second one is twenty: the praise of God is a generous word of the word How do you have to be obedient?He said: I have been thirty years ago.So how is that?He said: The burning fell in Baghdad, and the shops were burned and the role, so they told me that my shop did not burn, so I said: Praise be to God, and I was with me that I was happy.The people of the people, and the right of religion and the tranquility was not to rejoice in that, for I am in forgiveness for thirty years from my saying: Praise be to God With this, this word, even if it is the extent of the destiny, is that it is obligatory to take care of its position, then the blessings of God on the servant are many, except that it is the first In two types: the blessings of the world, the blessing of religion, and the blessings of religion are better than the blessings of the world; There are many wings, and our saying: Praise be to God, a pure, honorable word, so the sane person must be given this word to mention it in the absence It is obligatory only to mention it with the loser of the blessings of religion, then the blessings of religion are the sects: the wings of the wounds, the houses of hearts, and the second division, the one who is honored, then the one who is the same, then Taraa is considered to be that blessings from where it is a blessing, and a woman who is considered to be the best of the blessing, and the second section is honored, so this is the places Our saying: Praise be to God, in agreement with his position, protecting him.The third third is the first: the first word that was mentioned by us, Adam is his saying: praise be to God, and the last word that the people of Paradise are mentioned is the saying Because when he reached the soul to his secret, he sneezed, and he said: Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, and the second is the saying of the Almighty: and the last of the Lord of the Lord is the Lord.The openness of the world is a building on the praise (P-184) and its conclusion is a building on the praise, so you will strive until the first of your work and the last of it is the one who is in the past A human being is a small world, so it is necessary for his conditions to be agreed upon for the great world.The fourth of the fourth: among the people who said: the ability of the words: they said: Praise be to God, and this is a weak; Because the guarantee is that it is valid for the words, and this guarantee requires the corruption of the words and which is indicated by his face Really for him and his property, and this is complete words in himself, so there is no need to add.The second: that his saying: Praise be to God, it is indicated by his vastness, which is due to praise, according to himself and according to his actions, whether they were praise or not to him, or he did not.Because what is the same is higher and more than.The third: they mentioned a question in the risks, which is that it does not want the child to say to his son: He works as such and such; Because it is permissible that he does not exceed his matter, then he is sinful, but he says: So, and so must be done, then if the child is generous, then he answers and obeyed him, and if he is disturbed, if he is disturbed, if he is disturbed, if he is disturbed, if he is a disturbing In response, then his sin is less, so there is a lower one of us.* * * Fifth Fifth: Touching Jabriya and Al -Qadriya with his saying: Praise be to God; As for Jabriya, they have been held by it from his face The righteous is higher and more preferred, it was more worthy of praise, and there is no doubt that the honor of the creatures is faith, and if faith was a verb for the servant of the servant, then the slave would be Praise be to Him, and for the sake of the investigation of God, and when we did not know that faith was obtained with the creation of God, not the creation of the servant.The second: The nation gathered on their saying: Praise be to God for the grace of faith, if faith was a verb for the servant and what was a verb to God for God: The grace of faith is void, for if the act of the actor does not be a verb with a rugged false; To say it to the Almighty: They love to be praised by what they did not do [Al -Imran: 188].The third: We have indicated that he said: Praise be to God, his appearance indicates that all praise be to God, and that it is not for the other If all the blessings of God, and faith is more preferred for blessings, then faith should be from God.The lord: that his saying: Praise be to God, a praise of it for itself, and the praise of the soul is ugly in what is between the creation, so when his book began with the same With the difference in the state of creation, and that it is good from God, what is erased from creation, and that indicates that it is an obstacle that is measured by its actions on the verbs of the creation of creation.The servants do not ugly those things from God Almighty, and this is the lead of the domestication of the whole of the kidneys.And the fifth: that when the transgressor does it must be good, and it must have an increase in the goodness of the good, or if it is in the good It is referred, and the increase is on the good, either to be a duty, or that it is in the matter of preference: As for the duty, it is the same as the delivery of reward and modes to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from The preference is the same as that it increases the amount of duty on the path of charity, so we say: This is a praise in his virtue of the exalted, attached to the validity of us, Praise be to God, and his report is to say: As for the performance of the obligations, it does not benefit the verge of praise, not to see that whoever has it is a debt of his debt Praise be to God, if this is a verb, he would have been saved from the defamation, and it is not required to deserve it to Hamid, and the act of the preference is that it is the good It is beneficial to that more praise; Because if he did not come from that act, he would not have this praise, and if he was like that, he was incomplete for his self -associated, and he is not so Aid to Hamid (P-185) and praise.Sixth: His saying: Praise be to God, it indicates that he is a burden, so he said: His entitlement to praise and praise is either that he is a hardship for him, or for him, for him, for him, for him, for him.If the first was the first Something for the verb is required to make the praise; Because what has been proven to itself, he prevented his confirmation of others, and also prevented something from the verbs required of him to fulfill the defamation; Because what has been proven to his self is forbidden to reiterate it because of his others, and if he was like that, he did not decide in his right to exalt Of the clouds and rewards, and that is the lead of the dignity, and the second division - which is that the straightening of praise be to God is not for Him for Him - It is a deficiency for his self -associated, and that is, and that is referred to God.Because those who are eligible for praise be to be released, he is the one who is not in his action, nor a portion in his judiciary, and there is no injustice in his rulings, and for us that God is the same To the great of the al -Muhamid and al -Jaeh, as for the Gabriya of Jabriyah, there is no ugliness except when it is his action, and there is no portion except when it is ruling, and there is no sacrifice except when it is its creatures; Because he creates infidels in the infidel and then tortures him, and he gives up the tales without compensating them, so how is it possible for this to be able to do so.For praise?Also, that praise that God deserves to be attached to the gods of divinity, either that he deserves it on the servant, or on himself, if the first is the first The verb, and that is the saying of the mighty, and if the second was with it that God must be praised by his soul, and that is a falsehood, so they said: It is only valid for our saying.The sixth of the sixth: they disagreed that the greetings are fixed with the mind or by hearing; Among the people who said: It is fixed with hearing; To say it to the Almighty: We were not tormented until we sent a messenger [Al -Israa: 15] and his saying is the Almighty: a messenger who is missionaries and those who are not blessed, for the sake A pilgrimage after the messenger [Women: 165] and among them who said: It is fixed before the coming of the law and after his coming on divorce, and the evidence is upon him: Wahwah: The first: that his saying: Praise be to God indicates that this praise is his right and his king on divorce, and that indicates that this is the evidence of this.The second: He is upset, he said: Praise be to God, Lord of the two worlds, and you have proven in the origins of jurisprudence to repeat the judgment on the description of the appropriateness that indicates that of that The description, so we have proven praise for itself, and described himself with his being, the Lord of the Lord, for the two worlds, peace be upon them, with their money, for the sake of their money.This indicates that the straightening of Hamid only obtains an adult to them as a merciful, mercy, and if it is, then it is proven that The entitlement of Hamid is a steadfastness for God Almighty in all of the facts, whether before the coming of the Prophet or after him.The one who is tenth is ten: We must search for the truth of Hamid and what it is.Because our saying: Praise be to God is a news about the praise of Hamid, and the news about the thing is a deficient for the one who is informed of it, so it is necessary for you to be the best of God.For God, so we say: Hamid al -Muamaa is a phrase of every act that feels the greatness of the blessing because of its inhabitants.And that action is either that it is the verb of the heart, or the verb of the tongue, or the verb of the wounds, but the act of the heart is that it is imitated in it in it as the one in it.And the core, and the verb of the tongue is to remember a sign of the verge of his eyes, as a matter That is the blessing of the thieves of the fullness and the glory.They said: It is not permissible for God to command his servants to praise Him, and beg on him with his faces: The first: that this is the timid, either, and there is no one, and it is a blessing.Ali, the first is invalid; Because this requires that he is the highest of them asking for a reward and reward, and that is praise in the fullness of the generosity, for the generosity if it is not blessed, then the reward is not required For the other one, and that is obligatory.The second: They said: Exaggeration with this praise is tired of the Hamid and other than the benefit of the Hamid; Because it is complete for itself and the whole of itself, it is that it is completely completed by it, so it has proven that the preoccupation with this tattoo is a messenger and a freedom, so there is no reason.The third: that the meaning of the positive is that if he did not do the punishment, then the affirmation of the praise of God is up to the Almighty that he said: If you did not do so, this is not that of this We benefit him in the truth of God, so it was meaning that this action is not excessive in it for anyone, and if he left it, I will punish you, and this is not done.The second partner: They said: Exaggeration in the praise of God is bad literature from his faces: The first: that he runs a course of conjunction of the charity of God with that little thanks.The second: that the preoccupation with thanks is only with the convergence of those blessings in the heart and the stomach of the heart with the blessings that prevents it from the exodus in the knowledge.The third: that praise for God is up to the affliction of the blessing indicates that it praised him for the sake of the win And praise and the good praise of that blessings, and this man is in the truth Its worshipers and its demanding, but it is that grace and the luck of the soul, and that is a place of descent, and God knows.* * * The second chapter in the interpretation of his saying: the Lord of the two worlds, and in which there are the benefits of the first one: know that the supply is either that it is a duty of its own For itself, as for the duty of itself, God is the Almighty only, and the place for itself is all that is only God Almighty and He is the world; Because the speakers said: The world is all the existence of God, and the reason for the name of this division is the world that the existence of everything except God is the same It was called all the fences, except God, that it is a world.إذا عَرَفْتَ هَذا فَنَقُولُ: كُلُّ ما سِوى اللَّهِ تَعالى إمّا أنْ يَكُونَ مُتَحَيِّزًا, وإمّا أنْ يَكُونَ صِفَةً لِلْمُتَحَيِّزِ, وإمّا أنْ لا يَكُونَ مُتَحَيِّزًا, ولا صِفَةَ لِلْمُتَحَيِّزِ, This is three sections: the first division: It is either that it is a metaphor for the division, or it is not, if it is a metaphor for the division, then it is the same The individual jewel; As for the body, it is that it is from the upper bodies or from the lower bodies; As for the high bodies, they are the fruits and the heels, and they have been established by the end of the other things other than these two divisions, like the throne, the chair, and the Sadir, Heaven, and the lower bodies are either a ritual or a compound: as for the seed, it is the four elements: one of them: the land of the land in what is in it.And the second: the water of the water, which is the surrounding sea, and this is the greater sailor, which is in this way, and what is in the great affection that does not know.And the third: the air of the air.And the sequence of it: the fire of the fire.As for the rich bodies, they are the plant, the hostility, and the animal, on the many of their sections and the adoption of their types.As for the second section - the place that is a characteristic of the consequences - it is symptoms, and those who are spoken are mentioned by the four sexes of the symptoms.As for the third - which is the subject that is not a bias or a description of the consequence - it is (P -187) the souls, and it is either a lower, or the high: Ginning, or a breastfeeding shira, which is the plight of demons.The high aspects are either attached to the bodies, which are the kingdoms, or otherwise related to the bodies, which are the purified aspects of the sacred, for this is the sign of the sign.The world, and if the human being wrote a thousand thousand generated in the explanation of these sections, what happened to the least arranged of these sections, except that when it is proven that it is the one who has been proven One, it has been proven that all that it is possible for itself, so it is needed in its existence to find the duty For itself, and also it has proven that the place is the case of its survival, it does not take advantage of the remainder, and God Almighty has the God of the two worlds from where he is the one who brought it out to the one who is from the He is the one who keeps it as long as it is.And if you know that, there is a little thing for you, the interpretation of his saying: Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, and everyone who was more surrounded by the most important of the three of the three of the three of these is On the interpretation of his saying: Lord of the two worlds.The second one: the educator on two sections, one of them: to educate anything to be profitable to him, and the second: to educate him to be profitable, and the Lord is blessed The first section; Because they are raised by others to make it either a reward or praise, and the second division is the right to Glory to it, as he said: I created you, so that they would not be blessed, and they are not for you.It is raised and improved, and it is the disagreement of the path of the educated and the difference of the good.And he knows that his rabies are a violation of the rability of others, and his two sides: The first: What we mentioned is that he is raised by his servants, not for the sake of the sake And others are raised for the sake of themselves, not for the sake of others.The second: that if it is raised, then that is the estate of that education, the deficiency appears in his shame and in his money, and it is a transcendent of the deficiency and the harm, as he said, as he said: His shame, and what we descend, except with a known amount [Al -Hijr: 21].The third: that others are from the good, if the poor insisted on him, he hated him, forbidden, and forbidden, and the right is exalted with the disagreement of that, as he said: “The prayers and peace be upon him:“ Supplication." The lord: that otherwise from the good are not required of charity, it was not given, but the right is exalted, it is given before the question, you see that it is your Lord in the case You were not ignorant of a sane, do not improve it to ask him, and you will protect you and improve to you with the fact that you did not ask you, and I had no mind or guidance.Fifth: that other people are from the good, its charity is cut off either by poverty, absence or death, and the right is up to the right that does not cut its charity.The sixth: that others are from the good, the charity of it with a people without a people, and it is not possible to perish.And my mercy and all anything sought [Al -A'raf: 156], so I stated that he was the Lord of the two worlds, and is good to the cells all; For this, the Almighty said in the right of himself: praise be to God, Lord of the two worlds.The third is: that the one who praises, praises and exalted in the world, but it is like that for one of the four faces: either for its complete form in itself in the same in itself Surveys and pests, even if it is not good for you.Either To make him good to you and bless you.Either because you hope that his kindness is to you in the future of time.Either for the sake of being a disagreement from his abundance, his ability, and the fullness of his surgery, for these cases are the flaws that are obligatory to exalt, as if it is the one who says: مِمَّنْ يُعَظِّمُونَ الكَمالَ الذّاتِيَّ فاحْمَدُونِي فَإنِّي إلَهُ العالَمِينَ, وهو المُرادُ مِن قَوْلِهِ: الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ, وإنْ كُنْتُمْ مِمَّنْ تُعَظِّمُونَ الإحْسانَ فَأنا رَبُّ العالَمِينَ, وإنْ You were glorified to the gathering in the future, so I (P-188), the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.The luxurious one: the faces of God for the servant of the servant, many, uninterrupted, and we remember from it a proverb: the first example: when the father of the father of the father To the mercy of the mother, how to see that it became a first relationship, then a second chewing, then it was born from it, different members, such as the bones, the cartilage, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords, the lords And the partners, then the bit of some communicated, then it was obtained in each one of them a special type of powers, so the power is in the eye, and in the eye, and the one in the eye, and the one in the eye, and the one in the eye, and the name in the eyes The tongue, they were granted to those who heard with greatness, and he started with a fatigue, and he fell with meat.He knew that the book of the preacher of the body of the human being is a famous, and that is indicated by the rabies of God Almighty for the servant.The second example: that the single love, if it is located in the land, then if the end of the land is reached to it, it was blown and did not breathe from anything from the sides, except from the highest and the lifetime of it.All sides: As for the upper slit, the part of the tree comes out of it.As for the lower slit, it comes out of the seed part of the earth, which is the veins of the tree.Many branches, and then the lights appear on those lights first, then the fruits are second, and the fruits of these are different parts of the thickness of the thickness, the thickness of the thickness, which is the thickness of the thickness, the thickness of the thickness, the thickness of the thickness, the thickness of the thickness, the thickness of the thickness, the thickness of the past, The paint, and the absent part of the tree is that these veins are ended to their parts; And those parties are in the kindness, as if it is a sophisticated water, and with the end of its kindness, it is divided into the rough and the roughness, and it is called the God in it.The gentle parts of the clay to itself, and the wisdom in all of these tannings are to obtain what the servant needs from the food, the perpetuation, the frozen, and the elderly, and the elderly We poured water in the morning, then the earth was slit down [Abs: 25, 26] The verses.The third example: that he put the orbits and the makers, where they became the reasons for obtaining the interests of worshipers, so the night created to be a reason for comfort, and the silence The day is to be a reason for the pension and the movement is the one who made the sun a light and the moon is a light, and it is destined for the homes so that you can learn the number of years and the account: With the truth, and it is the one who made you the stars to guide them in the darkness of righteousness and sea [Al -Anam: 97] and read his saying: Did we not make the earth to be a majestic - 7], Know that if you contemplate the wonders of the conditions of hostility, plants, and animals, and the effects of the wisdom of the mercy in the creation of the human being, the sacrifice of your mind has ruled that the reason is that Its mercy is a flaw, and when you show you a country from the sailors of the secrets of his saying: Praise be to God, the Lord of the World.Fifth Fifth: He added praise to himself, and he said: Praise be to God, then he added himself to the two worlds, and the ability: I love the praise, so we will be.He was a king, and then when I mentioned myself, I knew myself that I am a Lord to the world It indicates that his being is a Lord for the two worlds, the full attributes, and the matter is like that; Because I complete the perpetrators to be complete, and above the completion, then he said: God is indicative of his being, and he is required to provide him with himself in himself and his self, and he is the one who says: It is meaning that all that it is excessive is excessive from his education, his goodness, and his presence, and it is what is meant by our saying that it is above the perpetrator.The sixth is the sixth: that he possesses worshipers other than you, as he said: And what the soldiers of your Lord know is only [Al -Muddathir: 31] and you do not have a Lord for you, and then he is the Lord, then he is the Lord, then he is the Lord, then he is the Lord, then he is the Lord, then he is, then he is, then he is the Lord, and then he is, and then he is the Lord, then he is the Lord, then he is, and then he is the Lord, then he is, and then You are, and you serve him as if you have a Lord other than him, so what is good for this (P-189) to be educated, is it not that he keeps you in the day from the pest Fear of muddy?He knew that the guards prohibit the king every night, so do they prohibit him from stinging the brutality?And do they proceed to it from the beginnings?As for the right, it is permitted by the pests, and it will protect it from the fear; After that, the first night was visited in the types of prohibitions and the wounds of the forbidden and the ancients, so what is the greatest of this rabting and what is good for them, is it not that The sons of the Lord, are full of those who destroy the sons of the Lord.For this meaning, the Almighty said: Say: Whoever gives you the night and the day from the mercy [Al -Anbiya: 42] that is only the king of the mighty, the one who is the one, and the heart of the heart, Ador and secrets.The fabrication: Al -Qadriyah said: It is a Lord to be a Lord for the two worlds and an educator for them, even if it was good to them, a heat of those who are for them.He is tormented by him; He commands faith and then prevents it From him, he was not a Lord or a educator, but he was harmful and harmful, and Al -Jabriya said: He will be a Lord and an educator, even if the grace was shocked by him His mercy, and when faith was the greatest and time to it, it must be obtained from God Almighty; To be a Lord for the two scientists to them, good with the creation of faith in them.The eighth: Our saying, “God is honored by our saying,” the Lord of what we have shown in that with many wings in the interpretation of the names of God, and then the one who says: Lord, O Lord, and the reason in which the joke and the wages are mentioned in the interpretation of the names of God, so we do not restore it.* * * The third chapter in the interpretation of its saying: The Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, and in which the first good is the one: the mercy: it is the blessing with what is not the one who is not the ritual And the Most Merciful: It is the blessing with what is perceived by his gender from worshipers, he was told by Abraham Bin Adham that he said: I was a guest of the people of the people, so the people of the people, so the people, and the people, so He was loosened, so I followed him, so he went down in some hills, and if he is with a tight man who is tightened, the hands, so the westernism is that of that loaf on the face of it.It was narrated on the authority of Dhu al -Nun that he said: I was in the house when I fell asleep in my heart, and I became in terms of what I had my soul, so I got out of the house and ended up to the house, Strongly, so he followed it, so he reached the Nile, so I saw a frog that stood on the outskirts of the valley, and the estate was attached to the back of the frog and the frog and the frog and the frog and the frog and the frog and the frog and the frog And go, and I rode the ship and followed it, so the frog was called to the other side of the Nile, and the estate descended from its back, and it took a young man, so it is a young man, so it is a young man Under a tree, and I saw the one who intends to repeat it, so when I approached the one from that young man, the satellite arrived to the mouth, and the satellite tried to the one who touched him, and he touched him, With the human being, the human being from them.It is said that the son of the crow as it comes out of the peeling of the egg is removed from the feathers, so it will be as if it is a piece of flesh of red The mosquitoes are gathered on it because it resembles a piece of dead flesh, so if the mosquitoes reach the ritualization of those mosquitoes, and it will be lost, and it is still up to it, and it is still up to it, and it is still on it.His feathers and his flesh is hidden under his feathers, so that his mother returns to him, and for this reason he came in the claim of the Arab The ideal is that the grace of God is general, and his charity is complete, and his mercy is wide.(P-190) Know that the tester is on two sections: from it what it thinks is a mercy with it that it is not like that, but rather it is in the truth, and it is a torment, and it is a torment, and it is a torment, And a standing, with the fact that it is in the truth Fadl, charity and mercy.As for the first section: the child, if his son is accustomed to doing what he does and does not discipline him and does not carry him on learning, then this is in the phenomenon of mercy and in the interior.As for the second division, such as the child, if his son is loved in the book and carried it on learning, then this is in the apparent resurrection, and in the truth, a mercy, and then the human being is in the man That hand was cut off, so this is a torment, and in the inner is a rest and mercy, for the father is deceived by the fools, and the sane looks at the stones.If you know this, then all of what is in the world of the world, the beginning, the mother, and the hardship, then it is a torment and the mother in the apparent, except that it is a ruling and the mercy in the truth, If you leave the many good for the sake of a few evil, there is a lot For yourself [Al -Israa: 7] and what is meant by the creation of the fire is the way of the rituals to the elders of the righteous, and its attraction from the house of Al -Farar to the House of Decision, as he said: “Fire to God” [50] The chapter is the story of Moses and the Green on them, peace be upon them, because Moses was building the judgment on the darkness of the affairs, so he denounced the fact that the travel was killed and killed the boy, and the gossip of the gossip, He was building his rulings on the truths and secrets, and he said: As for the shed, it was for the masters of working in the sea, so I wanted to defect it and it was behind them, and it was not behind them.Single, and the boy, his sons were believers, so we feared that they would be overwhelmed with tyrants and disbelief, so we wanted us to replace them with their Lord, and it is a good one of him, and a good one of him, and a blessing of him, For two pharmacists who are in the city, and they were under them, and their father was righteous, so your Lord wanted to exhaust them, and they will be broken by their treasures.In this story, the verb is the one who builds me on the truths, not on the back, so if you see what he hates, your rituals will be repent Hidden secrets and wisdom in the language, and that his wisdom and mercy required that, and when that appears to you an effect from the sailors of the sake of his saying: The second one: Rahman: a special name for God, and the Most Merciful: it is called upon and otherwise.If it was said: He did this merciful greater, so did the lowest remembrance of the highest?And the answer: Because the great great is not required by the right, the right, it was reported that some of them went to some of the oldest, so he said: I came to you, so he said: The misery is a walking man.As if he is up to say: If you were confused about the remembrance of the Most Merciful Great things, I am also merciful; So ask me to stir up and salt your destiny, as he said to Moses: “Moses, peace be upon me, from the salt of your capacity and the fault of your chat.” The third one: He described his soul with his mercy, and he was given a merciful merciful.So that mercy has become a reason for its dialects from the stakes of the fools, then we will be half a day of four and thirty times that it is a mercy The prayers are seven of ten rak'ahs, and the memorization of the “Most Merciful” is read in every two times, once in “in the name of God, the Most Merciful.” God, the Lord of the Merciful, the Most Merciful.These many times the long life is due to the survival of Muslims from fire, shame and destruction?The loyal one is: He is the Most Merciful, because he creates what the servant does not appreciate, and he is merciful, because he does what the servant is not able to do so Mercy, because you are greeted with an excused sperm, so I gave it to you a good image, as he said: And he said: He filmed you, so good for you, and I am good for you.A deficient obedience, so I will give you a pure paradise.Fifth: “It was narrated that a fatwa was brought to his death and he was taken to his tongue from the testimony that there is no god but God, so the Prophet came to him and told him, and he was informed of him, He is subjected to the testimony, and he is obliged to work, and the Prophet said: Did he not pray?And they said: Yes, and peace be upon him: They gave his mother, and she came when she was a curtain, and peace be upon him, so peace be upon him: Eye, and peace be upon him: They gave the whale and the fire, so I said: And what is made by the fire?I forgive him, I am a ninety -year -old God except God.And the joke is that it was Rahmah, and it was not mercy, for the sake of that little destiny from the mercy, what was allowed to be burned with the fire, for the mercy of the merciful.His servants with his care with his worshipers, how can he burn the believer who has been taught to the testimony that there is no god but God for seventy years?The sixth is the sixth: He was defeated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, when his Lords were broken.He said: “Oh God, the guidance of my people, for they do not know.” He appeared that the day of resurrection says: My nation, my nation, for this is a great generosity from him in the world and in the last, but the last, but the last, This charity is for its compassion as a mercy as he said: And we did not send you only a mercy to the two worlds [the prophets: 107], if the one who is the same is the one who is the same Rahim?Also, it was narrated that peace be upon him, he said: “O God, make my nation’s account over my hands.” Then he refrained from praying on the dead, for the sake of the time, Aisha about the house in the causes of dismantling, as if he is up to him, he said to him: You have a single mercy and it is his saying: And we have not sent you only a mercy to the two scholars [107] Surprisingly, so you missed me and my servants, and you will leave me and your nation, for I am the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.It becomes a van, so the crime of all the creation of creation is not destroyed in the seas of my mercy, because I am the Most Merciful.Al -Faddah Al -Saba: Al -Qadriyah said: How to be merciful, merciful, who created the creation of the fire and the torment of forever?How to be merciful, merciful, who creates infidels in the infidel and tortures him?How to be merciful, merciful, who commanded faith, then he replied and prevented him from it?Al -Jabriyah said: Know.
