The researcher of the Quran is up to him: If you are traveling and you did not find a writer of a consecutive vine You conceal the testimony and whoever you hold it, for it is the sinner of his heart, and God is what you do.Know that he is the highest, he made the goods in this verse on three sections: a ban on a book and witnesses, and a sales of a chapter, and the sake of safety, and what is the matter of the sake of the verse.By writing and martyrdom, and know that it may be excused in the travel either that the writer is not found, or if it is found, but the machines of the book are not found, and it is not the same as the remembrance of it The mortgage is the face of the system, and this is the most abolished in the way of writing and martyrdom, and then in the verse: On the travel of several days of other days [Al -Qarra: 184] and its restoration is here.Because it shows the thing and clarifies it, and the travel was called a travel; Because he travels from the morals of the men, that is, he reveals, or because when he came out from the Kena to the Sahrawi, he was revealed to people, or because he was not brought out to the Sahra The house is unclear, and the morning travels if it appears, and the woman travels on its face, that is, I showed it, and I travel from the people, I travel, if it is a sacrifice.And I was traveling, if you were forgotten, and the travel of the sweat, and that is because if you were forgotten, (P-105), you have appeared what was under the dust and travel from the ritual, and it is not the same.The rest of the day after the sunset is a travel for its clarity, and God knows.* * * The second question: the origin of the mortgages from the permanent, it is said: the mortgage of the thing if it lasted and stable, and a stagnant blessing, that is, constantly fixed.If you know the origin of the meaning, then say: the origin of the mortgages is a source, it is said: I prevailed at the man.And my children betrayed him with what I say if you know this, then we say: The sources may be transferred and they will make names and go away from the work of the verb, then he said: It is an injury to the source, but the effect of it is infected with it, as it says: I prevailed at the increase of a garment, and when it was made, the name was made.And he has a gathering: a betting and a bet, and what came on the stages of the east saying: ؎ I did not give it from our children ∗∗∗ their thumbs, so they will be spoiled as someone who has been.Saddah and my soul without her enemy ∗∗∗ and she was closed to her before the struggle and his counterpart.Al -Zajaj: a few acts and action, and the deceased claimed that the mortgage is a betting, then The bet of its collection is a betrayal, so they will be the gathering of collection, and it is like their saying: a fruit and a fruit, and from the people who reflected this, and he said: The mortgage His collection is a bet, and know that when it is normalized, it is not, and it will not be seen, and the collection of collection is not seen, so it is obligatory that it is not said that it is only when it is, but it is the same A phenomenon is a phenomenon, like a thunderbolt, a ram, a scrub, a cup, a gay, a dog and a dog.The third question: Ibn Katheer and Abu Amr (their mortar) read the back and distraction, and it was also narrated from them (their journey) by raising the railway and the ritual of the ram.Abu Amr: I only know the bet in the horses, so I read (their journey) for separation between the bet in the horses and between the gathering of the rak'ah, and the reader of Abu Umar Al -Akhfash said: It is a ugliness, because a act is unanimously agreed upon by a few anomalous, as it is said: a stance and a billener, and the sake of the end, and the last of it.Lonely, limited, simplicity, ritual, and anchor, and an horses and apostasy.The following question: In the verse, it is deleted.He has a prestige, and if our things made it a news and our beginner, and the estimation: the document is a consequence.* * * The fifth question: the jurisprudence agreed today that the mortgages are in travel and presence whether in the event of the existence of the writer and his numbers, and there was a journey that he did not.Taking the back of the verse, and it does not do the saying of it today, but the verse restricts the remembrance of the travel on the way of the majority, as it is not for you, so it is not for you, and it is not for you, and it is not for you.If you fear [the women: 101] (P-106), and the fear is not over the condition of the palace.* * * The prevailing question: the questions of the mortgages are many, and he referred to those who said that the mortgage of the rumor is not permissible that the verse indicated that the mortar is that it is necessary It is indicated that the intended from the mortgages is the right of the owner of the right to prevent the pity, and that is only the arrest and rumors that cannot be The mortgage of the rumor is valid.* * * Then the Almighty said: If some of you are safe, let him perform the one who believes in his safety and knows that this is the third section of the remote goods in the verse, and it is not in the verse, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is mentioned in the verse There is a book and no witnesses, and there is no mortgage in it, and there are issues: the first question: the security of so and so if it is not if it is not immortal of it, he said: “Do you have a sake of it?” His brother [Yusuf: 64] So his saying is that if some of you are safe, that is, he did not hide his betrayal and his halls, so he will not perform the one who believed in his faith in any And he is held in The creditor thought, so he does not succeed his belief in his safety and his right to him, it is said: His faith and his death are safe and accommodated.* * * Then he said: Let God fear His Lord, that is, this debt must fear God and not to be unjust, because the creditors of what he treated is the good treatment, and he is the one who is the one who is the best of his soul.With the trustworthy of writings, martyrdom, and mortgages, and he will be forgotten for this debt that God fears and treat him with good treatment in that this is not denying that of the truth, and that is the truth The term, and in the verse is another saying, which is that it is a speech for their paths that the mortar is performed when the money of the money is the sake of the money, and it is safe in his hand, and the face is the first.The second question: One of the people who said: This verse is a dirt for the signs of advanced significance on the path of writing and martyrdom and taking the mortal, and knowing that the obligation is that Otherwise, a sign of a mistake, but those tames are subjected to guidance and the sponsorship of the past About them, he said: It is not in the verse of the periods of copying, then he said: Do not conceal the testimony and in the interpretation of the faces: Writing, martyrdom, and mortgages when the being of the city is a safe one, and then it was permissible in this city to succeed this thinking, and that he will come out of the treachery of the traitor, It is permissible for some people to be attached to their conditions, for our delegation of God, the Almighty, that man until he seeks in the life of that truth, and that he will testify to the right of the truth.The killing of that testimony, whether the owner of the truth, is the testimony of that testimony, or he did not know and stressed in it that he made him the sinner of the heart, if he left it, and he left it The validity of this interpretation, and it is the saying of “the best of witnesses who witnessed before he was martyred”.The second face: In the interpretation of the intended of the testimony of the testimony that the science is denied by that existence, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: a mother who says: وإسْحاقَ ويَعْقُوبَ والأسْباطَ كانُوا هُودًا أوْ نَصارى قُلْ أأنْتُمْ أعْلَمُ أمِ اللَّهُ ومَن أظْلَمُ [البقرة: 140] والمُرادُ الجُحُودُ وإنْكارُ العِلْمِ.The third direction: in the custody of testimony and abstinence from performing it at the need to its residence, and that was presented in that saying (p-107) and the Shuha'dah does not refuse if it is: [282] Whenever he refrained from establishing testimony, he has seized his right, and he was with the abuse of testimony, such as the invalidation of his right, and the forbidden money of the Muslim, as well as the sake of the sake.* * * Then he said: Whoever holds it, it is the sinner of his heart and in which there are issues: the first question: the sinner, the abundant, it was narrated that Omar was teaching Arab The tree of the qaqum is the food of the sinner [smoke: 43, 44], so he said: the food of the orphan, so Omar said to him: the food of the dawn.This indicates that sin in the sense of immorality.The second question: The owner of the “scout” said: A sinner, and his heart was raised with a sin on the effectiveness of the effectiveness, as if it was said, so he praises his heart, and his heart is a heart.By opening, as his saying, his soul is his soul [Al -Baqarah: 130] and the son of Abi Abla read (he praised his heart), that is, he made him sinful.The third question: Know that many of the speakers said.The actor, the knowledgeable, the mourning, and the endowment is the heart, and this is the question of this question in the surah of the poets in the interpretation of his saying: “He descended from the righteousness of the soul.” 193, 194] And we reminded us of his interpretation of his saying: Say: Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel, then he has revealed it to your heart [Al -Baqarah: 97] And they say: It is the highest, he added the sinner to the heart, and had it not been for the heart that is the active, otherwise it would not be a sinner.And those who are afraid in this saying answered that the addition of the verb to a part of the parts of the body, but it is for the sake of the greatest reasons for the insult to that action, but it is the same.It is said: This is what my eyes visited and heard my ears and knew it my heart, and it is said: So and so is the fool of the vineyard; It is known that the actions of the wounds are a follower of the actions of the hearts and the generation of what happens in the hearts of the reasons and the particles, so when the matter was like that, then this is the same The sinner is here to the heart.Then he said, Azz and Galleh: And God is what you do know, and he warns of the feet on this killing; Because the cost of the cost, if he knew that he does not sing out from the knowledge of God, the guerrilla of his heart was a disagreement warning against the contrary of the command of God Almighty, for he knows that he is alive.Acts, and it is rewarded for it if good is good, and if evil is evil.
