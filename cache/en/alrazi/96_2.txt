The Quranic researcher (P-14) [Surah Al-Alam] Al -Fatih is the first thing that came down and then the wall of the pen.﷽ Read in the name of your Lord, know that in the B is from his saying: in the name of your Lord, two sayings: One of them: Abu Ubaidah said: The Ba is an increase, and the meaning is: Al -Harir, not the Lords of the Blacks of the Mustarah, do not read the fence and the meaning of the name of your Lord, that is, remind his name, and this is a weak saying: Remember the name of your Lord, what is good for him to say: I am not reader, that is, I do not remember the name of my Lord.And the second: that this matter is not appropriate for the Messenger, because he had no work except for the remembrance of God, so how does he command him that he would be worn out.And the third of it: that it is the pledge of allegiance to it.The second saying: that what is meant is from his saying: (Read), that is, read the Qur’an, as the reader is not used except in it, he said: If we read it, then follow the Qur’an: And a Qur’an that we separated to read it to people on a stay [Al -Asra: 106] and his saying: In the name of your Lord, he will be enticed by his face So the estimation will be: Read the Qur’an openly in the name of your Lord, that is, say: in the name of God, then read, and in this significance that it is obligatory to say: As God Almighty revealed and commanded it, and in this verse is a response to those who do not see that duty and do not start with it.And the second: that the meaning is to read the Qur’an seeking the name of your Lord as if it makes the name a machine when he is able to do it from the matter of religion and the world, and the opposite, and the opposite, and the opposite, He said to him: Read and said to him: I am not a reader, so he said: Read in the name of your Lord, that is, seek help from your Lord and take him in this way.And the third of it: that his saying: Read in the name of your Lord, that is, make this action to God and do it for his sake, as you say: The son of this is the same and this is this The minister and for his sake, for worship, if it becomes for God, is up to God, so how will the Satan be seen to be behaved as it is for God Almighty?If it was said: How is this interpretation in your saying before the elderly: in the name of God, as well as before every permissible act?We said: In it, it is good: one of them: that is a metaphorical addition, as it adds your loss to some of the adults to be pushed with that injustice of the injustice, so that you will add to you to the injustice, so that you will add to you, so that you will add The Satan has broken it from your share, so it was narrated that whoever did not remember the name of God, the Satan has been shared in that food.The second: He may have used that permissible to piety on the obedience of God, so the permissible becomes an obedience, and he will be valid for that Construction in it.As for his saying: (Your Lord), he has two questions: One of them is that the Lord is one of the attributes of the verb, and God is one of the names of the self and the names of the self -honored Many of the name of God is honored by the name of the Lord, and then he is the Almighty, he said here: in the name of your Lord, and he did not say: Read in the name of God as he said in the name Merciful).And his answer: He commanded worship, and with the descriptions of the self, and he does not have anything, but rather worshiping worship with the actions of the verb, so it was the same as the one who has been This surah was one of the parents of what was revealed to the Messenger, peace be upon him, so he was terrified, so he dictated it to remove the scarecrow, so he said: He is the one who is your Lord, so how is it?So this letter has reported two meanings: one of them: your Lord, so let the judiciary obligate you, so do not be a lazy.The second: that the hurricane is obligatory for the perfection, and your Lord has been like this, so how I could make you Repeated, knowing how to make you!.The second question: What is the rule that he added himself to him and said: In the name of your Lord?Answer: A tire that adds himself to the profile, as he is, and a woman who adds it to itself with the slaves, the captives of his servant, his counterpart.From me and I am from him, “as if he is the Almighty saying: He is for me and I have it, his saying is the Almighty saying: Whoever obeys the Messenger, then God has obeyed [the women: 80] or we say: the addition of his soul Add the servant to him, as he has been aware of the witness that whoever has a son who benefits them without the minor Exalted: The one who will reach me to me, and you did not pray from you as a servant and no obedience until now, so I say: I am for you and I do not say that you are to me, then if you come from what you have asked from you or from you My soul said: He descended on his servant: My servants who have been pleased with [Al -Zamer: 53].The third question: Why did he mention his saying: (Your Lord) said: Who created?The answer: As if the servant says: What is the evidence that you are my Lord?He says: Because you were in your own and your characteristics.Then you have become a struggle, so you must have in your self and your attributes from an uncle, and this creation and creation is rabble, so that I will be your Lord and you are my Lord.* * As for his saying, the Almighty: He who created the creation of the human being from a relationship, in which he has books: the first question: in the interpretation of this verse three or the same: one of them: He who created an effective one, and the meaning is that it was the creation of the creation and the influence of it, not the creator of its parts.The second: that a verb is estimated for him and the meaning is that he created everything, so every creature is taken, because he is divorced, He does not carry him on one of the first of his pregnancy on the rest, as our saying: God is greater, that is, from everything, then he said after that: the creation For a person to be remembered among the sentences of the creatures, either because the download is to him or because it is the honor of what is on the face of the earth.And the third: to be his saying: Read in the name of your Lord, who created a vague, then then made it easy with his saying: He created the human being from the relationship A wonder of his breakfast.The second question: The companions took this verse that there is no creator other than God Almighty, they said: Because he was the one who made the Creator, a distinction, a characteristic of the same And every adjective is this matter, for it is the impact of the partner in it.Pharaoh when he asked the truth of God, so he said: What is the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Shua’ar: 23] Moses said: Your Lord and the Lord of your parents are the first of the poets [Al -Sha’ar: 26] Huhhh, and all of that indicates our saying.The third question: the speaker agreed upon that the first obligations are the knowledge of God, or the view in the knowledge of God or the intention to that view on the one Between them, then the wise, they gave him when he wanted to send him a messenger to the participants, and if he said to him: Read in the name of your Lord, who is not for him, for the sake of God But he came to this progress that brought them to the knowledge of it, as it is said that he was exhaled when Abu Hanifa sent to the Basra, for the insight, for the sake Hanifa Zawfah and did not stop him, so he returned to Abu Hanifa.And tell him about that, and he said: You did not know the way of Tablag, but I return to them, and remember in the question, the sake of their imams, then the one who has been.After that: Here we are another saying, and I remember my saying and my Hajj, so if this is possible in their heart, then say: This is the saying of Abu Hanifa, because they are so So they do not respond, so we are here that the truth is the one who says: “These are the worshipers of the two, so if you were on me and you are exposed to the two of you, for you, for you, for you They are the ones who were created from the relationship, so they cannot be denied, then say: There must be no act of an actor, so they cannot add that to the one who does not know.In this way, they acknowledge that I am the one who deserves to the same without the second, as he said: And if I asked them whoever created them, they would say to God [Al -Zakhr: 87] The divine is eager to the Creator and the cuts occurred that whoever did not create it was not a God, then this is the Almighty: Whoever creates as he does not create [17] And the verse indicated that the saying of the privilege is false, because the influence
