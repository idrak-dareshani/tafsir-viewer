The Quranic researcher, as he said, is the Almighty: They said: He heard us and disobeyed us, and he has anxes: the first question: that the shadow of the mountain is not a doubt that it is one of the most disturbances, and it is with you They disbelieved and stated that they have heard and disobeyed us, and this indicates that disagreement, even if a bone is not required to be destroyed.The second question: the most interpreter of the interpreters, they were known that they said this saying.On the authority of that by saying, and if they did not say it as the Almighty saying: to say to him, be, and he will be [Al -Baqarah: 177] and his saying: They said: “The first of the words:” On his appearance, without evidence, it is not permissible.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: And drink in their hearts the calf, in it in the issues: the first question: and drink in their hearts the love of the hurry, and in the face of this Jahan: The first: with it, his love and the kernel over their worshipers are overwhelmed by his worshipers, as the garment interferes, and his saying: In their hearts, with a place for the sake They eat in their stomachs a fire [Women: 10].The second: Just as drinking is a material for the life of what the land comes out, so that love was a material for all of the verbs.The second question: His saying: And they are drinking that it is an actor other than them, so he did with them, and it is known that he is not able to do so, and he answered, Jahin: The first: God did not want that others did they do with them, but they are for their excessive and their obedience and their familiarity with his servants, and they will be blessed with their hearts.He did it as it is said: So and so is a fan of itself.The second: that what is meant is from the drinking of any decorating it with them and invited them to him like the Samaritan, Abelis, and the Thighs of Man and Heaven.The companions answered about the two guys that both of the two directions are a scourge for the memorial of his appearance, and that is not permissible to destiny to it except for a spoiler, and we are not.The catastrophe is that the modernity of all the things is God, and we have no need to leave this phenomenon.As for his words, the Almighty: with their disbelief, what is meant by their intention to likelihood, and their permanence of worship, for others, will be glorified and exalted.As for his saying: Say a smile that your faith commands you, and he has two issues: the first question: what is meant is a matter of what he commands you to do with your faith, for the sake of God, for the sake of God, for the sake of God.The calf, and adding the matter to their faith is a matter of being as he said in the story of Sha’ab: Your origins are your command [Hood: 87], as well as the addition of faith to them.The second question: Faith is a symptom and is not valid from it, but the one who calls for the verb may be likened to the matter as the Almighty saying: The prayer is forbidden..As for his words, the Almighty: If you are believers, then what is intended to be interested in their faith and praise is in the health of their call.
