The researcher of the Qur’an is glorified and exalted: It is among the people who take from God as a dump that loves them like the love of God and those who believe in the most love of God, and if he sees the people of God The power of God is all, and that God is the hardship of torment.Because the ugliness of against the thing is what the good thing confirms, and for that the poet said: “And they will be disturbed by the things and they also said:“ The grace is a matter I know, and people do not know the amount of health, so if they are satisfied and then the health is returned to them, they know its destiny, and so say in all the blessings, for this The verse indicating the neutrality of this verse, and here are the issues: the first question: As for the peer, it is the likeness of the righteous, and it is clear that it is true in it Al -Sura: Do not make God to be more than God Followed, and they hoped for the benefit and the harm, and they intended them with the books, and they were vowed to the vows, and approached the two sins, which is the saying of the most of the evils, Some of them are for one, that is, a proverb that is not a dump of God, or the meaning: it is an increase in God, according to the corrupt thinking.And the second: that they are the masters who obeyed them, and they would be solved because they obeyed what God forbade, and they forbid what God has permitted, from the sixth.And those who say this saying, they have liked this saying to the first of his faces: The first: that his saying: they love them as the God of God, the distraction and the mim in which the guilt of the mind.The second: It is a distance that they loved idols as God loved them with their knowledge that they did not harm or benefit.The third: that God Almighty mentioned after this verse: when those who followed those who followed those who follow [Al -Baqarah: 166] and that is not met with the one who is a good man Excellencies, you commit to their greatest and purpose for what the believers are committed to from the purpose of God Almighty.The third saying: In the interpretation of the dump: the saying of Sufis and the knowledgeable, which is that everything you occupied your heart with it except God Almighty, so he has made it to you What is meant by his saying: You have seen those who have taken his gods (Al -Jathiya: 23).As for the saying of the Almighty: they love them as the love of God, so know that what is meant is the love of them And the purpose is for them, or all of that, and its saying: the love of God is in it three sayings: it was said in it: as they love God, and it was said in it: like love It is necessary for them to God, and it was said in it: the love of the believers to God, but they disagreed with this difference from where they were disagreed with that they were not?Whoever said: They used to know him with their taking of the dumping, it is the first that what is meant is like their love for God, and whoever said: They were not known to the Lord of the Lord (P-185) The rest is either like the love that is for them, or the love of the believers of God, and the first saying is close; Because his saying: They love them as the love of God, a return to the people who are presented with their remembrance, and the appearance of his saying: like the love of God, it is a love for God, for God is a love for God It was explained in the righteous verse that God is one, and he warned about his evidence, then he said the saying of those who share with him, and that requires their saying.If it was said: The sane person is okay to be his love for the two as his love for God; This is because the harm of the mind knows that this second is a stones that do not benefit or harm, and do not hear, and do not see or make sense, and they have been unable A wise, and this is the Almighty: And if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say God [Luqman: 25] and with this belief, how is it reasonable to be the one who will be the one who will be the love of them.Like their love for God Almighty, and also, God Almighty told them that they said: We do not worship them except to bring us closer to God, Zarif [Al -Zumar: 3] and if it was like that, the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is like you God is exalted, so how does the level of love rationalize with love with this saying?We said: His saying: They love them as the love of God, that is, in obedience to it and the glorification of it, so the dependence on this saying in love does not contradict what you mentioned.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty: Those who believe in the most love of God, in his interests: the first question: in searching for what is the love of the servant, the best of the servant is: The nation is in the release of this word, which is that the servant may love God Almighty, and the Qur’an is deleted with him, as in this verse, and as in his saying: He loves them: [54] The news, it was narrated that Abraham, peace be upon him, said to the king of the death, peace be upon him, and he came to him to the arrest of his soul: Did you see a successor who would die his cell?So God Almighty revealed to him: Did you see a caliph to be hidden to meet his succession?He said: O king of death now, get up.And an Arab came to the Prophet ﷺ and he said: O Messenger of God, when the hour is?Prayer and peace: the woman is with those who love." Anas said: So what I saw Muslims, then they rejoiced with anything after Islam, and they rejoiced with that.It was narrated that Jesus, peace be upon him, passed through three alienation, and their feet were bewitched, and their colors were changed, so he said to them: What is the one He reached you to what I see?They said: Fear is from the fire, and he said: He is a right for God to believe in the caliph.Then he left them to another three, so if they are more severe and changed, then he said to them: What has reached you to this place?They said: The righteous to heaven.He said: God is a right to give you what you are hoping.Then he left them into three others, so if they are more severe and changed, as if they had mirrors from the light, so he said: How did you reach this degree?They said: God's love.And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: You are close to God on the Day of Resurrection.And when Al -Saddi said: The nations claim the Day of Resurrection with its prophets, and it is said: O nation of Moses, and the nation of Jesus, and the nation of Muhammad, other than those who love them God, and in some books: my servant - and your right - for you is a love, so I have the right to you, be a love.And know that the nation, even if they agreed to release this memorial, but they disagreed with its meaning, so the speaking of the speakers said: The love is not.It is related to it except for the biases, so the attachment of love is imposed on the same God, the Almighty and his attributes, so if we say: We love God, so we love God, and God will love, His rewards and charity, and as for those who know, they have said: The servant may love God Almighty for his self, and the love of his servants or the love of his rewards, and he said: We found that the pleasure is loved by itself, and the talisman is also a love for itself, but the pleasure is that if it is said to us: Why are you attached?We said: Let's find money, if it was said: Why do you ask for money?We said: Let us find the eaten and the polytheism, if they said: Why do you ask the eaten and the counseling?We said: Let the pleasure be obtained and the pain will be paid, for if it is said to us: and why do you ask for the pleasure and hate the pain?We said: This is not the same; If it was everything, but it was required for the sake of anything else, it was necessary for either the sectarian For itself, and if it is proven, then we know that the pleasure is required to obtain itself, and the mother is required to pay for itself, not because of another because of another The prophets and the princes are for the extermination of their essences, with the descriptions of the cumin How of their courage, our hearts have been made to them, so that this may reach that money to spending the great money in the report of its greatness, and the most In the spirit, and the universe of the pleasure is a lover of itself, it does not contradict the fact that the cumin is loved by its own.If this is proven, then we say: Those who carried the love of God, the Almighty, with the love of his obedience, or on the love of his reward That the pleasure is a loved one for itself, and they did not know that the dawn is loved by itself, but those who are known to those who said: It is a loved one in the same and for itself, and it is the same, and it is the same.To them that the talisman is a lover of itself; And that is because the fullness of the full of the right is the right to be glorified and exalted, because it is a duty and its existence is rich in all that is its promise, and the fullness of everything is, and it is beneficial to it, The fullness of knowledge and ability, if we love the knowledgeable man for his possession in his knowledge, and the brave man for his assault in his courage, and the man who is not the one who is not Acts, how do we not love God and all the sciences with the lineage to his knowledge like nods, and all destiny with the lineage to his destiny is like a number, and all of them is the same Surveillance with the lineage to the right of that of that is like a number, so the cut is required that the love of the right is God Almighty, and that it is loved in the same and for its soul, and it is the same, and it is the same.Other than him, and know that when you stood up to the joke in this section, then he said: The servant has no way to see God on God It can reach him to that place, so no one who has been brought up to the rituals of God and his destiny in the creatures was in the creatures, so he did not know.Human, and when it was not an end to the paths of the servants of the servant on the rituals of the wisdom of God, the exalted, then there is no generosity, no end to the paths of the love of worshipers.Then there is another condition, which is that if the servant, his reading of the righteousness of the wisdom of God Almighty, will be exalted.That is due to the administering of the love of God, the Almighty, the heart of the servant, and his thief in it in the example of the descending diameters of the water on the silence of the silence, so it is with it, so it is with it, so it is with it.The slander, if the love of God is kept in the heart, the heart is sufficient for its sufficiency, and its thousands are accustomed to it, and the more it is the same.Because the fools of what he promised to turn away from the fools to it, and the obstacle of the presence of the loved ones is his deceitful, so the love of God is still punished The heart, and each one of them is accustomed to the other, until the heart becomes an alienation from what is God Almighty, and the blow requires symptoms, except God, and symptoms are the only one, So that the heart becomes enlightened by the lights of Jerusalem, as a result of the lights of the world of infallibility, so it is about the fortunes attached to the world of the sides, and this is the one who is in the world of This world is an example, except for the loved one, for anything, so you see from the merchants who are busy with the money of the money who forgot his hunger And his food and his drink at the time of being used to keep the money, so if this is reasonable in that eclipse (P-187), then how can it be followed by that.* * * He misses him, if he did not see a person and did not hear and describe him, he did not imagine that he will miss him, and if he realizes as his money, he will not be lost to him, then he will be lost to him, then he will be lost to him One of them: If he sees it, then he misses it, he missed the continuation of his imagination with vision.And the second: to see the face of his love and not see his hair, nor a calm of his merits, so he misses until he reveals what he did not see as a cat, and the vagina is all in the right, They are the same as the harm to all those who know, for those who have become clear to those who are divine matters, even if it is in the end of clarity, is confused with the wounds of the fantasies, not the fantasies In this world, it is exposed to simulation and al -Mittalat, and it is a perception of the spiritual codes, and the time of the manifestation does not get the other in the hereafter, and this requires the arrogance This is one of the most prominent types, while it became clear.The second: that the divine matters are not ended for them, but it reveals to every servant of worshipers, some of them, and things remain that there is no end to them, so if he knows that he knows His mind is more than what is attended, so he is still a detence to its knowledge, and the one who is the first interpretation is ended in the last house of the last, and the meaning of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the meaning It is not imagined that it is in the world, and the one who is narrated by the second interpretation, so it does not like it to have an end; As his end to reveal to the servant in the hereafter the majesty of God and his attributes, and his wisdom in his actions, and it is not ethnic, and the view is on the other hand Impossible, and you have known the truth of the righteous to God Almighty, and know that the good thing is a delicate; Because the servant, if it is in the promotion, is obtained by the punishment of the affliction, the deprivation, and the communication, and the replacement is the pain of the delights, and the pleasures, the sacrifice of the forbidden It was stronger, so it is like that this type is from the pleasure of what is only for good news, for the angels are like their levels present with the verb, and the Bahas is not Faculty, they are the frequency between the sides of the lips and the loud.The third question: In Bayan, those who believe are more loved to God, but those who speak Glorious, praise and praise, and worship is pure from the polytheism, and when it does not want to be lost, and the love of others is not like that.The second: that their love for God has been associated with hope, reward, and desire in the greatness of his house, and fear of punishment and taking in the way of disturbance, and who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one and who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the worshiper of his house This limit is his love for God is more severe, and as for those who are known, they said: The believers are those who knew God with the destiny of the human being, and the one who has gone out, Arifa, so the word is their knowledge, the more they must be more severe, so it was said: How can it be said: the love of the believers is the one who is the one They come with hard obediences that do not come with anything from them, one of the Muslims, and they only come to them except for God Almighty, and then they kill themselves with love for God.The answer is from his faces: one of them: that those who believe in only to God, with the disagreement of the participants, are that they are modified to God with the need, and when the pilgrims have come to.Hope: If they ride in the ark, they prayed to God, who have the religion of the debt [the spider: 6] to the last, and the believer is not exposed to God in the harm, the sacra, the sake of the sake, the sake of the sake, the sacra, the sake of the sake, the sake of the sake of the On the authority of his Lord, the love of the believer was stronger.And the second: that whoever loves others is satisfied (P-188) with his judgment, so he does not disagree with his king They kill themselves with his ear, and that is in jihad.And the third of it: that if a person is afflicted with the hard torment, it cannot be worked out with the knowledge of the Lord, so who did it is false.And he pushed it: Ibn Abbas said: The participants were worshiping a word, and if they saw something that is better than it, they left that and accepted the servants of the good.Fifthly: that the believers unite their Lord, and the disbelievers worship with the idols, so the love of the one, and the one is the one who will be the same.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty is: If those who have been wronged, they will see the torment that the power of God is all, then it has an questions: the first question: the knowledge is that this is the one who is in the sake of this.The first search: Nafaa and Ibn Omar read: (If you see) with the piousness of the ritual from the rhetoric of the Prophet, peace be upon him, as if he said: If you see you, O Muhammad With the despair of the one who is under the authority of those who have been remembered, as if he said: And if he see those who did wrong to themselves by taking the dump, then he said: Because the Prophet ﷺ and the Muslims have taught what the disbelievers see, and they are appointed from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, but the users are in this matter, then they are the one who does not know.That is, so the action is required to them.The second research: They disagreed with (Yarhin), and Ibn Amir read: (Rawn) with the addition of yaa on the endeavor, and his pilgrimage was his saying: Their work is a severity of them [Al -Baqara: 167] and the rest (they see) by opening the addition of the vision to them.The second research: They disagreed with (that), so he read some readers (that) by breaking the thousand on the one, and the seven readers are on the opening of the thousand.The loyal research: When I knew that those who have been wronged by the readers of the impermissible, the one who is on the authority of the picnic and the one who is taken from the suffocating of it, and the one who said: By opening the hamsti from (that) and the last of its fraction, it is the same as the four aspects: the first involvement: to read and if he sees the disagreement from the time of the And the face in it is that they have worked in the power, and the ability: and if they see that the power is for God, and it is meaning: and if he see those who have been injustice to the people of God Take from it without it, so on this (if) is deleted, and it is many in the download as its saying: and if you see when they stood on the fire: [27] The unjust in the dies of death [Al -Anam: 93], even if a Qur’an was followed by the mountains [Thunder: 31] and they said: If you saw, then we would be taken from it, and this is taken from it.And the greatest; Because on this estimation, the address of the addressee goes to every one of the bonds, so fear is on this estimation, if it is appointed to him.The second indifference: to read the afflicted with the underwrinner under the fracture of the hazardine from (if) and appreciation: and if those who have been wronged, they will be rewarded with the state of the witness, the one who is the same as the one who is the same as the one who is the same The power of God.The third indifference: to read the pious from the above, with the opening of the hamsti from (that), which is the luxury of a sophisticated and Ibn (P-189) Amir, the farewell said: The vision, and the appreciation in it: and if you see those who wronged, when they see the torment, you see that the power of God is all.The fourth of the fully: to read the pious from the above, with the breaking of the ham All, and this is also a good phenomenon.The second question: If it was said: How can his saying come: If those who have been wronged, he will be unjust while he was accepted with his saying: when they see the torment and (when) for me?We said: Rather, it came to the memorization of the past; Because the end of the hour is close, the Almighty said: The command of the hour is only the word of sight or is it closer [Al -Nahl: 77] and he said: Perhaps the hour is close [Al -Shura: 17] and everything that was the proximity What happened and got up, and on this interpretation, the Almighty said: He called the companions of paradise [Al -A'raf: 44] and said the resident: The prayer rose, and that before the rhythm of the rhythm of the rhythm of the rhythm of the rhythm of the rhythm of the rhythm of the ritual That, and many came in the download from this section, he said: If you see when they were standing [Al -Anam: 27], and if you see when the unjust [Al -Anam: 93], and if you see, then they will be.You see when he dies [Al -Anfal: 50].
