The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: He who has earned a bad and surrounded by his sin, for those who are the people of the fire in which they are immortal.The Almighty said: The fire will not touch us, that is, I will never touch you with the evidence of his saying: they are in it empty.As for the bad, it is all the sins.The Almighty said: A bad, bad, likewise [Al -Shura: 40], whoever does a bad thing is permissible for him [Women: 123] and when it is permissible to think that every good is a small one or a small Whether that her actor is raised in the fire, there is no crime between the Almighty that the one who deserves the immortality is that it is a bad thing that surrounds it, and it is known that there is no way In another body, such as surrounding the wall with the country and the costume with water, and that is a blessing, so we can carry it on whether the bad is great for the one who is the one who is: With it, and the great for her being surrounded by the reward of obedience, such as the ritual of those obedience, and the similarities were from this side.The second: that if the biggest is the reward of obedience, then it was drawn on that obedience and surrounded it as it is surrounded by the enemy of the enemy, with no human being From him, as if he said: He said: “Whoever caught the greatness and surrounded his greatness with his obedience, for those who are the people of the fire are in it, they are immortal, so if it is said: this is the right of the verse We said: The lesson is in general, not with the privacy of the causes, this is the face that the dispersed in it in the proof of the return to the companions of the cabinets.(P-133) Know that this question is one of the most important questions, and let us remember it here, so we say: The people of the kiss were disagreed With their return, and they are two jurisprudence, some of them have proven the standard, which is the saying of the disgraceful and the Kharijites.And among them is those who have proven a decadence and a long time, and he is a saying of the good and the immortal, and from the people who cut off that there is no Eid for them, and he is an anomalous saying that is attributed to the fighter.And the third saying: We cut it that they are pardoned and exempt from some ticks, but we stand in the right of every one who is the one who does not have the right.By that, if he is tormented by one of them, then he never torments him, but he cuts his torment, and this is the saying of the most companions, the followers, the people of the Sunnah, the Sunnah of the Sunnah, So this search is comprehensive on two questions: One of them: in the piece of the back.And the last: that if the return is proven, then this is that of the permanence or not?* * * The first question: in Al -Waad: Let us remember the misfortunes of the disgrace first, then the shivering of the uncle, then our companions, may God have mercy on them.As for the dismissed, they are dependent on the generalities The uniform in this section, and those generals are on two directions.Some of it was returned with the form of “who” in the exposure of the condition and some of it and returned in the form of the collection, while the first types are verses: one: the saying of the exaltation in the verse of God: [Women: 13] To his saying: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger and prepares his limits, he will enter it with an immortal fire in it [An -Nisa: 14], and we have taught us that whoever leaves the prayer, the ritual, the ritual, the ritual, the ritual, the blessing, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the blessing, the blessing, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the zakat, the blessing, the zakat, the blessing, the zakat, the blessing, the blessing, the zakat, the blessing, the blessing, the zakat, the blessing, the blessing, the blessing, the blessing, the blessing, the blessing, the blessed, Drinking wine and adultery and killing the forbidden soul, it is prepared for the limits of God, so it is obligatory to be from the people of punishment, and that is because the word of “ The general is on what you have proven in the origins of jurisprudence, so when the summary carried this verse on the infidel without the believer, that was on the convergence of the evidence, then the one who said: One of them: It is the Almighty between his limits in the inheritances, then he promises those who obey him in those limits and return to those who disobey him in them, and whoever is in the faith of the faith and the faith of it Obedience to whom it is denounced by his lobby and a lie to his messengers and his parts, so he desires him to obey in it, in which he is more than one who is closer to obedience The believer was intended for the first verse, as well as the last.The second: He said: Those are the limits of God [Women: 13] and there is no suspicion that what is intended is the one who is mentioned, and then he was suspended by obedience in it, in which the one is in it, and the one who is in it.The return is attached to disobedience in these limits, so only to join that intensity of another limit Just, and if he was not intended to do so, he would not be mixed with him, and if you prove that the believer is intended for it, like the infidel, he will be the saying of those who are not.Hope: Its limits [Women: 14] is an added collection and the collection added to you is the benefit of the general, as if it was said: I was stripped of my servants, and it is that it is a whole, and if it is a whole.That is the one who has seen this verse with those who exceeded all the limits of God, and that is the infidel, not the case without the believer.There are two readers that indicate that it is not what is meant, we are preparing all the limits: one of them: that he is up to his saying: He is the one who said: His saying was spent: His limits are to those limits.And the second: that the nation is agreed upon that the believer is mixed with this verse from the ticks, and if it is true, you would be mentioned, the believer is unaware.And the third of it: that if we had the verse on the merit of all the limits, we would not have a good return because one of the costs does not exceed (P-133) The unimaginable is unable to collect Between it in the transgression of its contradiction, for it is not possible to be able to believe in one case, which goes to the enemies and the victory, and there is no one who is found in the one Snap.And its elevation: His exalted say in the murderer of the believer is a baptized: and whoever kills a believer intentionally, his reward is hell, immortalized in it [Women: 93], the verse is indicated by the absence This part of his saying is attributed to him: He who does bad will be rewarded [Women: 123].Fifth: His Excellency said: O you who believe if you are not the ones who disbelieved [Al -Anfal: 15] to his saying: And whoever inspires the day of his arrangement, or for his time It is biased to a category, and it was lost in anger of God and his passion of hell and the misery of destiny [Al -Anfal: 16].And its sixth: His exalted say: Whoever does the weight of an atom is better than sees.And whoever does the weight of an atom is evil, he sees [the earthquake: 7].And the one who followed it: His Excellency said: O you who believe, do not eat your mother among you with falsehood [Women: 29] to his words, the Almighty: And whoever does that is a ritual and shadow, and he will be a fool and a long time [Women: 30].And the eighth: His Exalted: He is the one who comes to his Lord as a crime, for he has a hell that does not die in it and does not live.And whoever comes to him is a believer who has done the righteous, then those who have the highest degrees [Taha: 74, 75], so he showed that the infidels and the immorality are among the people of the punishment that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the reward.And the ninth: His Excellency said: He has disappointed those who carried unjustly [Taha: 111], and this must be the oppressor from the people of prayer within this time.And I adore it: His Excellency after the number of ticks: and whoever does that he will receive sins.The torment is expelled for him on the day of resurrection, and he is immortalized in it.And the union is ten: His Almighty said: Whoever comes with goodness has a good from them, and they are from the fear of the day.And whoever comes to the deprivation [ants: 89, 90], and this indicates that all sins are used to them, as all obedience are promising.The second is ten: His exaltation said: As for whoever overwhelms.And the impact of the worldly life.The hell is the shelter [Al -Nidaat: 37, 38, 39]..The third is ten: His exalted say: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, then he has a fire of hell [Al -Jin: 23] the verse, and he did not separate between the infidels and the immoral.And the four -year -old: His Excellency said: I have a bad one and his sin was surrounded by the verse.The fire only touched us for numbers, then God lied to them, and then he said: He who has earned a bad thing and surrounded him with his sin, so you are the first of you This is the verses that they are in question to be in question.The condition is and infer that this word benefits the general in the face: one of them: that if it was not a place for the public, it was either a place Participated between them and the virtues are invalid, so it is obligatory to be a place for the public, but it is not permissible for it to be a place for the peculiarities, so if it is for you, so if it is for you, for it is that it is for you.It is good for the speaker to give the part to everyone who brought the condition, because this estimation is not that of that part of that If he said: Whoever enters my house, I will honor him, that he is good to honor everyone who entered his house, then he knew that this word is not for the abundance, and it is not for the sake of the thief It is a place for your destruction, but first: because the partner is the disagreement of the original, and the second: because if it was like that, it was not known as how to repent the part of the part of the part The understanding of all the possible sections, such as that if he says: Whoever enters my house, I will honor him, then he will be said to him: You wanted the men or the women, then if he said: I wanted the men: If he said: I wanted the Arabs, it is said to him: I wanted a rabbit or (P-135) is harmful and he was gone until he came to all of the possibilities, and when he knew about the goodness of us This is the knowledge that the saying of the vision is false.And the second: that if he said: Whoever enters my house, I will be honored by the best of each one of the mind We are a conflict that the one who excels from the spectrum must be, and that it is correct to enter it under the one who is the one who is alive from it.As for the first: because it is necessary that there is no one between the discretion from the gathering that denies it as his saying: The jurists came to me except for more and between the one who is the same The jurisprudence came to me except for a difference of the validity of the entry of more in the two words, but the difference between them is known as the harm.As for the second: because the one of the number of the number comes out of what it is, if it is obligatory, it is obligatory to enter it, so it is necessary for this to be the benefit of the discretion in all of the places in all The language of the language was not separated between the unlikes and between the unlikes, other than it, so it was proven by what we reminded that the one who does not come to the words of what is not.It is obligatory to enter it in it and that indicates that the form of “who” is in the presentation of the condition for the general.And the third of it: that it is up to the words of his saying: You and what you worship without God, the punishment of hell [Al -Anbiya: 98] The verse, Ibn Al -Zabari said: Isn't the angels?The prayer and peace be upon him, and it was not denying that, and it was indicated that this formula benefits the general.* * * The second type: from the disgraceful evidence: holding in Al -Waqid in the form of a collection defined by the thousands and the blame, and it is in the verses of one of them: the saying of the exaltation: 14] Know that the judge, the Jubai, and Abu al -Husan say: This formula is beneficial to the general, and Abu Hashem says: It does not benefit the general, so we say: For the general wives: one of them: that the supporters, when they asked the imam, the father of Bakr, may God be pleased with him, took upon them by saying to him Peace be upon that pilgrimage, and if the collection does not indicate the lament of genius on the exodus, that indication was not true, because our saying: Some of the people of the imams are not An imam was provided with other people.As for the fact that all the imams are from a Quraysh, it contradicts some of the imams from others, and it was narrated that Omar, may God be pleased with him, said to my father with a good man The Prophet said ﷺ: “I was commanded to fight people until they say there is no god but God.” He benefits him, but justice to the discretion, and he said: He is upon him the prayers and peace, he said: “Except with its right”, even if the zakat is of its right.And the second: that this gathering is certain of what is required for the exploitation, so it is necessary to benefit the exposure, but it is confirmed that it is confirmed by the Almighty: So, the Almighty said: [Al -Hijr: 30] As for after the affirmation, it is required for the exposure, so by consensus, and as for when it was like that, it was necessary to be the affirmation in the origin of the one who is the one who is the one who is in the origin of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the origin of the one who is in the origin of the one who is in the origin of his origin for the one The name of confirmation is a consensus, and the affirmation is the strengthening of the judgment that was steadfast in the origin, if it was not the darkening in the original, but it is the same (P-136) (P-36) It was not the effect of this conservation in the power of judgment, but rather in giving new ruling, and it was clear to the glorious, not sure, We knew that the exploitation was necessary.And the third of it: that the thousand and the blame, if it enters the name, the name becomes known, as is the transmission of the people of the language, so it must be shrouded in what is in it When he divorces his scourge to all, because he is a knowledge of the addressee, and his behavior is not without all.It remains unknown.If you say: If he benefits a gathering specialized from that gender, then he benefited from that sex, I said: This is a good thing, I was a bid, because he said, because he said: I saw men, he benefited The curiosity of that sex and its distinction from others, indicated that the thousand and the blame are increasingly increased and it is only the darkening.And the one who is seen: that it is correct to find out any one from it and that is the benefit of the general.Fifth: The universal collection is to perform the many, according to the denial, because it is correct to distribute the denier from the knowledge The men, and I do not say the men of men from men, and knowing the harm that the one who is removed from it is more than the one who is removed, if this is proven, then it is said: The one who is the one What is without it, and the second: is invalid because there is no number without everyone except and it is correct to remove it from the universal gathering, and you have learned that the one who is more than it is more than that The benefit of all and God knows.As for the way of Abu Hashem, which is that the universal gathering does not benefit the general, so it is possible to hold on the verse of two other faces: With the highness, he said: The jaws are in hell [breakfast: 14] It requires that immorality is the cause, and if you prove that, the general judgment is required for the general This section is a third way that the grammarians remember, which is that the pain is in its saying: The jaws are not a lameness, but it is in the sense of the one who is the one who is the one who has the same In fulfillment, as the Almighty saying: The shed and the shed, so they cut their hands [Al -Ma’idah: 38], and you say: He who meets me has a dirham.The second: It is correct the verb of the verb on the thing that entered this mother of him.That his saying: The believers in the sense: Those who believed, when it is true that his saying is conveyed to him: And they will lend to God, and if he is proven, then he is the one who said: Hell [Al -Infitar: 14] It is meaning: Those who have died in hell, and that is the benefit of the general.The second verse in this chapter: His Excellency said: The day we are governed by those who are righteous to the Most Merciful and the Reddown and the Cross of the Grands of the Hell and the Fard [Maryam: 85] A group defined with a thousand and the mouth.And the third of it: His Excellency said: The vow of the oppressors in it is corpse [Maryam: 72].And its elevation: His exalted say: And if God takes people to what they have been blessed with what was left on its noon from the bears, but he will delay them [Fattar: 45] showed that it is a good thing This is true that they would get their punishment on that day.* * * The third type: from the world: the form of the crowd with the perception of the ritual: one of them: the saying of the Almighty: Woe to the people who are those who are those who are those who are among those [Motivin: 1].And the second: His Excellency said: Those who eat the money of orphans are injustice, but They eat in their stomachs a fire [Women: 10].And the third of it: His Exalted, the Exalted: The angels of the angels, the angels of themselves [Al -Nahl: 28], and show what is worth the leaving of the migration and the leaving of the ritual, and the leaving of the victory, (P-137) and his Messenger.And its seed: His Excellency said: Those who have earned the bodies a bad reward with the same and their humiliation is humiliation [Yunus: 27] and he did not separate in the end of the return between the other.Fifth: His Excellency said: Those who are bothering gold and silver and do not spend it in the path of God [Tawbah: 34].And its sixth: His exalted say: and the repentance of those who do the fasts [Women: 18] and if the evildoer would not be from the people of the return and the torment, it was not for the one who is not.It was not a need.And the sequence of it: His Excellency said: Rather, the reward of those who fight God and His Messenger, and they will be in the land, so that they would be killed or crucified [Al -Ma’idah: 33] In the world and the hereafter.And eighth: His exalted say: Those who buy the covenant of God and their faith in a few at a few of you have no creation in the hereafter [Al -Imran: 77].* * * The one who is the lifeline of the world: His Exalted: He will be overwhelmed by what they have left with the Day of Resurrection [Al -Imran: 180] The fifth types of the worlds: the word “every” is the saying of the Almighty: even if every soul has been wronged in the land, I would have remedied it [Yunus: 54], so he explained what is His injustice.The sixth type: What indicates that it is a chain of transmission, and it must do what they promised with it, and it is the saying of the Almighty: He said: Do not be silent for me, and I have come to you.What changes the saying to me and what I am in a shadow of the slave [Q: 28, 29] showed that he does not change his saying in Al -Waed The excuse of the excuse is the validity of the feud, that is, after the feet of the return, it did not remain for anyone with a cause and no savings from his torment.The second: His words are: What changes the saying to me [Q: 29], and this is clear that it is necessary and it must be done and that what is indicated by the memorization is for it, so this is the whole of what you are.Quran.* * * As for the news of the news, there is a lot.The first type: the one who is mentioned in the form of “who”: one of them: what was narrated by the narration of the son of Rabia on the authority of Al -Muswar ibn Shaddad.He said: The Messenger of God said: From the fire of hell, and whoever takes his brother as a sake of God from the fire of hell, and whoever rises from the place of a good and a reputation that God has established on the day of the resurrection, the place of the sake of the Lord, He established it: That is, it is permissible for that.And the second: peace be upon him said: “Whoever has two linguistics and those who are in the fire was in the fire with two linguistics, and those who are bodies.” And the third of it: on the authority of Saeed bin Zaid, he said Peace be upon him: “Whoever does not oppress a livelihood from the land that was brought up on the Day of Resurrection from the seven of two lands.And the Muslim is the one who greeted the Muslims from his tongue, and the immigrant is the one who has abandoned badness, and who is my soul in his hand, does not enter Paradise, a servant who does not believe.It is indicated by the feast of the immorality, and it is indicated that it is not a believer or a Muslim on what the dismissal says from the house between the homes.ﷺ: “Whoever comes on the day of the resurrection is innocent of three, he entered the paradise: the arrogance and the two parents”, and this indicates that the owner of these three does not enter the garden, but the garden does not enter.The words are mean, and what is meant is from the religion who died as a disobedience, and he did not want the repentance, and it was not repeated from it.A way that he is asking for a knowledge of God, and he is a way to be a way of paradise, and whoever slows down his work, he did not speed up his proportions.And the salvation of the fire is only with good deeds.He drank the wine in the world and did not pass from it, and it did not drink it in the hereafter.The soul is insisting and the eyes are delighted.With his argument, some of whom I spent the right of his brother, but I cut him a piece of fire.With a mortality, only a deliberate liar, as he said, and whoever kills himself with something that he is tormented in the fire of hell.Prayer: “Whoever preserves it was a light, a wet, and a survivor on the Day of Resurrection, and whoever does not preserve it, it was not a light, no proof, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and a survivor, and whoever does not preserve her, and he has no light, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no light, and a survivor, and whoever has not been preserved on it, and he has no light, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no light, no light, no wilderness, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no light, no light, no night, no, no, no, no, no light, no, no, no, no light, no, no night Qarun, Haman, Farwan, and Abi Bin Khalaf.Peace be upon him: “Whoever meets God is a delegate of wine, he will protect him as a slave and a slave.” He said: peace be upon him: “Whoever kills himself with a neutrality, then he is in his hands, he resorted to him with his stomachs, he will love the fire of hell in it Never, and whoever wants from a deliberate mountain, he killed himself, so he is a frequency in the fire of hell, ever, in which it is ever.The third is the tenth: On the authority of Abu Dhrar, he said: “The peace of peace be upon him said:“ Three will not speak to them, and God does not.They were disappointed and lost?He said: The path, the one and the hypocrisy, its sake of its liar, is a liar.He has a painful torment, so it is one of the people of the fire, and his arrival in the evildoer is a text in the door.The four -year -old: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: He said: “Whoever knows what you know is from what is in which the face of God does not know, and he does not know that He paradise the day of the day of resurrection.”And whoever does not find paradise, then he does not doubt that he is in the fire because the cost is inevitable and that it is in the paradise or in the fire.Peace be upon him: “Whoever has a knowledge of a forth from the fire of the Day of Resurrection.” Let his brother's money be cut off by God, and he is angry with him.The verse, and this is a text in Al -Waqid and a text that the verse is and a resurrection in the immorality, as it is in the infidels.So, he will cut off a Muslim money, without his right, God forbids Paradise, and the fire is obliged to him, it was said: O Messenger of God, if he is: I see you.I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ saying: “Whoever portrays, then God will torment him until he blows in it the soul and does not have a blow, and whoever listens to the hadith of the people His ears now and whoever sees his eyes in the sleeping, what he did not see is that he will be complicated by two rituals.He says: “There is no servant that God will be sponsored by a day of death, and he dies.Uthman when he wanted to give him the judiciary, he said: I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ He said: “Whoever is a judge who decides to ignore the people of the fire, and whoever is a judge.” The twenty -first: peace be upon him said: forbidden" ".The second and the twenty: On the authority of Al-Hasan on the authority of Abu Bakra, he said: He said, peace be upon him: You thought the murder of the Messenger of God ﷺ.Three and ten: On the authority of Abu Saeed Al -Khudari, he said: He said, peace be upon him: The people of paradise because of its words is up to the Almighty: in it the same thing is that the soul is noticed by [Al -Zukhruf: 71].* * * The second type: from the righteous, not in the form of “whoever” is very many: the first: the first: on the authority of a slope of the Messenger of God ﷺ he said: He said: “He said:“ He said: “He said:“ He said: “ Specific, old, old, beech, no time for God with his work, and whoever does not enter paradise from the costs, then it is from the people of the fire with gathering.Al -Thani: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, he said: He said, peace be upon him: Aphrodisiac, and three who enter the fire: an illuminated prince, and a richness of money that does not perform the right of God, and a pharaoh of nobility.The third: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: He said, peace be upon him: You are satisfied with the origin of those who arrived and cut off those who cut you?She said: Yes.He said: So it is.The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Read if you will, then do you have a matter of spoiling in the land and cutting your mercy to those who are the one who is the one who is good for them.” [Muhammad: 22, 23], and this is a text in the feast of the mayor and the interpretation of the verse, and in the hadith of Abd al -Rahman ibn Uf.My name is, so whoever arrived and arrived, and whoever cut it off, ").In the hadith of Abu Bakra that peace be upon him, he said: “There is no sin that is hurry to God for his companion to be the one who will be in the world with what he saves in the last.” Al -Rabaa: On the authority of Mu’az bin Jabl, he said: Peace be upon him, for some of the present: “What God has the right to worship?They said: God and His Messenger know.He said: To worship him and do not share anything with him.He said: So what is their right to God if they do so?[They said: God and His Messenger know] He said: He will forgive them and not torture them.It is known that the condition is related to the condition of the condition, so it is necessary that they do not forgive them if they do not worship it.Fifth: On the authority of Abu Bakra, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: In the murdered?He said: He was free to kill his owner.Muslim.Sixth: On the authority of the mother of Salamah, she said: He said, peace be upon him: Al -Sabaa: On the authority of Abu Saeed Al -Khudari, he said: He said: “And who is my soul in his hand, the family of the house does not hate a man, unless God enters the fire.” Because they deserve it by killing them.The eighth: “In the hadith of Abu Hurairah: We came out with the Messenger of God ﷺ in the year of Khaybar until we were in the villages of the villages, so when a man preserves a man of the Messenger of God ﷺ People are here to have heaven.Fire.“When the people heard that a man came with a tradition or two brightness to the Messenger of God, and peace be upon him, said: A traps from fire or shragans from the fire.” The ninth: On the authority of Abu Barada, on the authority of Abu Moses Al -Ash'ari, may God be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of God said ﷺ: Al -Ashar: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, peace be upon him said: Until God spends between his worshipers on a day, his fate was five thousand years of what you prepare.* * * This is a group that is the most dismissed of the Qur’an and the news.Our companions answered from it from faces: the first: that we do not surrender that the form of “who” is in the presentation of the condition for the public The first things are indicated by him: (P-140) is the first: that it is correct for the two privileges of all and some of these two words, everyone who entered my house, and the one who entered it, It is also said: All people are such, and some people like this, and if they were noticeable, “from the condition, the condition will benefit the darkening, and it would be an introduction to all of it.Some have to be broken, and so in the memorization of the universal gathering, so you prove that this formula does not benefit the general.The second: It is that this formula came in the book of God, and what is meant by the time of expansion and the last one is the most common, for the most common of the Qur’an is special, and the metaphor, the metaphor, the metaphor, the metaphor, the metaphor, the costume, and the costume, and the ritual From making it a fact in the destined destiny between the general and the specials, and that is to bear the most beneficial to the most of it, it is that it is alienated or not.The third: It is that this formula if the general benefit is a state that was impossible for an introduction to the disclosure of the affirmation of it, because the arrival of the one who has been said.This is the most important of us that it does not benefit the meaning of the general A state, we gave us that it benefits the meaning of [the general], but a state of cut or thinking?The first: a variety and a false falsehood, because it is known that people are frequently expressed by the people who express the most of all the words of the whole and the whole of the way.And she was given from everything [ants: 23] If this is the most valid, the meaning of the general is a thought of thought, and this question is not from the problems of the shadow In it in this general, we greeted us that it benefits the meaning of the general active, but it is imperative that there be nothing of the specialists, so there is no disclosure, so there is no confusion, so there is no confusion, so there is no confusion in the Specialization to the year, and why did you say: It was not found anything from the specialty?The most in the door is to say: We search, and we did not find anything from the specialty, but you know that the numbers of the afflictions do not indicate the number of existence.And if the benefit of these altitude is the meaning of the domination, it is standing on the negation of the specializations, and this condition is not known, the connotation was on the authority of the condition Ream, then it is obligatory not to obtain the significance, and from this position, the words of the Almighty: those who disbelieved whether they are on them.[Al -Baqarah: 6] He judged all those who disbelieved that they would not believe, and then we witnessed people of them who believed, so we did not need that one of the two things is necessary for one of the two things: It is a place for the comprehensiveness or because it is, even if it is a subject of this meaning, but there were two centuries in the time of the Messenger ﷺ, they knew that they would know.The general is the peculiarities.As for what was there, it was not permissible for us?We have been delivered from the devotion, but the verses of pardon are special for them and the risks are with us because the verses of forgiveness in the lineage are to the verses of Al -Waad Introduction to the year, not a referral, we gave us that the specialist was not found, but the generalities of the returned are opposed to the generalities Upon, I enter into the generosity from the righteousness.The second: He has been defeated in the news that the mercy of God is a precedent on his anger and is overwhelmed by him, so he would have suggested the generalities of the promise.The third: It is that the good is the right of God Almighty and the promise of the servant of the servant, and the right of the servant is over the crime of the right It came down in the right of the infidels, so it will not be a verse in the generalities, because the lesson was said by the general public, not with the privacy of the causes, we said: Among the general conservatives (P-141) and it was returned in the special reasons, and the intended of these special reasons only our knowledge that its benefit to the general Be strong and God knows.As for those who cut off the negation of the punishment of the people of Al -Kabir, they were brought up with the faces: the first: the saying of the Almighty: The horse is the day and the bad, the bad of the one who is the one who is good.[27] Exalted: We have revealed to us that the torment of those who lied and took over [Taha: 48] This verse indicated that what is the treachery, the bad, and the torment of the disbelief, and the disbelief, One of the individuals of this essence for one of the infidels.The second: His Excellency said: Say: My servants who have been pleased with themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God.All sins are forgiven, and he is not considered repentance, or others, and this is the benefit of the piece with the forgiveness of all sins.The third: His Excellency said: If your Lord is forgiven for people for their injustice [Thunder: 6] and the word “on” the situation is beneficial as your saying: I have seen it If he is associated with eating, then we must forgive God if they are associated with the dark The forgiveness obtains the back of the repentance and the requirement of this verse to forgive the disbelievers to say it to the Almighty: The evil is a great injustice [13] He remained working in the rest.The difference is that the disbelief is greater than the disobedience.The lord: His Exalted, the Exalted: So I warned you a fire that is not prayed except for Al -Ashraqi who has lied and turned around [Al -Layl: 14], and every fire is that it is an unknown, and there is no referral, so it is a matter It is reached only by the one who is the one who is the one who is the liar.Fifth: His Excellency said: Whenever he threw in it, he asked them.A great misguidance [King: 8, 9], the verse indicated that all the people of the fire are false.This verse is not said, especially in the infidels, that you do not see that he says before him: And for those who disbelieve in their Lord, the torment of hell and the misery of the destiny if they are thrown into it It is almost distinguished by anger [King: 6-8].This indicates that it is special in some of the infidels, and they are those who said: We have come to us, so we have lied to us, and we said what God has descended from something, and this is not the same.We say: The significance of what is before this verse on the infidels is not prevented from the general after it.As for his saying: This is not from the saying of the infidels: We do not surrender, because the Jews and the Christians were saying: God has revealed something to you.They have to say what God has descended.Sixth: His Excellency said: And we are rewarded except for infidels [Saba: 17], and this is by building the exaggeration, so he must be summed up with the original disbelief.The seven: It is up after it was told that the people are Sanafan: the whiteness of the faces and their blacks said: As for those who supported their faces, you disbelieved after your faith, then the sake of God: The infidels.And the eighth: that he was transcended, then he made the people three types, the precedents and the companions of the mines, and the companions of the Mashma, indicated that the precedents and the companions of the righteous in the jinn and the companions The fire, then showed that they are disbelievers with his saying: They were saying what you are dead and we were dust and bones, we are not to be happy [the incident: 47].The ninth: that the great owner does not disgrace and everyone who enters the fire is that he is disgraced, so the owner of the oldest does not enter the fire, but we said: The owner of the older does not make the great A believer and the believer is not disgraced.The believer is not disgraced for his faces: (P-142) One of them: His Exalted Exalted: A day that God does not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him [Prohibition: 8].And the second: Its saying: The shame is the day and the bad for the infidels [Al -Nahl: 27].And the third of it: His Excellency said: Those who remind God of resurrection and resurrection, and on their south [Al -Imran: 191] until he told them that they said: Do not store us on the day of the day: He said: Their Lord has answered them [Al -Imran: 195] and it is known that those who remember God are resurrection and resurrection and on their south and think about the creation of the heavens And the adulterer and the mustache of the wine, so when God told them that they said: Do not store us on the day of resurrection, then show that he was upset, and he was replaced by them in that It is an exalted that does not disgrace the disobedience of the people of the kiss.192], and you have proven in the whole two of these two.The tenth: The many are the most common in the promise, the one who said: Those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and the last of you, they are from you and the last of them.Their Lord, and those are the ones who are successful [Al -Baqarah: 4-5], and he governed the lobe on everyone who believed, and he said: Those who believe and those who have guided, the Christians and the people who are the one who believed The last and do good, so they have their reward for their Lord and no fear for them, nor are they grieving [Al -Baqarah: 62], so he said: And he did good [Al -Baqarah: 62] Establishments with one work and he said: Whoever does from the righteous is a male or a female who is a believer, then those are entering Heaven [Women: 124] and it is a lot, and there is a lot, and there is a lot of people He wanted it, so that the message is up.The answer is about These faces: that they are opposed to the generalized generals, and the words of the interpretation of each one of these verses come in its position, if God wills exalted.* * * As for our companions who cut the pardon in the right of some and stand in some, they took the Qur’an with verses: the first argument: the signs of the meaning Pardon, forgiven, as he said: He is the one who accepts the repentance of his worshipers, and they pardoned the secrets, and you know what you do [Al -Shura: 25] As you have earned your hands and pardoned a lot [Al -Shura: 30] and his saying: And from his neighborhood verses in the sea like flags [Al -Shura: 32] to his saying: or he will be able to do what they are.[Al -Shura: 34] And also the nation gathered that God pardoned His servants and gathered on the fact that from the sentence of His names is pardon Those who improve his punishment or those who do not improve his punishment, and this second division is false, because the punishment of those who do not improve his punishment is a rug, and whoever is blessed is like this: He is forgiven, do not you see that if a person does not oppress no one who does not say: He pardoned him, but it is said to him: Pardon, if he has to torture him, then he left him, and he said: Because he is upset, he said: He is the one who accepts the repentance of his worshipers and pardoned the chapters [Al -Shura: 25], and if he was a phrase for the overthrow of the punishment for the punishment of the punishment for the punishment of the punishment for the punishment Unlikely, we knew that pardon is a phrase for the overthrow of punishment, who is good for his punishment, and that is our gold.The second pilgrimage: the verses indicating that it is an unaware, forgiven, and forgiveness.And he said: I am forgiven by those who repented [Taha: 82] and said: We forgive you, our Lord, and you are the destiny [Al -Baqarah: 285].And the forgiveness is not a phrase for the overthrow of the punishment of those who do not improve (P-143) his punishment, so it is necessary for that to be a phrase for the overthrow of the punishment, but the punishment of the punishment, We said: The first face is invalid because it is the highest recitation of the forgiveness in the exposure of the two who are granted to worshipers, and if we were pregnant with the first, there is no one that remains for you.It will be from the servant, but if it was better to its soul, then if he did it, he would have deserved the defamation, the day, and the exit from the limit of the divine.The servant, and when he was prolonged, his pregnancy is appointed to the second face, which is the one who is required.If it is said: Why is it not permissible to carry forgiveness and forgiveness for the last punishment from the world to the hereafter, and the evidence is that the pardon is used in the delay of the His Excellency said in the story of Jews: Then our pardon for you after that [Al -Baqarah: 52] Punishment, but his last to the hereafter, as well as his saying: And what happened to you from the calamity, as you have earned your hands and pardoned a lot [Al -Shura: 30] Its punishment is either on the one hand, or on the side of the hurry, so it is not obligatory for you, and it is not immersed and the punishment and the punishment are not accepted In the sea, like the flags [Shura: 32] to his saying: Or they will meet them with what they have earned and pardoned a lot [Al -Shura: 34], that is, if they want their people to the family of you Sins.And the answer: Pardon is the origin of it from the pardon, that is, it is removed, and if it is also, the name of the pardon must be the removal of the removal, for this is the highest.Delay, but the removal, as well as his saying: And to be exempted from the piety [Al -Baqarah: 237], and that the delay is not intended to a known time, but the projection is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is not the release Pardon is not delaying that if the deceased delayed the request, it is not said: He pardoned him and if he drops it, it is said: He pardoned him, and he has proven that the forgiveness is not.Recently.The third pilgrimage: the verses indicating that it is a merciful, merciful, and he is the same They deserve the reward or to the disobedient who deserves the punishment, and the first is false because his mercy is in their right, either you get it, because he is the Almighty.Because it is preferred against them with what is more than their right.The first is false, because the performance of the duty is not called a mercy, not to see that whoever has a human being is a hundred dinars, so he took it from him as a compassion and a cost that is not said in the one who is given.Mercy, and the second is invalid because the cost has become what was taken from the reward that is its right as the one who is excluded from that preference.Mercy, do not you see that the greatest slander if it is in his servant is a great richness and a complete king It is said: The Sultan has mercy on him, but it is said: He increased in the grave, so we are here.As for the second division: that his mercy appears with the lineage to those who deserve the punishment, either that his mercy is because he is blessed with the torment of the torment The one who is eligible, and this is invalid because it is left that is obligatory and the duty is not called mercy, and because it is necessary to be every disbeliever and the shadow of us is that we are for the sake Be merciful, because he left the punished punishment, and that is not fulfilled in the right of the young owner, nor in the right of the great owner after the repentance, for the punishment, because the punishment, for the punishment, for the punishment of the Fall On the authority of his mercy, it was obtained because he left the punishment of the biggest owner before the dress, then it was said: Why is it not permissible for you to be the mercy of it And the provision is all preferred, and because it is an advertisement that relieves the punishment of the great owner?We said: As for the first, it benefits the same as a merciful in the world, so his mercy is in the hereafter with the fact that the nation is a group that is in his mercy in the past World.As for the second: Because you have the relief from the punishment, it is not permissible, like this (P-144), the saying of the unique, if it is proven that it is established by the ritual of this.The pity of pardon has proven that everyone said one of them said the other.The loyal Hajj: His Excellency said: God does not forgive that he shares with him and forgives what is without that for those who are blessed [Women: 48], so we say: “Whoever does not do.” The young, nor the great owner after the repentance, so it is necessary to be what is meant by the great owner before the repentance, but we said: It is not permissible for him The biggest after the repentance is for its wings: one of it: that his saying is up to the Almighty: God does not forgive that he will be involved in it and forgive what is without that it is not forgiven, not that it is not forgiven He forgives him as a result of the mind and hearing, and if it is also, it is necessary to be the meaning of his saying: He will be forgiven without what is for those who do not Without that polytheism until the negation and the confirmation are confronted with one thing, you do not see that if he said: So that it does not prefer to do so, what is the same It was not a great words, and when the jealousy of the small owner and the owner of the great after the repentance, it was attached, he prevented their children.And the second: that if he said: He forgives what is without that for those who follow that he forgives those who deserve it like the repentance and the loved ones of the listening, and it is not left to the one who remains.Without the polytheism, because it is exaggerated, as it is forgiven without the polytheism at the investigator, and it is not forgiven by the numbers The investigator and does not forgive him at the time of the investigator, so it does not remain for the separation and the discrimination is increased, and the third: that the forgiveness of the repentance and the people of the old man It is not suspended on the will, because the suspended on the will is the one who wants to do it, then he will do it.Father, and the forgiveness is mentioned in the verse related to the will, so it is not permissible for the forgiveness that is mentioned in the verse of the forgiveness of those who repent.And he knows that these faces with their families are shown on the words of the dismissed that the jealousy of the small owner and the owner of the older must be after the time We say that.And its booster: that his saying: He will forgive what is without that for those who are unjust to benefit the pieces that he forgives all that is only the evil and that is the one in which the young and the old man Before the repentance, but the forgiveness of all of these three impersonates two sections, because it is enticed to forgive all His saying: He forgives what is without that, indicates that he is forgiven for all of these three, and then he said: Whoever does not refer to that he is not forgiven For everyone, but for each.And this face is the one who has our origins, if it is said: We do not surrender that the forgiveness indicates that it is an unimaginable torture in the hereafter, with his two, that the forgiveness is the forgiveness.And the projection of the punishment is permissible from the projection of the punishment permanently or not always, and the preserved is the one in the face of the blessed destiny.The significance in it is the righteous projection.If this is proven, then it is said: Why is it not permissible for what is meant that God is the Almighty, not delaying the hindrance of the polytheism from the world and delayed the punishment of what is without the one who is not It is said: How is this correct and we do not see more for atonement in the punishment of the world on the believers because we say: the inclusion of the verse is that God does not be late For those who follow and delay the punishment of what is wrong in the world, for those who follow, then obtain that of both the two parties by hurrying the punishment for the disbelief of the disbelief, the disbelief, the disbeliever, the disbelief, the disbelief, the disbelief, the disbelief, the disbelief, the disbelief, the disbelief It is that his punishment is accelerated, even if he does not do so with many of them.We greeted us that the forgiveness is a refrain from projection on the path of the permanent.As for the first three faces: it is a building on the origins they do not say, and it is the duty of the forgiveness of the small owner and the owner of the great after the repentance.As for the righteous face: we do not surrender that his saying: What is without that is beneficial to the general, and the evidence is that he is valid for an introduction to the word (p-145) “all” Likewise, it is said: all that is forgiven.And some of it is forgiven without that, and if it was saying: without that, he will benefit the general of what is true of that.The biggest after the repentance, and that is because the verses mentioned in the return are each one of them is a one of the sons of one of the luminaries like killing and adultery, and this is the time All of the special ticks are presented for the year.The answer to the first: If the forgiveness is carried out on the last punishment, then the ruling on the verse must be the punishment of the partners in the world more than the punishment The believers, otherwise it is not in this detailing, is a bug, and it is known that it is not as well as the evidence of its saying: And if only the people would be a mother.He disbelieves with mercy for their homes, as a silver [Al -Zukhruf: 33] verse.His saying: Why did you say if he said: What is without that the general benefit?We said: Because his saying: “What is the refer to the reference to what is described as it is without the polytheism, and this is what is one, and it has been wisely, and it is a ruling on the authority of it.A picture in which this wiper is achieved, and the forgiveness must be achieved, and it has proven that it is for the general public and because it is valid for the sake of any disobedience, and it was from the one who was from it The discretion is indicative of the general, but his saying: the verses of the return are more special than this verse, our saying: But this verse is more special than it because it is the benefit of the pardon They mentioned it to benefit the return to all, and because the verses of pardon are sought by the many for the many of the Qur’an and the news of the desire to be forgiven.The Fifth Hajj: To hold on to the generalities of the promise and it is many in the Qur’an, then we say: When the disposal is made, then it is necessary to be sought after, or from the success of the Wahwah: One of them: that the generals of the promise are more, and the risk of many evidence is considered a matter of law, and we have indicated our health in the origins of jurisprudence.And the second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: The good deeds go to the fasts [Hood: 114] indicates that goodness was a matter of goodness to the abuse of it in the form of a good Jurisprudence, so it is obligatory for this gesture to be every good deeds for every bad thing that the work of it is left in the right Their bodies are working in the rest.And the third of it: His Exalted: Whoever comes with goodness has ten times, and whoever comes to the bad, then it is only permissible for the same [Al -Anam: 160] Then he is the highest of the one who said: The seventh of Sanabel reports in every sene of a pill [Al -Baqarah: 261] Then he increased to him and said: God is double With the illness, it is only permissible for the same [Al -Anam: 160], and this is in the end of the significance that the goodness of goodness is likely to God Almighty on the side of the bad.And he seized it: He said that he said in the verse of the promise in Surah Al -Nasi: Those who believe and do the righteous, we will enter their gardens that run from under the rivers, and those who are free of them A sincere from God is a saying [Women: 122], so he said: God has really prepared, but he mentioned it to affirmation, and he did not say anything from the positions, and the Eid of God truly.As for the saying of the Exalted: What changes the saying to me [Q: 29] the verse, the promise and the supporter will be taken.Fifth: His Excellency said: And whoever does bad or or He darkens his soul, then he asks for forgiveness from God, God is forgiven, merciful, and whoever is gaining sin, but he is causing him to himself, and God is the best of God, 11 And seeking forgiveness asking for forgiveness, and it is not repentant, so he said that it is whether it was repented, or it is not obligatory.God finds a tormented torment, but he said: He is causing him himself [Women: 111], so this indicates that the side of goodness is more likely and his opponent is the saying of God: Do you improve?“ It only remembers it one time, and all of that indicates that the side of goodness is more likely.And its sixth: that we have indicated that he said: He will forgive what is without that for those who follow [Al -Nisa: 48] The single surah is two times and the return is only good for confirmation, and nothing of the verses of the return on the face of the return with one memorial, nor in a single surah, nor in a single surah, nor in a single surah, nor in a single surah, nor in a single wall On the authority of God by the authority of the promise of good deeds and forgiveness from the secrets, I am full.And its sake: that the commoners of the promise and the boundaries are what they have opposed, so it is necessary from the knowledge of the interpretation to one of the two sides, and the disclosure of the interpretation to the good is the best of the good On the authority of Al -Waqid, it is improved in the nose and the timing of the promise in the wedding, so it was the knowledge of the recitation to the return from the end of its way to the end.And the eighth: that the Qur’an is full of its vastness, forgiving forgiveness, forgiving, and that he has forgiveness and forgiveness, and that he is a generous merciful, and that he has the best, and he has forgiveness, and he has forgiveness, And the most expressive of these things has reached the level of frequency, and all of that is, which confirms the side of the promise, and not in the Qur’an that indicates that it is the same Pardon, and all of that requires the side of the promise on the side of the return.And the ninth: that this person came with what is the best of the good and it is faith and did not come with what is the ugliness of the doves, which is the infidelity, but rather it came with the evil that is in the sink of the dome in the end of the A servant, then his servant came to the great obedience and came with an intermediate disobedience, so if the birth was likely that disobedience is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one An harmful imam, so we are here, and when this was not permissible for God, it was proven that the two risks are for the advent.And I see it: Yahya ibn Mu’az Al -Razi said: If it is a one -one hour, the disbelief of five years will be destroyed, then the one is one year, how is it not a year!God, when the infidelity was not beneficial With him, something of obedience was the necessity of justice that faith does not harm anything with him than sins, otherwise the disbelief is greater than faith!If it is like that, no less than the hope of forgiveness.It is good words.Haddi is twenty: I have shown us with evidence that his saying: He forgives what is without that for those who are unjust [Women: 48] It cannot be carried on the young, nor on the one who is over.If you would not carry it over the great, before the repentance, it would be obligatory to give the verse.It is known that the specialization is lonely from delaying, the dismissed said: the prevalence of the side of the return is first of its faces: the first: that the nation agreed upon On the path of the makil and torment, and that the people of the treasury and that indicate that it is due to the punishment, and if it is attached to the punishment, it is impossible to do so in the case.For the rewards, and if you prove this, the side of the return is more likely to be on the side of the promise.As for Bayan, it is cursed, the Qur’an and consensus, but the Qur’an has said it to be exalted in the murderer of the believer: and God is angry with him and cursed him [Women: 93] The unjust [Hood: 18].[Al -Ma’idah: 38] The stroke of the way: the reward of those who fight God and His Messenger [Al -Ma’idah: 33] to his saying: This is a treasure in the world and for them in the last one.[33] And if the evildoer is proven by these attributes, it is proven that it is fulfilled for the torment and the vilification, and whoever is affected by them is always and is always a long time It is due to the reward, because (P-147) is the reward and punishment is contradictory.The head of the promise.And the second: that the verses of Al -Waad are general and the verses of the return in particular, and the private is presented over the year.And the third of it: that people were grabbed on corruption and darkness, so the need was to the mit.We said: The answer to the first of his faces: The first: As there are verses indicating that they curse and torture in the world with the causes of their transgression as well On that they glorify and honored in this world with their faith.God Almighty said: And if those who believe in our verses come to you, say peace be upon you, your Lord wrote on his soul, mercy [Al -Anam: 54], so there is no way to make the rituals of the righteous.On They glorify and torture in the world in the first place of the prevalence of the verses of the promise in the hereafter with the verses indicating that they glorify themselves in the cause of their faith in the world.The second: The verses of the promise are opposed to the verses of the return in the hereafter, it is an opposition to the verses of the return and the dependence in the world, so why did the verses and Eid al -Dunya be overwhelmed by the verses of the world From the opposite?.The third: I have gathered on the way that the shed, even if it repented, is that his hand is cut off, not a dependent, but it is a bitter, so you have proven that his saying: (A penalty of what is a lot of God: 38] The repentance, so it is not permissible for it to be a succession?It is permissible and sufficient, and it has proven that this contradicts the torment in the hereafter, and if you prove the corruption of their saying in the desirability of the side of the bond, then we say: Two struggles, so it is not possible to fulfill between them, but it is said: The servant will pray for the reward and then transfer to the house of punishment, which is a void saying that the mother of the mother is: The punishment is then transferred to the house of the reward and remains there, and it is the one who is required.The infidelity and his saying: Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger [Women: 14] All of our saying was the private and God knows best.ﷺ In the overthrow of the punishment, and that is indicated by this question.The question.You say about it and what you say about it, the verse does not indicate it?Obluing for two: one of them: if we carry it on this face, then we have carried it on all sins, without specializing in the second.He said: “And they will be given to your Lord, and they will be given to him.” His saying: Sins are forgiven, all of which is a promise that he will drop them in the future, and we will cut off that he will do so, so we will do so, so we will do so, so we will do so The Almighty will bring out the believers from the fire, not a referral, so this will be cut off from the forgiveness, not a state, and this is why it is not necessary to make the verse on the one who appears on the one This is the perfection of the words in this question, and by God the success.Let us return to the interpretation of the verse, so we say: The disgraceful, so make it possible to be the sin, surrounded by its greatness, and it is lurking for the reward of its actor, The first: (P-148): that it is as it is the condition of the osteoporosis, surrounding the human being, as it is great, so the condition of this surrounding is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the condition of this surrounding Pardon is achieved, as the matter is achieved by a person, then if the place of the bad does not prove, surrounding the human being, unless it is proven, and this is the one who is the one who is the one The recipient of this verse stands on the evidence of the one who is repeated while it is invalid.The second: We do not explain the surrounding of the sin in its large being, but we can explain it that it is its appearance and its inner is described by the disobedience, and it is in disobedience.He who is a disobedient to God with his heart, his tongue and his wings, as for the Muslim who is obedient to God with his heart and his tongue and he will be a sinner Some of us do not fulfill the surrounding of the sin with the servant, and there is no doubt that the interpretation of the surrounding is what we mentioned first, because the body, if it touches some parts of the part of the part It is surrounded by it, and when this appears that the surrounding of the sin does not achieve the servant unless it is an infidel.If this is proven, then we say his saying: Those are the people of the fire, it requires that the people of the fire are not only, and that is required that it is not the owner of the great.The third: that his saying is up to the Almighty: Those who are the people of the fire requires their being in the fire at once and that is false, so it is necessary to carry it on that they deserve the fire.And we say with it: but there is no conflict in that it is exaggerated, they are forgiven for this truth, and this is the first question, and let us be sealed in this thing, which is this The condition is two things: one of them: the reception of the bad.The second: the surrounding of that badness with the servant, and the penalty related to the existence of the two conditions is not found when one of them is obtained.This indicates that the one who sought the right to two parties is in divorce or fear that he does not come out with the existence of one of them and God knows.
