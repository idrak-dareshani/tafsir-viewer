The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: that is a nation that has been given to it what it has earned and for you what you have earned and do not ask what they were doing.With this verse for a wagon: one of them: to be a preaching of them and a dirt until they do not speak to the grace of parents, each one is taken with his work.And the second: that it is exalted, indicating that when it is not denying that you are my unification, their satisfaction is to disturb the reconciliation, it is not denying that you are dispersed by the poems of you.Another boredom.And the third of it: It is upset when he mentioned the goodness of the prophet who mentioned them in these verses, indicating that the evidence is not fulfilled by that, but every human being He has the right to leave the right to be deluded that he is holding a way to the way of those who were presented, because they were afflicted or made a mistake that does not benefit these and does not harm them.Recruitment, if it was said, why did you repeat the verse?We said in it, saying: One of them is that it is the first verse of Ibrahim Al -Jubai said: The judge said: This is a distance because the ancestors of Jews and the Christians did not have a masculinity and a place of suspicion in this saying that the people of the people who said: Hood, as if they said: They were like the way of our ancestors from the Jews, so their predecessors became in the ruling of the remembrances, so he did not say: That is the nation That is, such as arbitrariness, but the precedent mentioned is Abraham and his sons.And the second saying: when the abusers, the conditions, and the citizens did not disagree, the righteousness was a vast, as if it is up to the Almighty, he said: This is nothing but a good, and it is the same as the one who is the good Religion does not justify the conventional in this race, so you should leave the words in that nation, so it is what it has gained and look at what you called for you, and you are the one who is for you, for you, for you You only ask about your work.His Excellency said: The fools will say from the people what they have before them, who were on which they were said to God, the Mustark and the Wester The second suspicion of the similarity that the Jews and the Christians mentioned in Islam, and they said: The copies require either ignorance or the absence, and both of them are not given, and they do not know That it is free from the restriction, or that it is a restriction without permanent, or that it is restricting the rest of the permanent, if it is free from the arrest, it is not necessary, but it is not.It will be the arrival of the matter after that, and if it is restricted to the restriction of the people, then it is clear that it is the one who is the one after it, and it is not for it, and it is not for it, and it is not.Restricted with the rest of the permanent, if the matter is in it that it is permanently remaining with the fact that he mentioned a memory that indicates that he remains permanently, then he raised it, then he was fool It has been for him, and if he is a scientist that he does not always remain with it that he mentioned a memory indicating that he was always always a matter Attention and they are referred to God Almighty, so the copying of it was referred to it, so it comes to the transcription in the rulings of God Almighty that (P-83) must be invalidated, so it is the same.Just in the copying of the kiss to the stabbing in Islam, then they devoted this image to the increasing likeness The interests are equal in the fact that it is for God to be exalted and created for Him, so the kissing of the kiss from the side of a verb is free from the reconciliation, so it is not the reason, so it is not the good, so it is not the good This indicated that this change is not from God Almighty, so they connected to this face to the stabbing in Islam.And we will now speak to the interpretation of the province, then let us remember the answer to this suspicion on the face that God has decided in his book.* * * As for his saying: The fools will say in his saying: The first is: It is the choice of the lock that this is the memorial, even if the one who is accepted is a phenomenon, but it is not the same Like a man, he does a work, and he will be stabbed in it.They mentioned it once, and they will remember it after that once, and it is correct for this interpretation to be said: The fools will say that the people of the people have said, That is the revelation of the verse.The second saying: that God is upholstered before them before they remember these words that they will remember Him and in which he is a good: one of them is that he is the one who is peace and peace be upon him.Its fall, this was a news about the absence, and it would be a miracle.And the second: It is up to the first and then he hears it from them, then it will harm him from this words less than if he hears it from them first.And the third of it: that God is exalted, if he hears it first and then mentioned his answer with him, then when the Prophet will hear him, peace and blessings be upon him, then the answer is present.The answer is present, and the shed in the origin of the language, we have explained it in the interpretation of its saying, the Almighty: They said that I believe as the righteousness of the cow: Between what he has and on him, and amends his benefits to what he is harmful, describes with lightness and foolishness, and there is no doubt that the mistake in the door of religion is the greatest of harm in it On the basis of opinion It is clear in his world, he is one of his worlds The participants and the hypocrites, and on their sentences, and he went to every one of these face Jews, and that because they were forgetting the attachment of the Messenger to them in the kiss, they thought that his agreement was for them in the kiss, perhaps they would not call him until they called him until they called him until they called him until they were called In the kidney, when it was transferred from that kiss, they were grateful from that and they were clouded and said: He returned to the way of his fathers, and I miss their religion, and if he had been Perhaps we know that the awaited messenger preached to him in the delegation, so they said: God has told them in this verse.Second: Ibn Abbas and Al -Abrai ibn Azib, Al -Hassan, and Deaf, said that they are the shared of the Arabs, and that is because he was praying and peace be upon him.And the participants used to harm him because of that, so when he came to the city and turned into the kaaba, they said: I prayed only the return to our attachments, and if it is for him.And the third of it: that they are the hypocrites and it is the saying of the sedity, and these are mentioned, that is a mockery from where it is not distinguished by some (P-84) from the sake of some The kissing of the kiss to it, so this was the exaggeration of the messenger and the work with the opinion and the desire, but we carried us to memorize the fools on the opponent, because this is the opponent, because this is the opponent.With them, God Almighty said: Except that they are the fools, but they do not know [the cow: 13].And its booster: that it enters in it all because the utterance of the fools has been preserved in which the people entered the thousand and the blame, and it was clear that it was clear to all the disbelievers in the mind And the text is also indicated by it, and it is his saying: And whoever desires the religion of Abraham, except for those who shed his soul [Al -Baqarah: 130], then he must be taken.The judge said: What is meant by the verse is that the words of these words from them in the sentence, and if it is also the claim of the uncle in it after our saying: This destiny does not contradict the uncle, nor does the uncle do not.Rather, the closeness is that everyone has said that, because the most prominent people are on the authority of praise and stabbing.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: What they have before their kisses, who were on them, and he has books: The first question: He was his behavior from him, and for him to him, and to him with his success.His saying: And whoever takes them on the day of his arrangement [Al -Anfal: 16] and his saying: What they have gone on to understand the sides of the mockery and admiration.The second question: In this atheism and Jahan: The first face: It is the most popular collected upon the interpreters: it is that it is When the kiss turned into the Kaaba from the house of the sanctuary, the blame of the Muslims, and they said: What they have before their kisses, which they were in which they have been said to him For the Messenger and the believers, and the kiss that they were on the house Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, after a period of ten months or ten months, and from Mu’az after three ten months, and from the mourning Abbas and Al -Abrai Bin Aazib after seventy months, and this saying was proven by us from the quarrels of the sayings and from some of them, the twelve of the one who said: The kiss was shown on the day of the two half of the nose of the seventh of the seven months, and others said: but two years.The second face: The saying of my father is a Muslim, which is that when the news was correct that God Almighty turned him from the house of the sanctuary to the Kaaba, it is necessary for him to say, and if there is no saying, and for him, and if he said, and if he said, and for him, and if he said: It is intended to say that they were on it, that is, the fools were on it, so they were not known except before the Jews and the kiss of the Christians, so the first to the Maghrib and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.With the prayer until they turn to something of the flaws, when they saw the Messenger of God ﷺ he was married to the kaaba, it was that of them, and they said: These two sides are the two parties, so God said, "He said to them: Say to God, the Mudharq and the Wester The saying is an imprisoned, and God knows.The third question: Al -Qafal said: The kiss is the one that the human being accepted, and it is from the opposite, but the kiss was called before, because the one is met, because it is the same, because it is the same, because the prayer is that the prayer is.Qartb said: They say in their words, it is not for a kiss, that is, he does not have a person who is shelter to it, and it is also taken from the ritual, and he said: Each one of them is a kiss for the other, and some of the speakers said: (P-85) ؎ I made you a decision for me and a kiss, wherever I resorted to the saying of God: And the strange thing is that this is the first answer to that suspicion, and it is reported that all the flaws of God are king and king, so it is not worthy of it for the same Rather, it becomes a kiss because God Almighty has made it a kiss, and if the matter is like that, then he does not condemn it to transform it from one side to the other side, then what is the one who said: Awareness of the kiss?Then the rule in the conversion of the kiss from one side to the side?We said: As for the first question, it is the most severe disagreement among the people of the Sunnah The reasons for the rulings of God are the highest of the bit, and they needed it with his faces: one of them: that everyone who did action for a sacrament, so that it is the existence of it, and there is no existence, and there is no existence.Either that it is not like that, but the existence and the numbers are the same as the same, if it was the first, it was deficient for its own self -associated It is impossible to be a suppression, a cross and a prestigious, then it was said: If it is his existence and its numbers with the lineage to it on the level, except that it was not for him, but it was not for him, but he was not.His numbers, for the wise does to do it to go back to others.Likewise, then the division will come back.Second: That everyone who did a verb for a metaphor is either that it is valid for the acquisition of that offer without that mediator, or it is not possible for him to be.That medium is vast, and if the second was a cushion, and he is referred to God.And the third of it: that if he did a verb for the sake of the sake, then that is the present.Another, and the rotation or sesulus is obligatory.And he paid it: to specialize the events of the world with a certain time without what he accepted and what is after him if it had a rule that he has sealed with that time without what he did.This rule did not happen in that time without the captives of the hamat, such as asking the cause that the world did not happen in that time without the brochures of the halls.If one of them sought advantage of the most likely, then the other, and if it is agreed, then the other is, and if this does not stop, then the rule of the rule, then it is a long time And the syntax.Fifth: What was previously made of evidence is that all of the women are good and evil, disbelief and faith, obedience and disobedience and fall into the capacity of God, the Almighty, and the Almighty, Because it is impossible for God to be a supply that will return to the servant in the creation of the disbelief in it and its dissolution on it, the Abad.And its sixth: that the power of God is attached to and its purpose to find the verb appointed in the eternal, either that it is permissible or obligatory, if it is an outstanding, it is not possible Single, and because it requires the validity of the numbers on the validity, and if it is obligatory, the duty is not obligatory, so you have proven to us with this face that you are the most important of God And the purposes are referred, and if it is also the act of divine, power, enforcement, and seizure, and this is the one who indicates that he said: P-86) (P-86) The desertion and the western, for it is the reason for the copying of the copy.And the Moroccan, and the king returns to the capacity to the capacity, and that is not the same as the rule of what the disgrace says, so you have proven that this is the same.And we went, but the disgraceful, they said: When the evidence indicated that it is a wise up, and the wise is not permissible to be his actions free from the purposes, knowing it, His actions and his rulers are wisdom and purposes, then it is a tire that is an apparent phenomenon for us, and a hidden hidden from us, and the kissing of the kiss from one side to one side to the one To be a hidden reconciliation and the stretched secrets from us, and if the matter is like that: it is impossible to stab with this conversion in the religion of Islam.The following question: In the words in that judgment on the way of detail, and know that the proverbs of these permissible do not be a piece, but I will meet it.As for those who kissed in prayer, they have mentioned in it a ruling: one of them: that God Almighty created in the human being a mindful and perceived of the rituals, and the misery of the misery, Shortly in the world of bodies, and the mind of the mental power is removed from the comparison of the fictional power and its accompanying, then if the human being wants to bring the mind of the mind of the mind He puts a fictional image for him that it is calculated until that fictional image is appointed to the realization of those mental suffering, and that is for that, then the one who does not want to be.The rulings of the quadruples, and put a clear image for him and a certain form to become a sense of sense and imagination are appointed to the mind in the realization The September of the Great King, for it is inevitable and that he accepts it in his face, and that it is not exposed to it, and that it is overburdened with the praise of it, and it is in the tongue of it, For him, he will be upset with the kiss in the prayer, the course of his universe is accepted by the king, not exposed to it, and the readers and the praises are running the path of praise, and the ritual of the ritual, the ritual of praise, the ritual of praise, the ritual of praise, the ritual of praise, and the rituals The course of servants.And the second: that the one who is intended from the prayer is the presence of the heart, and this presence is only with the tranquility and the leaving of the fools and the movement, and this does not come unless it remains in the whole in the whole For one side of the two awareness, if some of the flaws are more honorable in the illusions, then the one was upset.And the third of it: God Almighty loves the attachment and the familiarity between the believers, and he has mentioned the load to them, where he said: And God bless you.[231] His saying: a brother, and if each one is directed in his prayers to another side, then that was the illusion of a disagreement, so he appointed God, the Almighty, and the authority of them In the face, it is like it, so that they will be attached to them because of that, and in it Referring to the fact that God Almighty loves the agreement between His worshipers in the best of good.And its elevation: that God Almighty summed up the Kaaba by adding it to him in his saying: My house [Al -Baqarah: 125] And the believers specialized in their addition, with the sake To specialize and honorable, as if he is the Almighty, he said: O believer, you are my servant, and the kaaba is my house, and the prayer is my servant, so I will accept your face in my servant, and to my servants.Fifth: Some of the sheikhs said: The Jews received the kiss, because the call to the peace of peace be upon him came from him, and that is his saying: and what was the one who was in the authority of God: [44] The verse, and the Christians received the Moroccan, because Jabril, peace be upon him, was gone to Mary, peace be upon him, on the authority of the Mashriq, for his saying: She was discharged from her family, an outstanding place [Maryam: 16] and the believers received the kaaba because it was before the Khalil of God, and the birth of Habib (p-87) (P-87) God, and some of them said: I received the Christians, the lights were received, and we have received us, the master of the lights, and he is Muhammad, who is the light of the light.And its sixth: They said: The Kaaba is the secret of the earth and its mediator, so God commanded all of his creation by winging up to the ground in their prayers, and it is a sign of that For his sake, he made the ground before the creation.And the sake of it: that he has appeared his love for Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, by the authority of his command, with the righteousness For the sake of the violation of the Jews, God Almighty revealed: We have seen your face and your face in the sky [the cow: 144] the verse, and in the witness if one described one of the people of the people: The kiss is transferred for the sake of so -and -so on the side of the representation, for God Almighty has transformed the kiss for the sake of his love, peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.Let us give you a kiss that you will accept [the cow: 144] and he did not say before it is satisfied, and the sign is in it as if it is up to the Almighty, he said: O Muhammad, every one who asks for my consent, As for the world, this is what we mentioned, and in the hereafter, the Almighty said: and for your Lord, your Lord will be given, and you are satisfied [Al -Duha: 5] in which there is a sign that also to the honor So you will be among the unjust [Al -Anam: 52] and he said in the symptoms about the kiss: And if you follow their whims after what came to you from the knowledge that you are the one who is the oppressor, then he said: Before your face, and the poor before my mercy, so your symptoms are before your face, and your being is unjust, for symptoms are before me.And eighth: the throne is the kiss of the bear, the Kerosi before the righteousness, and the house is the kiss of the travel, and the kaab [Translation failed: Request exception can happen
