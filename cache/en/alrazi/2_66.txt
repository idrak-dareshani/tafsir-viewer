The researcher is the Almighty: You have taught those who have been accustomed to you in the Sabbath, so we said to them that they were a piercing, and we made it a stubbornness and what is between it and what is between it For the righteous (P-102), know that it is up to the number of its faces, the first of which is the first of them, so that it was the same as the one who directed them, and this is the one who is the first Issues: The first question: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that these people were in the time of peace be upon him, peace be upon him, on the souven of the sea between the sea, between the soup of the city The two whales are gathered in it from every earth in a month of the Sunnah until the water is not seen because of its many and otherwise that month in every special curse is the village of the remote.The village that was present at the sea, as they prepared in the Sabbath [Al -Araf: 163], and they were embraced by the sea, and they made it to them.On the day of the one, then this is the love in the menstruation is their accusation, then they took the thickness and took advantage of that while they were disobedient from the holy one, so when the covenant was given to the father And take the money, and he walked to them as the people of the city who have repeated the hunter on the day of the Sabbath and ended them.With him except for good, and he said to them: Do not be deceived, and may God be tormented with you, so the people became a loudar, and they are a larger, so they are three of you.The second question: the intended is the remembrance of this story: Those who were in the time of Muhammad, peace be upon him, when he told them Muhammad, peace be upon him, on this exist That is on the authority of peace be upon him, but he knew him from the revelation.The second: It is upset when he told them what he treated with the companions of the Sabbath, as if he says to them.With the redemption of you, and its counterpart is the Almighty saying: Oh those who have given the book, believe in what we have come to believe in what is before you, so that we have before you Her dubbing [women: 47].The third question: the words are deleted, as if he said: And you have learned from those who have been accustomed to you in the Sabbath, so that the one is removed from the mind, for the sake The darkening indicates that the one who did it in the Sabbath was forbidden to them, and the separation of that is not mentioned in this verse, but it is a remembrance of it The village that was present at the sea [Al -Arif: 163] Then it is possible to say: They are enemy in that way of only, and it is said: They are enemy because they hunted with them that they were broken.The following question: The owner of the scout said: The Sabbath is the source of the sacrifice, if the day is greedy.If it was said: When God was forbidden from the hunting on the day of the Sabbath, then the ruling is that the most whales on the day of the Sabbath without the days of the days as he said: They cursed them as a law and a day that they do not give them, as well as their nobles [Al -Arif: 163] Is this only the excitement of temptation and the will to deliver.We said: As for the people of the Sunnah, the reason for the misguidance is brought from God Almighty, and as for the division of the disgrace, the tension in the crocodile is good for the reward.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: We told us that they are a loud monkey, who have angios: Quarter and misfortune, which is young and ritual.(P-103) The second question: Its exalted: Being a pierce is not a matter of no matter because they were not able From it the speed of formation, as the Almighty saying: We say something to something if we want it to say to him, be it, so it will be [the bee: 40] and the words of it: [It was separated: 11] The meaning is that it was not exaggerated by what he wanted to remove from the aging in the hearts, but rather what he said to them; Being a piercing, and they became like that, that is, when he wanted that with them, they became as he wanted while he said: As we cursed the companions of the Sabbath, and the command of God is the one who did not: [47] Also, God speaks to that with this formation, but the influenced in this formation is the ability and will.If it was said: when this saying was not a effect on forming, then what is the benefit in it?We said: As for us, the rulings of God Almighty and his acts do not stop at the sponsorship of the reconciliation of the bit, but at the time of the disgrace, perhaps this is the saying The angels or their others.The third question: The narrator of Mujahid is that it is his pursuit and the transcendence He carries travel [Al -Juma: 5] and his counterpart is to say the professor to the learner in which he does not succeed in his learning: be a ritual.And he was invoked by his abstinence with two things: The first: that the human being is this witnessed and the perceived structure.For a human being and finding the core, so he will return the mutation on this saying that he is the highest of the symptoms that were adopted by those bodies, and the symptoms were in them.I was a monkey, so this It is a plural and creation, not that it is a dirty.The second: If we have been blessed, we have not been in all that we see as a monkey and a dog that he was a rational human, and that is leading to doubt in the scenes.And it is answered from the first that the human being is not the completeness of this hook, and that is because this person may become a heat after it was a meager, and the opposite is the same The appointed is the one who was supplied and the rest is not the same, for the human being is behind this perceived dog, and that is either that it is a valid body in the body or the part As a heart, a brain, or a stretching, and a murder that the philosopher says, and all of the capabilities, so there is no abuse in the meeting of that thing with the absence of this.The dirty, and with this estimation, it is permissible in the king, whose corpses are in the end of the greatness to enter the stone of the Messenger, peace be upon him.On the second that safety is obtained by the nation’s gatherings, and when it was proven by what we decided to be the mutation of the mutation, the verse could be made on its appearance, and it was not a need for us to do so that it is a need for us.May God have mercy on him, even if what was mentioned is not very followed; Because if a human being, if he insults his ignorance after the appearance of the verses and the evacuation of the evidence, it is said in the back of the back.In the destiny, it is a warning.There are two questions: the first question: that after he becomes a monkey who does not have a understanding, no reason, no knowledge, no knowledge, so he does not know what we have come from, and the deceased A painful manner that the penalty is the state of its peace, it is not possible, so whoever comes to torment by its causes?.Answer: Why is it not permissible to say: The matter that the human being is a rational person, so he was understanding that it was left, except that when the creation and the image changed, there was no generosity that it was not.The humanitarian deeds and acts of the human being, but it was defining the change in the creation, due to the disobedience of disobedience, and it was in the end of the fear and the sins, and it was a good.The change of these members and is not necessary from the abundance of the original penalty with that image of the immersion of the human being in that imperfection that is strange, the second.(P-104).The monkey remained, or God, and if we say that they remained, this is the monkey who is in our time, is it permissible to say: It is whoever forgot the first of those who are not?.Answer: Everyone is a mind, except that the narration is from Ibn Abbas that they did not abandon only three days, then they will.The loyal question: The people of the language said: The miserable one who is the one who walked like the dogs if we approached people, then he was said to him, and that is, and he is a municipality, and this is not a little Your positions, God Almighty said: The eyesight will turn to you, and it is a miserable and he is a good one [the king: 4] Futures, then return the eyesight, kneel two, and the optics turn to you, and it is a sense of sight, as if he said: He repeated the eyesight in the sky.That did not find a breakthrough, so your kindness will be exalted to you, as the disobedient is after the length of his endeavor to seek something and do not blow it up, for it is the one who is wrapped in it Where he intended him to return it.As for his saying: We made it, and they have disagreed that this is the opposite to anything that comes back to faces: one of them: the deceased said: “We made it” means the mutilation.And the second: Al -Akhfash said: That is, we made the monkey a neck.And the third of it: we made the village of the siblings.And its elevation: He made this nation a neck because his saying is up to the Almighty: and you have learned from those who have been accustomed to you in the Sabbath, indicating the nation and the group or the one who is the one who is the one who is the first Because if he can return the kinna to a present mentioned, then it is not directed to return it to the other, then it is not in the advanced verse, except for their remembrance and the remembrance of the mind of the mind.The lock, may God have mercy on him: It is the righteous, deterred for people for the feet of such as that disobedience, and its origin is from the prohibition and the love of the The abstinence is from it, and it is said to the entry of the royalty, and the absurd abuse is also a crying because of the prohibition and the love, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: that it is the same: And God Almighty said: God is more bad and more affordable [Al -Nasa: 84] and the meaning: We made what happened to these people, a deterrent, deterred to others, for the other The Adamians mean it from the recovery, because that is what is harmful to the ticks and decreases from its king The worshipers are our punishment and a preacher.The stroke, the insisting, is a penalty and a stack, and he wanted it to do the face of insult and dehydration.When what was revealed by the people of the people who took advantage of the Sabbath and was broken from the guidance of the whales, and other things that were forbidden by them, they were forbidden from them, and they were from the one who had been eliminated, So he indicated that he was upset with them with a wise man, not on the face of reconciliation, because he was not obeyed to reduce the amount At the cost of changed diseases For the images, and it is a municipality, not a punishment, so he explained the Almighty saying: So we made it a declaration that it was the highest, so it was a punishment for what was from them.As for the saying of the Almighty: for what is between her hands and what is left behind, he has faced it: one of them: for what he accepted and what is with it and what is after the nations and the centuries, because it is the one who has been mentioned in the first So consider it and consider those who have reached it, the news of this occurrence from the others.And the second: I want what is between the pods and the nations.And the third of it: What is meant is that he made it a punishment for all (P-105), committed it from this act and after it, and it is the saying of good.As for his words, the Exalted: It is preached to the righteous, and he is in his faces: He descends like what he descended from, and if he does not go down urgent, then he must be afraid of the later punishment that is the greatest and an edema.As for the derivative of those who fear the masculinity, it is the same as what he has shown in the first Surah when he said: He is guided by those who are righteous, because if they are seized and preached to the And the benefit is that they are reconciled to them; Because it is not a benefit for others.The second: that the meaning of its saying is: and a preaching for the righteous that the righteous people will exhort each other, that is, we made it a bit, and it will be exalted, and the one who has been exalted, so that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who preached to it.The preaching is added to the righteous in the sense that they are exhumed with it, and this is especially for them without others who are righteous, and God knows best.
