The Qur’anic researcher is the third in the wine, they ask you about the wine and the easy.The wine and the facilitator say that there is a great sin and the benefits of people and their singer is greater than their benefit.It is impeded that they asked about his truth and what it is, and it is enticed that they asked about the solution of the benefit of it, and it is enticed that they asked about the solution of it.When he replied with the remembrance of the sanctity, he would have specialized the answer to that question was that it was signed by the solution and the prohibition.In the verse: the first question: they said: The four verses were descended in the wine, and it came down with the Mecca of the saying of the Almighty: And from the fruits of the palm trees and the domains, it is made from it.Well [the bee: 67] and the Muslims were drinking it and it is permissible for them, then “Omar and Muharz and alienated from the companions, they said: O Messenger of God, we will give us in the wine.For the mind, it is a sympathy for the money.Bin Awf are people from them, so drink and sugar, so some of them prayed and read: Say: O disbelievers, worship what you worship.43] He said whoever drinks it, then the people of the supporters gathered, and they were happy with the son of Abi Waqqa, so when they were drunk, they were taken and sought the poems until I am noticeable, so I will seek the sake For the supporters, a supporter of a camel was struck by a camel, and he made a shivering shivering, and he walked to the Messenger of God.The wine and the facilitator [Al -Maaidah: 90] to his saying: So you are over.Al -Qafil, may God have mercy on him, said: The rule in the prohibition of this is the prohibition that God Almighty knew that the people had been in the heart of the drink, and the drink of the wine, He knew that if he had prevented them from a single payment, it was hard for them to do so, so there is no crime, so he used to prohibit this trend, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: And the facilitator with this verse, then the words of the Almighty descended: Do not bring the prayer and you are my drivers [Al -Nasa: 43] So you are required to prohibit the drinking of the time and the time Because the mustache of wine could only pray with the sugar, so it was forbidden to prevent from drinking, and then the verse of the extended was descended in The prohibition, and on the authority of Al -Rabi` ibn Anas that this verse was descended after the wine was forbidden.* * * The second question: I know that this verse is indicative of the deprivation of wine, so we turn to Bayan that the wine is what he?Then to Bayan that this verse indicates the prohibition of the drink of wine.(P-36) As for the first place: in Bayan, the wine is what?Al -Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, said: Every drink is sugar, and it is a wine, and Abu Hanifa said: The wine is a dilemma from the juice of the hardship, which was slandered.The argument of the Shafi’i on his saying is his faces: one of them: what Abu Dawood narrated in his “Sunnah”: On the authority of the people of Ibn Omar, may God be pleased with them, he said: He descended from five: from grapes, dates, bowls, barley, and atom, and wine is not the ruler It was informed that the wine was deprived of the day it was deprived and it was taken from the bow and the barley, as it was taken from the grapes and the dates, and this indicates that they were.And the second: that he said: The wine was forbidden on the day of the forbidden, and it is taken from these wine things, and this is like the permissibility that the deprivation of the wine is eaten.And the third of it: that Omar, may God be pleased with him, attached to it all that the mind is from drinking, nor was it doubtful that Omar was a scholar of the language, and his narration is that the wine is the name He changed it.The second pilgrimage: Abu David narrated from Al -Naaman ibn Bashir, may God be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: From the righteousness is wine, and from the barley is excessive, “and the one who is inherent in it is one of them: one of them: that this is clear in that these things are within the name of the name The indication of the prohibition of wine.The second: It is not the intense of the streets, the knowledge of the languages, so it is obligatory to be his intention of that, with the fact that the ruling that is fixed in the wine is fixed in it, or the righteousness, or the ruling, The wine is concluded with it is the prohibition of drinking, and it is necessary to be steadfast in this drink.For the sake of that the wine is only from this fifth with its signs, but its remembrance was created in particular; To make it with a testimony in that time, all of the atom, compassion, or tree of a tree, is a tree, and its judgment is the ruling of this fifth, as it is the one that is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the fifth, as it is the one that is the one who is the fifth, as it is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the fifth, as well as By mentioning in the news of usury, it is not forbidden from the confirmation of the ruling of usury, otherwise.The third pilgrimage: Abu Dawid also narrated from the exile from Ibn Omar, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: Peace: “Every inhibitor is a wine” The prohibition of wine, and it was The name of the wine is unaware of the people who are good from the street that it is said: God's intending is the Almighty from this memorization.To place a legal name on the path of events as in prayer and fasting and others.And the other face: that it is meaning that it is like wine in the sanctity; And that is because his saying this is wine, so the achievement of this memory is beneficial to its soul in itself, for if it is a sign of that, that it is a miracle that is forbidden.In judgment, which is the characteristic of that thing.The fourth Hajj: Abu Dawid narrated on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that she said: The piety is a drink that is taken from the honey, in which the heroes of every one is mentioned by the companions of the solution of the stinging, and the corruption of the saying of those who said: The few who are permissible; Because peace be upon him was asked about a single type of discourse, and he answered him by prohibiting gender, and he enters into it the few and many of it, and if there was a thing, and if there is a thing) Its types and quantities mentioned it and did not neglect it.The Fifth Hajj: Abu Dawid narrated from Jabir bin Abdullah, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: The sixth pilgrimage: It was also narrated on the authority of Aisha, she said: I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ saying: Al -Khattabi: “The difference,” is a meant man who can be sixteen, and in it, Abu al -Bayyan is that the sanctity is comprehensive for all the parts of the drink.The seven argument: Abu Dawid narrated on the authority of Shahr ibn Hushab, on the authority of the mother of Salamah.A drink that inherits the mortality and the abundance in the members, and this is not doubt that it is a transcendent of all kinds of gratitude, so all the hadiths are all indicated that every sugar is a wandering.* * * The second type of indications is that every wine is a wine: the consequences of the insults, the people of the language said: The origin of this hydration is covered, the name of the trait; Because it covers the head of the woman, and the wine is what I have seen from the trees and others, from the gift and the gift, and I am exaggerated the head of the vessel, that is, his coverage, and the ruler is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: She was named wine; Because it is the mind of the mind, that is, its mixture, it is said: it is the disease of the disease if it is mixed, and he sought to be a sinner: a murky murmur is unlike a miserable disease, and it is said: the ruler of the bond.It was mentioned by the first; Because the thing, if the mixture of the thing, becomes the house of the rhetoric for it, then this detence indicates that the wine is what is a hoop for the mind, as it is called, as it is called.The mind is that you do it, and if it is It was called the source from its wine if it will be given to the vineyard, and he returns it to the fact that the wine is the sugar; Because the sugar covers the mind, and is prevented from the prayers of its light to the members, so this is the most stronger of the strongest indications that the name of the wine is the sugar, then the conversation, then it is the same.The many to it is not said: This is a proof of the language with the measure, and it is not permissible; Because we say: This is not a proof of the language with the measurement, but it is the appointment of the name of this mediation of this insults, as the companions of Abu Hanifa, the mercy The marriage is slow and proven by the inspections, and the name of the fast is the constipation, and they prove it with the insults.* * * The third type of evidence indicating that the wine is the sugar: that the nation is collected on that the verses mentioned in the wine are three, and two of them are in response.One of them is this verse, and the second is the verse of the extended, and the third is returned in the sugar, and it is his saying: Do not bring the prayer and you are a wicked [the women: 43] Sukil.* * * The one who is the fourth of the pilgrimage: that the prohibition of wine is that “Omar and Mu’az said: O Messenger of God, the wine is a dumping of the mind, for the sake of our mind In it.So they are the fatwa from God and His Messenger in the cause of the vineyard of wine in order to be a mind, so it is obligatory to be everything that was equal to the wine in this wine in this matter.To be equal to wine in this wisdom.* * * (P-38) The fifth type of argument: that God is the same as the deprivation of the wine by saying the exalted And it will repel you from the remembrance of God and the prayer [Al -Mawdidah: 91] and there is no doubt that these actions are treated with sugar, and this is the reason for me, so this is what is this The deprivation of wine is treated by being a sugar, but that the piece is obligatory that all the drunkenness is a wine, and if it is not like that, then this is not the case of this.And everyone who described and left the stubbornness, know that these faces are a phenomenon that is a majestic in this way.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, is one of them: one of them: His Exalted: It is the fruits of the palm tree and the tubes, you take from it a sugar and the abundance of goodness [67] We have to take sugar and good asceticism, and we do not have good sugar and livelihood, so it is obligatory to be permissible; Because the age is only permissible.The second Hajj: Ibn Abbas narrated, “He has to pray and peace be upon him.He said: What are the people?His face and his response, and Al -Abbas said: O Messenger of God, you spoil the people of the Mecca of their drink.And he said: They responded to the praise, and they returned it to him, so they called with a water from Zamzam, and he stabbed him and drank, and he said: If this is overwhelmed by this, the drink is broken.The reciprocate of it is that the polarization is only from the hardship; The third pilgrimage: holding the effects of the companions.You said: That sugar and goodness are good, this is the prophet?So these three were either people, or specialized for it.To the beacon, and the sacrifice of peace be upon him was in the end of the kindness, and the generous bowl did not need that food, so this was put in its face, and the water was in the water.That is the destiny of the outfit or the wind, and the sentence, every sane person knows that the symptoms of that indicators that we have mentioned with this destiny are from the one The companions are an opposing anti -action, so it is necessary to leave it and the return to the appearance of the book of God and the Sunnah of the Messenger, peace be upon him, so this is the words in the truth.This verse is indicative of the prohibition of wine, and its two faces: the first: that the verse indicates that the wine is covered by the ingredient, and the righteousness is forbidden; The Lord of the Al -Fawash, what appeared from it, and what was stomed, the sin, and the prostitute [Al -Araf: 33] So the group of these two verses was indicative of the deprivation of the wine.It is intended for what is entitled to the punishment of sins, and any of them was not correct to describe it except the forbidden.Singing the sin and punishment, and that is required to be prohibited.(P-39).Why did you say: The drinking of the wine was when it was in it that in which there is a forbidden person?What is meant is that that sin is obligatory for all the ability, so the drinking of wine was obligated to this mandarin, and the forbidden, and the obligatory The drink is forbidden, and among them He said: This verse does not indicate the sanctity of the wine, and it was transmitted with it with its faces: one of them: that it is the highest in which it has been proven to the people of the people, and the forbidden is not.The second: If this verse indicated its prohibition, then they would not be convinced of it until the verse of al -Maaidah and the verse of the prohibition of prayer were descended?The third: It is the highest that it is a great sin, so it was required that that great sin is that it will be the ones as long as it is a meant.It is obligatory to say that it was forbidden in the brigades of the partnership.The answer to the first: that the urgency of the hurry in it in the world is not prevented from being forbidden, and when it was like that, it was not the right to the benefit of them; Because the private sincerity requires the truth of the year.The answer is about the second: We narrated from Ibn Abbas that it was descended in the prohibition of wine, and the endowment that I mentioned is unwillingly from them, and it is possible that it is possible We will go away from this verse in the prohibition, as Abraham, may God’s prayers be upon him, is touched by the view of the mortal neighborhoods to increase the silence and the inhabitants.The answer is about the third: that his saying: they have a great sin of news about the situation, not about the past, and when God Almighty knows that the drink of the wine is in the time of the time of the time of the time, and the time of the time is that of the time of the time.It was spoiled for those who were before this nation.This is the completeness of the words in this section.* * * The third question: in the right of the facilitator, then we say: the facilitator is the breadwinner, a source of accessible as the one who is appointed and the reference from their actions, it is said: it is said: In his derivation on his faces: one of them: a fighter said: I derive it from the secret; Because he took the mantle of the man with an easy and easy one who is almost and did not play, they were saying: They were pleased with us of the validity of the wonders, or from the right; Because he caused his journey, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas: the man in the ignorance was risked on his family and money.And the second: Ibn Qatibah said: The facilitator of fragmentation and sharing, it is said: they are pleased with the thing, that is: it is divided, for the souls of itself calls a brochure; Because it is fragmented by parts, as if it is the position of fragmentation, and the graying of the gags; Because it is fragmented by the flesh of the islands, then it is said to the two rituals with praise and oppression on the islands: they are Yassron; Because they are of that action they divide the flesh of the islands.And the third of it: The one said: It is one of their saying: it is easy for me to make it easy and easy if it is obligatory, and the obligatory is due to the grace of the righteousness, this is the word.As for the description of the facilitator, the owner of the “scout” said: I had ten days, which are the gossip and the pens: the feat, the mortality, the sophistication, and the sweetness, with the openness of the H, the lame, the captain, the high, the competitors, the praise, and the aroma, And the clouds, each of which has a share known from the islands they fill and divide them ten parts, and it was said: eight and twelve parts, but three, And the boom, and the bone in this sense is a poetry: (p-40) ؎ in the world, there are arrows that there is no Lord in them, and they are their lords, and tomorrow, and the softening of the people, and the sake of the sake, The downs, for the nickname three, for the sitting for four, and for five competitors, and for the Sabbath for six, and for the seven, they make it in the ribbed Justice, then he shall sitting and entering his hand, and he will be brought out in the name of a man who is praise from her, so whoever comes out to him is a praise of the hearts, he takes the nap, and he is the same He came out for him a praise that we did not share for him, and he did not take anything, and he fond of the validity of all of the islands, and they were pushing that news to the poor, and they did not eat from it And they vilify those who did not enter it and call it the generosity.* * * The loyal question: they are different that the facilitator is a name for that appointed parts, or it is a name for all the types of bodies, narrated from the Prophet ﷺ: They are from the facilitator of the creek.May the peace be upon him that he said: Al -Narsa and Al -Shatnj are from the facilitator, and Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: If the Shattraj is removed from the bet, and the tongue is from the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from It is forbidden, and it is outside the facilitator; Because the facilitator is what is required to pay money, or take money, and this is not like that, it is not a gum or a facilitator, and God knows, but the predecessor is in the light and the ribbed, and the row is not.And his explanation is mentioned in the book of the precedent and throwing from the books of jurisprudence.* * * The fifth question: the great sin, in which there are things: one of them: that the mind of a person is the honor of his attributes, and the wine is the enemy of the mind, and everything that was the enemy The drink of wine is the lower of the things, and its report is that the mind is called a mind; Because he runs the course of the sake of the camel, then if a person calls him to his ritual act, his mind would have forbidden him from the feet on him, so if he is a good man The reaction of the doves is free from the mind, and the approach after that is known.As the rhetoric, and he says: Praise be to God who made Islam a light and water is purified, and on the authority of Abbas ibn Merdas that he was said to him in the ignorance of the ignorance: Increase your attempt?He said: I do not take my ignorance in my hand, so I will enter it, and I am not satisfied with the goodness of the master of people and my people Sorry.And the second: What God mentioned is the Almighty from the rhythm of enmity and hatred and the replacement of the remembrance of God and the prayer.And the third of it: that this disobedience is one of its properties that the human being is the more he dedicated to it more, and its perseverance is on it, the more millions of it were more and more powerful Mandaries, like the adulterer, if he did one time, then his desire to do so in that work, and whenever his action is for that work more, the more and more offended it, and the most of it is more and more.With the disagreement of drinking, it is the more it was for him more, the more his activity was more, and his desire for it is in it, so if the human being is upon him, the human being is in it.It is exposed to the remembrance of the hereafter and the restoration, until it becomes one of those who forgot God, so they forgot themselves, and in the sentence, the wine removes the mind, and if the mind is removed With her family, and for that, peace and blessings be upon him: “The wine is the mother of the hidden ones.” Money in falsehood and that also inherits the enmity; Because if his owner takes his money for free, he hates him very much, and he also turns away from the remembrance of God and from prayer The wine is that they (P-41) used to assassinate it if they crucified it from the aspects, and the cheerful, if he left the inauguration at the same time, would have prepared that of that, and a righteous, and a majestic The cause, and from it that it strengthens the weak, enters the food, is appointed to the pepper, the sorrows are shed Al -Ghuraiziyah and more in the dignity and the recovery, and from the benefits of the facilitator: the expansion of the need of the need; Because whoever is a moon did not eat from the islands, but he separated him in the needy, and Al -Waqidi mentioned that the one of them was a moon in the one who is the one who is a hundred Money is not hard and tired, then he drives him to the needy, so he is acquired from praise and praise.* * * The prevailing question: Reading Hamza and Al -Kisae (many) with the attributed to the pictured from above, and those who are stained with the stainedness of the time A lot of sin in wine and the facilitator, which is his saying: The Satan wants to sign between you, enmity and hatred in the wine and the facilitator [Al -Maaidah: 91] They are; Because the Prophet ﷺ cursed one tenth of wine, and that indicates the many inherent in them; Because the sin in this verse is like the anti -benefit; Because he said: They have a sin and a benefits, and as the benefits are many numbers, so that the sin became, so the estimation became as if he said: There are many harms, and a lot Many.The argument of the rest is that the exaggeration is in the greatestness It is forbidden for him [Al -Nasiya: 31], it was a great love [Al -Nasa: 2] and also the readers agreed on his saying: and their best is more than what is wrong, and that is the most desirable We said.* * * The righteous ruling on spending and asks you what they spend, say forgiveness, as well as God shows you the verses, so that you may think about the world And they ask you what they spend.Say the forgiveness, as well as God shows you the verses, so that you may think about the world and the hereafter (P-42).His remembrance, so I will answer him with the remembrance of the bank, and I will return here, so I will answer him with the remembrance of the quantum.And his creation: so so?He says: He is a man from his gold, and from his creation like this.If you know this, then he said: People were when they saw God and His Messenger embraced the spending and indicates the great reward Some of it, God knows them that pardon is an acceptance, and in the verse there are questions: the first question: the one said, may God have mercy [Al -Araf: 199] That is, the leadership, and he also said: Until their pardon [Al -Araf: 95], meaning they increased the number they had to The sufficiency, it is said: Take what is forgiven for you, that is, what is easy, and it is similar to that pardon is from the sin, referring to the hypocrisy and the sacrifice.The charity of the horses and the thickness, so they are a quarter of your money.Looking for demands, and he is returning to lightness, and it is said: He gave it as such as pardoning, if he is not able to harm him, and it is said: Take from the people, what is forgiven for you His Excellency said: Take forgiveness, that is, what is easy for you from people, and it is said to the easy land: pardon.And if the pardon is the facilitator, then the dominant is that that is what is preferred from the need for a person in himself and his dependents, and whoever is obligated by their supporters, then he said: Refer to the interpretation that we mentioned, and the sentence of the interpretation is that God Almighty has delegated people in spending, so he said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the peace be upon him.The path is not sowed, as the two sits were the brothers of the demons [Al -Asra: 26, 27] and he said: Do not make your hand a molder to your neck and do not be simplified: And those who They woke up, and they did not waste and did not take place [Al -Faraqan: 67] and he said ﷺ: “If one of you is something, let him start with himself, then he will say:“ And then he is the one who does not say.” And peace: He went and said: O Messenger of God, take it as a charity, and God does not possess it.Then he deleted it with it, where if he had been afflicted, he would have come to him, then he said: He will come to me, one of you with his mind, and he will not possess his other Take it, there is no need for us in it.Sorel, and the conversion is very stable, and justice is the guest and it is what is meant by his saying: Say pardon and the orbit of a Muhammad's law ﷺ on the pursuit of this porridge of this thorns The Jews are built on the roughness, and the Christians are based on the complete forgiveness, and Muhammad al -Muharid ﷺ is a mediator in all these things, so it was for all of these things.The second: Abu Amr (pardon) read the waw and the rest of the pods, so whoever raises it (the) in the sense of (the one who) and the success of his prayer, as if he said: He said: It is pardon, and whoever is in place is the estimation: they are spent?The voluntary, but those who say that it is (P-43) is the obligatory spending, so they say: The first: the saying of my father is a Muslim who may be pardoned, the zakat is the zakat, so it is the same.Al -Alasal, and its conquest is a male in the Sunnah.In their general, then the rest is spent, then this became a texture of the zakat verse, so this estimation is that the verse will be forgotten.The path of voluntary, which is charity, and this saying that if he was an exhibitor to show God, the Almighty is His Excellency, and when he did not show it, but he was rented to It is not an exhibition.God shows you the verses, so I mean that I have explained to you the matter, as you asked about him from the faces of spending and his expense, so I show you in the way of you.And he said: Perhaps you think about the world And the hereafter has faces in it: the first: Al -Hassan said: It is infection and the last, and the ability: as well as God shows you the verses in the world and the hereafter.The second: Likewise, God shows you the verses, so he will know that the wine and the facilitator are beneficial in the world and are harmed in the hereafter, so if you think in the last of the world It is necessary to prejudice the hereafter over the world.The third: It defines you that spending money in the faces of good for the last time and holding it for the sake of the world, so you think about the world of world Play the hereafter over the world.And know that when the words could be conducted on his appearance, as we decided in these two favors, then the assumption of adherence and delay - for what the good said - For a wire, and it is not permissible.
