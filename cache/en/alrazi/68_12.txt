The researcher is the Almighty: Do not obey the lies, know that it is up to the one who mentioned what the disbelievers have in the matter In the matter of religion and creation, follow him with what they invite to tighten with his people, and his heart is strengthened with that with the few numbers and the many infidels, so that this is the one who is the disbelief He said: Do not obey the liars, the heads of the family of Mecca mean that they called him to the religion of his fathers, so God will be obedient to them, and this is from God, and this is from God.They violate them.* * * Then he said: Wake up, if you are fat, then they will be painted, and do not obey all the beings of a humiliating, and they will be a gait with a good tidy.Two questions: The first question: Al -Laith said: The painful paint, the artists, and the approach in the words, said: It guarantees, and the meaning leaves some of what you are from what is not satisfied with it, so they will do like that and leave some of what you do not accept Atta narrated from Ibn Abbas: If they would atone, they will disbelieve.The second question: Rather, they were raised, and they are not applied, and it was not provided that it is the answer to the wish; Because he has amended to (P-74) another way, which is to make a beginner that is deleted, that is, they understand what they say as saying: Whoever believes in his Lord: Will, if you are fatting, then they would be fattened at that time.And know that it is up to the lying of the lies, and this is the prohibition on obedience to all the infidels, except that it has repeated the prohibition on the obedience of those who were from the disbelief A slave behind the infidels, and those attributes are this: the first characteristic: its sorrow is a sweet, and the walkers are the one who was the many sweets in the right and the falsehood, and it is sufficient for it, and it is sufficient for it, And the same is his saying: Do not make God a display of your faith (Al -Qarra: 224).The second line: as it is a humiliating, the gospel said: It is an acuity of the insult, then it contains it as it is: one of them: that the mockery is the few and the contempt in the opinion.The second: that it was insulting because the walker is the case in the lies, and the liar is despicable with people.And I say: It is a sweetness that indicates that he does not know the greatness of God Almighty and His Majesty, as if he knew that, he would not be given in all of the time and time for all the time He described him, and whoever was not a scholar of the greatness of God and was attached to the heart with the demand of the world was insult With the slaves, and that its whisper is only for those who have forgiven On the secret of the servants.The third righteousness: its universe is a stubbornness, which is the ritual of the stabbing.His thighs in the standing of people, and we have been excluded (the saying) in it in his saying: Woe to every angel (Al -Hamzah: 1).The righteous adjective: as it is walked with a bomber, that is, he walks with the name among the people to spoil between them, it is said: a sleep sleeps and sleeps and sleeps.The fifth adjective: it is an immunity for good and in which they say: One of them: that what is meant is a horse, and good money.The second: His family was prevented from good, which is Islam.This verse was descended in Al -Wahid ibn Al -Mughara, and he had ten of the children and he said to them and what they are close to them: If you follow the debt of Muhammad, no one of you, no one of you Islam, it is the good that prevented them, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he is a ignorant father, and on the authority of Mujahid: Al -Aswad ibn Abd Yaghtat, and on the authority of Al -Saddi: The Akhans ibn Shariq.Sixth adjective: his tenderness is aggressive, a fighter said: It is meaning that there is injustice that exceeds the truth and cripples it, so he brings the darkness and can be carried out by the whole.It means that it is an end in all the doves and the light.The sequence of the precedent: it is sinful, and it is exaggerated in the ingredient.The eighth adjective: the elderly and the words of those who are in it a lot, and it is counted in two things: one of them: that it is a defamation in creation.The second: that it is a defamation in the creation, and it is taken from your saying: He will be killed if he leads him with nose and rudeness, and he said to him: So they will be blessed (the smoke: 47).Creation, Ibn Abbas said in the narration of Ata: He wants: a huge strong.A fighter said: The extent of the stomach, the trust of creation, and Al -Hassan said: The obscenity is creation, the soul of the soul, and Ubaydah ibn Amir said: He is the one who is the evil.Al -Jafi.As for those who carried it (P-75) on the defamation of the ethical, they said: It is the hardship of the special, the foolish rude.The ninth line: its saying: a lanim in which there are two questions: the first question: in the adulterer, sayings: the first: Al -Faraa said: Al -Zanim is the supplication of the adhesion of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is affixed to the one who said: ؎ You are Zenim, which is in the family of Hashem, as the successor of the passenger is the one who is the righteous, the individual and the adultery of everything is the same, and the sheep is also increased if it is a hardship, then it will be made.And it remained like the suspended Shi, so it is the one that the adulterer is the son of adultery, which is attached to the people in the proportions and not from them, and the Walid was praying in the Quraysh, and there is no one from the Qur’an, Ten (night) from his birth.It was said: His mother was surprised and he was not known until this verse was revealed.And the second saying: The people said: The man is known to be evil and the mother as the sheep is known Its growth.And the third saying: On the authority of Akrama, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: The meaning of his color is a decoration that he had a laneh in his neck, and he said: The lane of the sheep.The second question: His saying (after that), it is that it was after him from the ideals and the purity, so it is a decay of Zanim, and this is the same.It is a decorative time.Because if it was dry, the print was tough, and he was cruel and dared to every disobedience; Because the majority is that the sperm, if the boy’s disappointment is hidden, and this is why he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: “He does not enter Paradise, the child of adultery, his son, nor his son.” A counterpart (then) in his saying: Then he was one of those who believed (the country: 17) and read the good (a long) raising the defamation.
