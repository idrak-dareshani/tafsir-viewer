The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: to God, the East and the Wester Know that in this verse there are questions: the first question: they disagreed about the descent of this verse.Whoever claims that it was descended in something that does not relate to the prayer, but the first saying is stronger for two juveniles: one of them: that he is the narrator of all the companions, and those who are the companions, And secondly: that the appearance of his saying: Where are they fully benefit the direction until the kiss in the prayer, and this is not reasonable from his saying: So they will come to you: This is proven, so we say: Those who say this saying, and they have disagreed with it.The Almighty (P-18) The East, the Wester, and the whole of the flaws and the signs, all of which are bored with his grace and his creatures, so that God bless you, and he is the one who is in the authority of God.Because the kiss is not a kiss for itself, but because God Almighty made it a kiss, then he made the heels before, so do not deny that; Because he is the highest manifestation of his worshipers, how he wants, and it is a wide knowledge of their reconciliation, as if it is the highest that he mentioned that in the way of the rituals of the kiss of the one who is a place That is presented as he wanted to translate the kiss.And the second: that when the kiss was transferred from the house of the sacred, the Judaism denied that, and the verse was revealed in response Al -Mushrq and Al -Maghrib guides those who create to a straight path [Al -Baqarah: 142].And the third of it: the saying of my father is a Muslim, which is that the Jews and the Christians each one of them said: Paradise has it, not for others.Because the Jews are accepted by the sanctuary of the sanctuary; Because they are in accordance with God, the Heavens of Heaven, from the rocks, and the Christians received the outskirts; Because Jesus, peace be upon him, was born there on what God told that in his words, the Almighty: and remember in the book Mary, as it was rejected by its people from the place of Mary: [16] These two parties and described his idols with solutions in the fish, and whoever is like this is a creature, not an empty, so how can he gave them paradise, and they are not separated.And its elevation: Some of them said: God Almighty has copied the house of the sanctuary by release to any side of this verse, so it would have been for the sake of the sake of the sake of the prayer, so that they would not be the prayer The Prophet ﷺ was the choice of the direction to the house of the sanctuary, with it that he had to go where he wanted, and then he was transcribed by that, and he is the one who said: Zoud.Fifth: that what is meant In the verse, who is a viewer of the cord, then he has to receive it on any one who wants and wanted.And its sixth: What was narrated by Abdullah ibn Amir ibn Rabiah said: “We were with the Messenger of God ﷺ in the invaders of the night of the darkness of a darkness, so we did not know From us, a mosque is a stagger between his hands, then our prayers, so when he became our morning, if we are on the other hand, then we remind us of that This is the verse, and this hadith indicates that they were transferred then to the Kaaba; And the sake of it: that the verse was descended in the traveler, the nawfil is praying, as it is directed with it.On the authority of Saeed bin Jabir, on the authority of Ibn Omar, he said: “This verse in the man came down to the man, so that he was directed to him.And peace be upon him, if he returned from Mecca, prayed to his place, a voluntary, he fled with his heads, as the city of the city.Your travels: So the face of God has lost the one who has been repeated, God is the same as the righteous rituals, so from the capacity of His grace and his rituals, he is all in that; Because if you have wrapped you, the kisses are like this case, and one of the two harm is necessary: ​​either the nawfil is left, or the descent from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The exhibits, as they are the equivalents of counted, so they can be given the descent from the travelers with its performance and the kiss in which it does not lead to the ritual, so it does not lead to the ritual It is not counted.If it was said: Which of these people is close to right?We said: His saying: So, when they take over, then the face of God is feelings of elimination, and the choice is only proven in two pictures: one of them: And secondly: in traveling when the domestication is excused for the darkness or otherwise; Because in these two favors, the worshiper is good, and otherwise, these two favors are not seduced.And the saying of those who say: God is the Almighty, the good of those who are in the interest of any side, they wanted this verse, and they were choosing the house of the sacred, not for the sake of it.And the first - by a long time; Because there is no disagreement that the sanctuary house before the manifestation of the Kaaba was disturbed in the project, and if the matter was as they said; This is not proven that the choice, and it was also necessary to say: The house of the sanctuary has become woven with the heel, so this sign is required that it is necessary that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who requires The third and the lifeline, but those who carried the verse on the first face, so they can say: The kiss is what was transmitted to the time of the prayer The holy house, so that the Almighty has shown that the verse is that The kiss was the ritual to it is right in that time, and the generosity to the Kaaba is right in this time, and he indicated that they are when they are taken from these two kisses in the two kisses The face of God, they said: And carry the words on this face.Because it is a prayer, and if he is carried on the first, he will not be done; Because it becomes a reservation on the voltage without abuse, and on the travel in a special case without attendance, and if he can conduct the general memorization of the general, then it is from the general, then it is from the general, then it is from the general, then it is from the general.And what is in the chapter is to be said: on this interpretation, it is also necessary to define the definition, which is to be said: then, when they are assumed from the mourning of the one who is the one who is the one who does not From it in every case; Because it is a referred to say the Almighty: So, when they are assumed according to the inclination of yourself, then the face of God, but it is necessary for the guarantee that we mentioned, and if it is so, then it is so.The choice, and his counterpart: if one of us accepts his son, and he has commanded him with many things On what he commanded on the direction that he commanded from the construction or seduction, and that is not carried on the absolute choice, so we are so.The second saying: It is the saying of those who claim that this verse was descended in something except the prayer It is mentioned in it my name and their struggle in its wages, those of them, such With them, their place is not hidden from me, and in that warning of tinkers and impartiality of their commitment, and the words of the Almighty: God is a wide knowledge of the one who said: The heat of the heavens and the earth, so you will be implemented only by the authority [Rahman: 33] So this is what is meant by the capacity of knowledge, and it is a counterpart: and it is with you, which is what you are: It will be from the Najwa of three, except that it is the one of them [Al -Mujadila: 7] and his saying: Our Lord has expanded everything with mercy and knowledge [Ghafir: 7] and his saying: With his knowledge, his mobilization, and his surrounding him and his highness on him.And the second: Qatada said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Your brother Al -Najashi has died, and they will be separated from him.The people of the book for those who believe in God, and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them, humbled to God, and they do not buy the verses of God, then a few of them are the best of them, for the Lord of God.Calculation [Al -Imran: 199] and they said: He was praying until the kissing, so God Almighty revealed: And God has the honor and the Moroccan The flaws that are prayed to the people of the boredom from the east and west of them - all of them - all of them, whoever directs and faces it is something of them with something that wants me, and he wants to see me, It was in this excuse for the Najashi and his companions who died on the outskirts of the honorable, and it is the one who said the Almighty: And God was not to be lost.[143] (P-20) And the third: When it came down, the Almighty said: Call me, I will respond to you [Ghafir: 60] They said: Where do we call him?So this verse was revealed, which is the saying of goodness, Mujahid and the laughter.And its booster: It is a discourse for the Muslims, that is, it does not prevent you from making you repent to those who have been raised by the mosques of God from his remembrance where you are from his land, and for the sake of God Ali bin Issa said.Fifth: It is among the people who claim that it has come down in the mujtahids who are fulfilled by the strains of the guidance, whether in prayer or otherwise, and what is meant is that the one who has seen it It is a calamity.The second question: If we are pleased with the verse that it indicates the permanence of the direction to any side that I want, then the verse is a texture, and if we are pleased with it, we will be pleased with it.Handing to the kaaba, then the verse is a dirt, and if we are pleased with the cararis of the faces, it is neither people nor bonds.The third question: the blame in his words is up to the Almighty: to God, the Mudharq and Al -Maghrib, the mother of the sealing, that is: it is their own and their owners, and it is like the saying of the Lord: [Al -Rahman: 17] And his saying: With the Lord of the Mashhar and the Maghrib [Al -Maarij: 40] Fight to the sky while it is smoke, so he said to it and the earth is a good or a hatred.* * * The following question: The verse is one of the strongest evidence of the negation of embodiment and the impulses of impurity, and his two sides: These two sides are full of it, but it was like that; Because the side is a matter of long, offensive, and deep, and everything that was like that is divided, and every division is a compounded component, and all of you was not, and for all of you, and for all of you, and for all of you And there, and this is a general significance in all of the flaws.Al -Bari, before the world’s creation, is based on the flaws and the bias.الوَجْهُ الثّانِي: أنَّهُ تَعالى قالَ: فَأيْنَما تُوَلُّوا فَثَمَّ وجْهُ اللَّهِ ولَوْ كانَ اللَّهُ تَعالى جِسْمًا, ولَهُ وجْهٌ جُسْمانِيٌّ لَكانَ وجْهُهُ مُخْتَصًّا بِجانِبٍ مُعَيَّنٍ وجِهَةٍ مُعَيَّنَةٍ, What was true of his saying: So when they are assumed, then the face of God, when God has stipulated, the Almighty is upon that, we know that he is the Almighty, which is removed from the generosity, and the abundance of the one who is the same The face of the face is proven to God Almighty, and the face is only for those who were a body.The second: It is upholstered and described its soul with a wide range, and the capacity is from the description of the bodies.The answer is about the first: that the face, even if it is in the origin of the language, is a phrase of the special member, but we have been shown that if we had carried it, we are on the one who said: Take off, then the face of God, because the face, even if it was adjacent to the East; It is impossible for that time to be adjacent to the Moroccan as well.In addition to creation and creation on the way of honor, then his saying: Then the face of God, that is,: then his face that directed you to him; Because the outskirts and the westernity have it, and the intended is from the kiss, but it is a kiss for its installation of the Almighty, so any face of the sake of the sake of the sake of the world, His erection and inspected it, and it is a kiss.The second: That what is meant is from the face of intention and the intention, the poet said: (P-21) ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The Almighty said: I directed my face to the one who breaks the heavens and the earth [Al -Anam: 79].The third: that what is meant by it is: then the pleasure of God, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: we are good for you to go to God [man: 9] means to God.Something is your face except its face [Al -Qasas: 88] Meaning: What was the pleasure of God, and the direction of the settlement is that whoever wants to go to a person is that he is still closer to his face One of the pleasures is that he is still close to his illness, for this is called the request of contentment with the request of his face.The lord: The face is a link as its saying: everything is cruel except its face and the people say: This is the face of the matter - they do not want something other than it It is not intended to be intended for this matter, and know that this interpretation is correct in the language, except that the words remain, for it is said to this saying: So what is the meaning of the saying of God: It is not permissible for him to be permissible, so he must be interpreted by the fact that what is meant is: then he kissed him, which he worshiped, or then his mercy and his mercy His illnesses.The answer is about the second: that he described his soul with his being, and he did not doubt that he could not carry him on his appearance, otherwise he is a divine, and he is divided, and he is a disgrace, and he is a divine, so he is a young man It must be carried at the capacity in the capacity and the king, or on the authority of the giving and mercy, or on the extent of the year In the way of reconciliation for the servants, they will reach his satisfaction, and perhaps this face with the words of the time, and it is not permissible to carry it on the sake of the knowledge, but the knowledge of the knowledge Repeat, as for his saying: knowledge in this position in the constraints; Let the prayer will be cautious about the deviation, from where it is conceived that he is the highest, he knows what is hidden and what is announced, and what is hidden from God, so that he will be warned, and he will be warm It is entitled to be the Almighty saying: a wide knowledge is that it is the extension of the ability to fulfill the reward for the reward for those who perform the prayer on its condition, and the death of it.The fifth question: If he kisses, and if he is arranged, it is one of the fading, and it is meaning that we are in.So when they were directed - the kiss.
