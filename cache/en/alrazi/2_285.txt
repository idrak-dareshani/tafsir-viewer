The researcher of the Quran, the Exalted: The Messenger believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord and the believers, every believe in God and his angels, his books, and his messenge We heard and obeyed your forgiveness, our Lord, and you are the fate in the verse.The king, the fullness of knowledge, and the glory of the power of God Almighty, and that is required as the talisms of the attributes of the division, followed by that by the fact that the believer is in the believer and the sake of the believer in God is exalted, and that is like the blame of the servants, and if he appears to us as the mammals of the division, and he appeared from us as the blame of the servants, then the one who is from Amim is a good and the best of it.The resurrection in our right is like the fullness of care, mercy, and goodness, God has fulfilled this hope.The second face in the systems: It is up to what he said: And if you look at what is in your own or hide it, God will hold you to you The bit, then it is the highest, the Aqeeb of that is what the reward of the praise of us and the praise of us, so he said: My servant says I am, and if I know all of you, I do not appear from your refinement, and I do not remember from it except what is praise for you and your blessings to you, until you know that I know that I know that And the ability, I am the whole in quality and mercy, and in the purification of good deeds, and in the seedlings on the calamities.The third face: He began in the Surah to praise the righteous who believe in the unseen, and they will make prayer and from what we have agreed upon, and they will spend, Praise them in the first surah, they are the nation of Muhammad ﷺ, and he said: The believers are every believe in God and his angels, his books, and his messengers, and we do not separate from one of his messengers By saying it in the first surah who believe in the unseen [Al -Baqarah: 3].Then he said here and said: We heard and obeyed us, and he is intended to say it at the beginning of the Surah and evaluate the prayer, and what we have gave them spent [Al -Baqarah: 3].Then he said: We are your forgiveness, our Lord, and you are the destiny, which is what is meant by his saying in the first surah and in the last they are sure [Al -Baqarah: 4] Then he told them to them, how are you?We say our Lord, do not take us if we forget or make us wrong [Al -Baqarah: 286] to the last of the surah, which is what is meant by saying it at the beginning of the surah, those are on the authority Al -Maalalh [Al -Baqarah: 5] So look at how to agree between the first and last of the surah.And the faster face: that the Messenger, if the king comes to him from God, and said to him: God has sent you a messenger to creation, so the Messenger is not possible With miracle God shows it a righteousness of that king in (p-112), he called it, and if not for that miracle, the messenger would be permitted to be that of the expert, and the one who is lost, Also, if he hears the words of God, he will be subjected to a miracle that indicates that the listener is the words of God, the Almighty, not otherwise, and this is the one who is an arrogant, the first: The words of God are not otherwise, so the king knows the mediation of that miracle that he heard the words of God Almighty.And the second: the rumor of the miracle by the Prophet ﷺ that that king is true in his claim, and that it is a king that God has sent, and not with Cancer.And the third of it: that the miracle takes on the hand of the Messenger at the nation until the nation inferred with it that the Messenger is true in his claim, so then for the sake A messenger from God, the nation is not able to know that, so when God mentioned the Almighty in this surah, the types of parts and the rulings of the rulings, he said: He said: The Messenger knows that this is a neighborhood from God, and he was described to him, and that he who told him with this king of a king who is subjugated by God, is the infallible, and for the sake The faith of the Messenger ﷺ mentioned that, which is the advanced arrogance, and his hindi mentioned the faith of the believers with that, which is the delayed arrangement, and he said: She contemplated the sects of the organizer of this surah and in the nature of its installation, knowing that the Qur’an is as it is miraculous with the according to the eloquence of its provision and the honor According to his formation and the purpose of his verses, and perhaps those who said: It is incapable of the calculation of his call The classes are not the one who is affiliated with these things, and the matter is not in this section as it was said: ؎ The Najam is the sins of the sight of his vision, and the sin is not for the sake And we ask God Almighty to benefit us from what we taught, and teach us what he benefits from him with his grace and mercy.* * * The second question: His Excellency said: The Qur’an and a sentence in which it is in the parties and rulings that have come from God Almighty, and that is not from the door of the meeting of the demons, nor from the types of magic, priesthood, and the people, That is with the appearance of the miracles that are brought up to the hand of Jabriel, peace be upon him.As for his saying: (And the believers), then they are informed: one of them: that the words are fulfilled when he said: (And the believers), then the meaning is: To him from his Lord, then he started after that by saying that every one who believes in God and the meaning: each one of the mentioned when it is presented, They are the Messenger and the believers who believe in God.The second indifference: that the words take place at his saying: What was revealed to him from his Lord, then he starts from his saying: and those who believe in the right He believed in all of his Lord, and the believers, they believe in God and his angels, his books and his messengers, so the first person is the one who is the one who is the first of the prayer A believer in his Lord, then he became a believer in him, and the numbers of faith began at the time of the recipient, and on the second point of view, he feels that he is the one who is the one who is the same It was revealed to him, as he said: You did not know what the book or faith [Al -Shura: 52] As for faith in God and his angels and his books and his messengers on the scourge, then he was from the one who had been.The first thing is, and how to follow that, with the peace of peace be upon him when he separated from his mother, he said: I am the servant of God, the book of the book, so if he did not come to the book, then he did not From God when it was a roll, how can it be said: Muhammad ﷺ was a disobedient with his Lord from the first thing that created the whole mind.(P-113) The third question: The verse indicated that the Messenger believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord and the believers who believed in God and his angels, and his Lord, The Messenger is with that, because the one who has been revealed to him from his Lord may be the words that are completely heard by others, knowing him, and he can believe in him, and he will not believe in him So, then he is ﷺ dispensed with faith in it, and it is not possible for others to believe in it.* * * Then God Almighty said: The believers are all safe with God and his angels, his books and his messengers, and in which there are questions: the first question: I know that this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has this These are the four times of faith.The first arrangement: it is the belief in God, the Glory be to Him, and that is because it was not proven that the world has a subjugation that is valid for all the estimates, a scholar of all the knowledge The needs, the knowledge of the Prophet, may not be known to them, peace and blessings be upon them, so the knowledge of God was the highest, so the prayer is, so God is the Almighty.And the second arrangement: that it is their pursuit and the exalted, but it is revealed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon them, by the mediation [Al -Nahl: 2] And he said: And the good news would not have spoken to him except a neighborhood or from behind a veil or a messenger sent a messenger, and he will be revealed by his permission what he does [Al -Shura: 51] And he said: The faithful spirit descended upon him on your heart [Al -Shuara: 193, 194] and he said: Shadid the powers of the powers [Al -Najm: 5], if it is proven that God Almighty lives, but he will reach the humanity with the mediation The cause made the remembrance of the angels in the second arrangement, and for this secret he also said: God witnessed that there is no god but He and the angels and the first of knowledge is based on Qassam: The third aspect: the books, which is the revelation that the king is attached to God Almighty and connects it to the human beings, and that is in the attempt of the example running the course The sun is the same as the king, like the moon and the same revelation, as the moon of the moon.It is expressed in this book, for this reason, the books were delayed in the arrangement of the angels, so there is no crime, God is the Almighty.And the righteous arrangement: the messengers, and they are those who say that the lights of the revelation are from the angels, so they will be delayed in the custody of the books, so let the books be made.Remember the messengers in the louder, and know that in the formation of these four times on this direction, a great ruling, and a great wisdom that is not good in the kinetic and the best Which we mentioned is sufficient to supervise.* * * The second question: what is meant by faith in God is a phrase of faith in its existence, affiliations, acts of acts, rulings, and gravity.As for faith in its existence, it is that he knows that behind the biases are an empty, and on this estimated, the embodiment is not a determination to be ahead of the ritual Beyond the biases of something else, it will be his disagreement with us in the same proof (P-114) God is the Almighty.Included for it, so the dispute is with them, not in the self, but rather in the attributes.As for faith in his affiliations, the characteristics are either negative, or identification.As for the robe: it is that he knows that it is a devoted individual from all the prestiges Other than him, it is a rich, for it is a lack of it, and it is possible for it to be the same, for every crop is possible, so it is possible for itself, and everything is not possible for it, and it is not possible for it to be.To be a ride in the face of the faces, but it was an absolute individual, and if it is an individual in itself, it is necessary that it would not be a bias, no body, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case, nor in the case A place, nor disbelieving, nor needed by the face of the bitter faces.As for the confidential adjectives: He knows that the obligatory person has attributed it to some of the possibilities as its attribution to the seeds, so when our opinion is That these creatures have fallen into a face that can be fell on the dispute of those conditions.Of the rulings and perceptions of his knowledge, then he knows him, a vast, hearing world, with a visionary, described in the majesty, and the attributes of the Kamal, The interpretation of his saying: God has no god but He is the living living [Al -Baqarah: 255].As for faith in its acts, then you know that all of what it is, it is possible to have occurred, and you know the beginning of your mind that the one who is updated is not the same He finds it, which is the old, and this indication is that you can defeat that all that it has, but it is obtained by creating it, finding it and forming it, but it is the one who is in it Which is the optional verbs of the tales, for the first judgment is that it is an updated possible, so it is imperative to be attributed to the obligation of the existence that is mentioned in it.If you say: I am finding myself that if I wanted to move, I will move, and if I wanted, I would not move, I would not move, so my movements and my reside are not.So we say: You have suspended your movement with your will to move you, and I will be your will to your will, so you will be your will, so that you will not be the will of the waters of the war.The will of the tranquility does not dwell, and when the will of the movement of the movement must be moved.If this is proven, then it is said: This is the will, how to happen, then it is its junction, either that it is not with the modern modern or it is an upright, then it is a modern, then that is the one who is the one who is a modern, then that The servant, or God is upset, then if you spoke, not with an event, then the denial of the chain of transmission is required, and if it is the worshiper, the servant is a lack of its events, and it is not a matter She proven that her speaker is God, Glory be to Him.If this is proven, then he says: There is no choice for a person in the resurrection of that will, and after her juice, then there is no choice for him in the arrangement of the verb with him, and no To do after the will, the human being is obliged in a fascinating form, for this is a strong and strong words, and in his status, I am a cocoon: how to find a good This is the doves and the bells of disbelief and immorality?And the second: If everyone was creating it, then how the matter is directed and forbidden, praise and vilification, (p-115) and the reward and punishment on the servant?This is the letter that is dependent on it from the side of the characteristic, except that it is also responded to it in knowledge of what we decided in the positions of several.As for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is loyal to the faith in God: it is the knowledge of its rulings, and it is necessary to know in its rulings the four things that one of them is: it is not the same, because it is not a matter Delivered by a cause that his owner was deficient in the whole, completely with him, and that is on the right to be referred He knows that the intended one of its law is a good that is based on the servant, not to the right, for it is a balance from the ribs of the benefits and the payment of the harms, and the third is that it is: The world is how he wanted and wanted.And he pushed it: He knows that it is not obligatory for anyone the right to the reason for his work and his acts of things, and that they will be given it in the hereafter, he forgives those who are forgiven, and he will be forgiven.With his justice, and that nothing is ugly from him, and nothing is obligatory for him, because everyone is his kingdom and his king The real money.As for the fifth arrangement in faith in God: the knowledge of his names said in the norms, and God has the good names [Al -A'raf: 180] and he said in the children of the brooms, whatever what you call, then the name is: God has no god but He who has the good names [Taha: 8] and he said in the last of the good news to Him, the good heavens.The descendant of the Sunnah of its informative, and this indication of the holding of faith in God.As for the faith in the angels, it is from four aspects: the first: faith in its existence, and the search for it is a spiritual spirituality, or a body, or a makar And in the estimation of its body, it is a pleasant or thick bodies, then if it is funny, then it is the noodles, or a air, and if it is like that, then it is like that It will be with the roll of its bodies with the language in the power to the extreme end, and that is the shrine of the well -established scholars in the science of the Qur’anic rule and the proof.And the second arrangement in faith in the angels: the knowledge that they are informed, purified, fear their Lord from their understanding and do what they command [Al -Nahl: 50] And they do not be fascinated by [the prophets: 19], because you have the remembrance of God, and he forgot them with the worship of God, and that every one of us is the same as the same one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Their life is the remembrance of God and his knowledge and his obedience.And the third aspect: that they are a mediator between God and among the human beings, for every section of them is rejected by a section of the sections of this world, as he said: [Al -Saffat: 1, 2], and he said: The aversion is an offspring.2] And we have mentioned the interpretation of these verses as hidden secrets, if the rituals are seen in the science and stopped them.And the righteous arrangement: that the books of God, but it came to the prophets by the medium of the angels, God Almighty said: He said the Messenger of a generous messenger with a powerful.A obedient place Then a mother [Al -Takwir: 19, 20, 21] This is the one who must be in the validity of faith in the angels.“ Magician, nor from the chapter on the meeting of those who are bounds and the signs, and the second: that he knows that the revelation of this books, even if it is before the angels of the purified, for the purpose of the purified, for the purpose Throughouts from the meeting of something from their delusion in this purchase of this purified neighborhood, and when this is known that whoever said: The Satan is the one who says: Those of the Gran He said a great saying, and the stabbing and accusation of the Qur’an.And the third aspect: that this Qur’an was not changed and was not distorted, and he entered into it, the corruption of the saying of those who said: If the Qur’an is on the authority of this face, then he is the one who is the one who does not.About him, for those who said that the Qur’an was brought out from his argument.And the righteous arrangement: that he knows that the Qur'an is a disgrace to the arbitrator and the similar, and that his court reveals his simplicity.As for faith in the messengers: there must be four things in it: the first arrangement: that they know that they are infallible from sins, and we have judged this His saying: So the Satan is removed from it, so they will be brought out from what they were in [Al -Baqarah: 36] and all the verses that the disagreement holds is that we have mentioned the face of this With the help of God, the Glory be to Him.And the second arrangement: one of the paths of faith in them is that he knows that the Prophet is better than one who is not a prophet, and from Sufism who is disputed in this door.The third is: some of them said: They are better than the angels, and many of the scholars said: The heavenly angels are better than them, and they are better than the angels, and the angels are the same This question is in the interpretation of his saying: And when we said to the angels, they found for the Adam [Al -Baqarah: 34] and for the cores of the disclosures in this question.The righteous arrangement: that he knows that some of them are better than one, and we have explained that in the interpretation of his saying, the Almighty: that is the messenger, and he is the best of them.He denied that and touched his saying, “Him in this verse, and we do not separate between one of his messengers.And the scholars answered that the intended one of these words is something else, which is that the way to prove the prophecy of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon them, if they are present, is the one who is present, and the one who is present is the one who is present.They called them, so if this is the way, it is necessary in the right of everyone who appeared the miracle on the one who claims his claim to be sincere, and if this method is not correct It does not indicate the right of one of them to the validity of his messenger, but it is indicated by the message of some without some, a ponding, contradictory, and the abuse of it, Those who acknowledge the Prophet Moses and Jesus, and they lie to the praise of Muhammad ﷺ, so this is what is meant by the words of the Almighty: We do not separate from one of the people of no It is permissible for some to be better than one than one, so this is the sign to the origins of faith in God and His angels, his books and messengers.* * * The third question: Read the Hamza (and his book) on one, and the rest (his books) is at all, while the first is in his face and Jahan: (p-117) one of them: Faith in it and guaranteeing faith in all books and messengers, and the second: in the sense of genius, and he agrees with the meaning of collection, and his counterpart is the saying of God: And those who were cautious and descended with them the book with the right [Al -Baqarah: 213].If it is said: the name of the gans is the general one if it is counted by the thousand and the blame, and this is an addition.We said: The added of the names came and means the many.[Al -Baqarah: 187] This replacement is great in all fasting, the scholars said: The readers with gathering are more preferred by the problems that he accepted and what is after the memorization The readers gathered in his saying: (and his messengers) at the annexation of the Sunnah, and on the authority of Abu Amr, its knocks, and on the authority of Nafaa (and his books and his messengers) are diluted, and the rituals of the ritual On the verb of the eyes of the eye, and the argument of Abu Amr is that the fourth of the lighter does not take place; Because they have disliked that, and for this, these movements are not in a poetry, except that it is a museum, and the first answered that it is his deceitful in the word one in the word.The slurring is not necessary in (and made) that with the rolling in it in it five moving, and the word, if it is connected to it, is a two -word, not a single word.The following question: His saying: We do not separate between one of his messengers in which he is deleted, and the estimation: They say we do not separate between one of his messengers and his messenger Basso, their hands are brought out.The fifth question: Abu Amr (separated) reads that the verb is for each, and the servant of God (they do not separate).The sixth question: “One” in the sense of gathering, as his saying, as one of you is a needy one [Al -Haqaqa: 47] and the estimation: We do not separate from all of him, this is the one who said, And when it is not permissible to be one of us in the sense of gathering; Because it is The estimation becomes: We do not differentiate between all his messengers, and this does not contradict their being separated between some of the messengers and what is meant by the negation is this; Because the Jews and the Christians were not separated from all the messengers, but between the bit of one while he was praise ﷺ, and it has proven that the interpretation that he mentioned is false, but the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, but the meaning of the meaning, but the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of One of the messengers, and among others in the prophecy, then if we interpret it with this, the intended thing about the words, and God knows.* * * ثُمَّ قالَ اللَّهُ تَعالى: وقالُوا سَمِعْنا وأطَعْنا غُفْرانَكَ رَبَّنا وإلَيْكَ المَصِيرُ.In the verse: the first question: the words in the system of this verse from the faces: the first: that is, as the human being, to know the truth for itself, and the best of the time The theoretical power of science, and the continuation of the operational power with the act of goodness, and the theory force is honored by the power of the operation, and the Qur’an is from the mill The theoretical power will be presented on the process.He said about Ibrahim, the Lord And he joined me with the righteous, such as the options of the operational power, and we have given us this meaning of the Qur’an when it is presented from this book.(P-118) If you know this, then say: The matter is in this verse, too His messengers are a sign of the continuation of the theoretical power with this honest acquaintance, and he said it and said: We heard and obeyed a sign of the continuation of the power of the power The full virtuous works, and whoever stands on this joke knowing that the Qur’an has been disobeyed on wondrous secrets that he has overlooked.And the second face: from the systems in this verse that a person has three days: the touch and the search for it is called the knowledge of the principle, and the day is the present and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The mediator, tomorrow and searching for it is called the knowledge of the re -.And the Qur’an is a disgrace to the patronage of these three times.The principle, and when the facts were only knowledge and destiny, there is no crime of its remembrance in this verse, and his saying, and God has the absence of the heavens and the earth, and the earth is the same And for it all the matter returns a sign of the amount of power, for this is the sign for the science of principle, and the knowledge of the medium is the knowledge of what is required of it to do so, so that it is that it does not.The beginning and the end, but the beginning is the preoccupation with the slave, and the end is cut off from the causes, and the elaboration of all things to the caused by the causes of the causes By taming, so he mentioned these two The two shrines, so he said: He worshiped him and relies on him [Hood: 123].As for the knowledge of the hostility, it is his saying: What is your Lord with the heavie of what they do [Al -Anam: 132], that is, your day tomorrow, in which we will reach your business to you, so that you will be blessed with you What he is searching for in these three times, and its counterparts is also his saying of his chains and the Almighty: Glory be to your Lord, Lord of Pride, with what they describe [Al -Saffat: 180] Then he said: Peace be upon the messengers [Al -Saffat: 181] and it is a sign of the knowledge of the medium, then he said: And praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Saffat: 182] and it is a sign of the knowledge of the re -he said in the knowledge of what he said.He called them in them, may God bless you and give them peace in it [Yunus: 100].If you know this, then we say: The definition of these three times is mentioned in the last surah of the cow, so he said: The Messenger believed to the saying of his saying: His messengers are a sign of the beginning of the beginning, and he said it and said: We heard and obeyed a sign of the science of the middle, and it is the knowledge of the conditions that must be a scholar of it.In this worldly life, our Lord, our Lord, and your destiny, will be a sign of the knowledge of the re -of the re -know The bodies are to wipe the orbits of the orbits, and the lights of the skies of the heavens.The third direction in the systems: that the demands are the sects of one of them: searching for the facts The second: searching for the rulings of verbs in the obligatory, permissible and barrier.As for the first section, it is beneficial from the mind, and the second is beneficial from the hearing, and the first section is what is meant by its saying and the believers, the one who is safe and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who believes And they said, he heard and obeyed us.The second question: The one said, may God have mercy on him, his saying: He heard and obeyed us, that is, he heard his saying and obeyed his command, except that he deleted the verb, because the verb is the one who is the verb.Where they are praised.And I say: This is from the door that Abd al -Qahir al -Nahwi mentioned it, may God have mercy on him, that the act of the one is in which it is apparently His saying, and we obey him, so if we say another saying otherwise, he said, and another matter is obeyed (P-119), so if he is not able to do so, then he will be in it.Woods are a saying that it must be heard except his saying, and there is no matter in the existence that is said in his interview that we obeyed only his command, so the act of the verb was a picture of this.The third question: Know that it is exalted when he described the faith of these believers and described them after that by saying: He heard us and obeyed us, so he said: From it the phenomenon; Because that does not benefit the praise, but what is meant is that we heard it with the ears of our minds, that is, we are our mind and our knowledge is authentic On the tongue of the angels and the prophets, peace and blessings be upon them, it is a right right and a duty of acceptance, and hearing in the sense of acceptance and understanding is in the Qur’an: For those who had a heart or a hearing and a martyr [Q: 37] and the meaning: for those who heard the remembrance with a present understanding, and the reflection of it is the saying of it: as if he is not heard as if he is not.[Luqman: 7] Then he said after that (and obeyed us), so this indicated that it was as it was correct in this talism It relates to the doors of the mandate with knowledge and action.* * * Then he told them after that, that they said your forgiveness, our Lord, and you are the destiny in which there are questions: What is the need for them to seek forgiveness?The answer is from the faces: the first: that they made their efforts in the performance of this destination, except that they were disobedient of shortening, and they will be disobedient, so when they have come to you, they said that they said that It is meaning that they seek the forgiveness before it, while they are afraid of their shortcomings while they come and be attempted.And the second: It was narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “He will not be overwhelmed by my heart, and I will seek forgiveness from God in the day and night seventy times.Its summary: that he, peace and blessings be upon him, was in the promotion in the grades of the servants, so the more he was promoted from a place to a place higher than the first.So the request of forgiveness in the Qur’an is carried in this verse on this direction, too.The third: that all obedience is in the interview of the rights of his crimes, and all kinds of knowledge that occurred at the creation in the interview of the lights of its arrogance, the shortness of it Therefore, he said: And they did not appreciate God, the right of His destiny [Al -Anam: 91] and if it is like that, then the servant is in any place that was from the place of the servants, and if it is a very scholar, if it is a slave of that I see the shortcomings that must be forgiven from it, and this is the secret in his saying of the Almighty to Muhammad ﷺ: I know that there is no god but God and seek forgiveness from God: 19] His servants, even if it is high, but he was revealing to him in the grades of his disclosures that it is on the basis of what is appropriate for the urbanization of the custody of the one, so that it is from the shortness of it.Likewise, he told the people of Paradise as their words, and he said, “He called them, may God bless you and greet them in peace [Yunus: 10] So they gave you a referral to the time.Then he said: He called them in it, God bless you, and give them peace in it [Yunus: 10] means that all praise be to God, and if we do not appreciate it, then it is upon you In our tongue.The second question: its saying: (your forgiveness) is its estimation: the forgiveness of your forgiveness, and the export is used to the verb in the supplication, we said (P-120).Farah: It is the source of the fall of the matter, and it is established, and the same is the prayer of prayer, and the lion of the lion, and this is the first of the saying of those who said: We ask you for your forgiveness; Because this formula is when it was a subject of this meaning, it was evidenced by it, and its counterparts said: Hamad, praise, and thank you, Thanks.The third question: that the request of this forgiveness is a couple with two things, one of them: with the addition to it, and it is his saying: (your forgiveness) and the second: Foods are included: no one: you are the whole in this row, for you are the forgiveness of sins, and you are forgiven and your Lord, the Forgiving [Cave: 58] and it is the Forgiving: Take forgiveness from your Lord that he was a forgiveness [Noah: 10] means that his forgiveness was not from this time, but rather before this time, the forgiveness of the sins, so the forgiveness of the sins Like the craft for him, then he said it (your forgiveness) means asking for forgiveness from you and you are the fullness of this adjective, and the one who is all in the fullness of the fullness is that it is given, So his saying: (your forgiveness) is a request for a complete forgiveness, and that is only that all sins forgive his preference and mercy, and replace it with the goodness, and he will replace it with the goodness, and he will replace it with the goodness of it God will be good.[Al -Furqan: 70].And the second:
