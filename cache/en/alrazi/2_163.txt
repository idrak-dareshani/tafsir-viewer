The Quranic researcher (P-153) said by his God, and God is no God, and there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.The Most Merciful [Al -Fatihah: 1] One of them: to be a name, and the other is to be a description, for the name that is not in a description of their saying: one who is used in the number is one of the two: one of the two, so one of the three, so one of the three, so one of the three, so one of the two, so one of the two, one of the two, so one of the two, one of the two: Just as the enemy of the numbers of the number like that, and as for it as a row, then they said: I passed by one man, and this is one thing, so if this is done, this is the right of this It is permissible for him to be the description like the scientist and the one, and it is permissible for him to be the name as our saying is something The words in the mind that the things that are believed are that they are one of the partnerships in the concepts Supporting, body, or inventory, and is also valid for every one of them, meaning what is his essence and one with one with the time of the other, so then, then the time An example is not, and its universe is one, and the compound from them is not, so the one is a tired one that benefits the inventory of the meaning that it is one, and this is the name, and it is the name, and it is the name, He gets an obedience to something else, and this is the meaning of its obedience.The second question: The one is an increase in the self or not?They differed in it, and a people said: It is an increase in the self, and they needed it that if we said; This is one of the concepts, so the concept is one of its voices, other than the concept of one of its universe, with the same way that the jewel is shared by the offer in the cousin, and no He is a jaws, and because it is correct to realize his universe, the state of the sacrifice is one of his being, one of which is one, and the learned is a man who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the knowledge One of the same as a jewelry, for our saying is one of the righteous, the course of our saying: The height is a jaw, and because the corner of the jewel is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The many, so it was proven that the concept is one of its universe, either to be negative or proven, and it is not permissible to be negative; Because if it was negative, it was a negative for the many, and the many are either to be robust or identical, then if it is a richest, and the righteousness, and the righteousness, The unit was a negative of the negative and the robe of the robe is confirmation, so the unit is identification and it is the one who is required, and if you are a lot of confirmation and there is no one for many, there is no way The units, and if the unit was a negative with the many, the group was a matter of supplied, and it was referred to, so it was proven that the one is a zipper, an increase Evidence, then this intense adjective is either said that it is not achieved for it except in the mind, or if it is fulfilled by the elderly, and the first is false Performed by what is in the outside, so it is necessary for a single thing not to be one of itself, and it is referred to that we know the harm that the thing is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was It is before it was found, and it is angry, and it was made.The unit is a confidential description that he said: If the unit was an excessive adjective on the self, the units were equal in what is the same as the same and the same and the one who is one, and the one is so With its inspection, it is necessary to be for the only one one, and it will be successful to what is not endowed for it while it is referred.(P-154) The third question: The one is the thing that is not divided from the side of what was said to him that he is one, for the one is the one who is alienated to be divided by a person who is divided by a person who is a person who is divided by a person It is divided into the hearts and the parts of the supplies, it is not removed from the one until the number is the same one where it is one tenth, so it is the same.You said: Twenty, the two twenty times, one of which has been exposed to this side, for nothing Some of them are the same, so he thought that all the supplies of what was believed to him is that one of his existence was the same as the same, and the truth is that it is like it.Because the existence is divided into one and the many, and the division is divided into something that is due to what it has.The following question: The right is its two, and one is a single adult.One of them: that it is not a compound from the meeting of many things.The second: that it is not in the existence that he shares in his being, and the obligation is required and in his being a principle of the stomach of all the places, so the abundance of the individual is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the age With the first interpretation, and not one of the second interpretation.And the proof of the confirmation of the unit by the first interpretation that if it was compounded, it would be determined to achieve it to the achievement of every one of its parts, and each of its parts, and each of its part So every cruise, it is a lack of it, and all the lack of it is possible for its own and it is obligatory for others, so it is a compulsion, so it is not possible, so it is not possible, so it is not.It is also an impermissible to be a compound, so then his truth is a jurisprudence of one individual individual, not a lot in which there is a lot of whatever Approach, as it is for the bodies, nor a lot of intense, as it will be for the n among the rich in the chapter, the gender, or the person who is the one who is the one who is the one However, he has made it difficult for the people, and that is because it was a graceful scholar.A good neighborhood, for the concept of these attributes is either the soul of the concept of itself, or it is not like that and the first is invalid for its face: one of them: that it is that it is possible Thursday from every one of this characteristic, and if this is not possible, then it is not doubted that it is possible for us to mind each one of these attributes with the same.The special is, but this is the duty of the one who says: The special self is unknown, and his attributes are known and the information is not a matter of what is not, so it is not for what is not.Descriptions are increased on the self.And the second: that these attributes, even if they were the same self, were our saying in the self: it is a world or is not a world of course, our saying: the self is a self or a soul That is in the search, it is necessary for the proof to be held on its negation and its evidence, for whoever says: the self is the same as one of the harmful ones, and whoever says: One of the harm is his lies, and when our saying: the self is a world or is not a world that is not a reward for our saying: the same self is not the same.Increased on the self.And the third of it: that if the reference was for this characteristic of itself, then it was only one thing, and it was only one thing.The resurrection of the indication will be in its place, as it will be sought from the establishment of the significance on his being a scholar, and on his neighborhood, and when he was not in all of you, but it is not so A special indication, we know that it is not returned to the self, if it is proven that these attributes are increased matters on the self, so we say: This is the characteristics of the rituals, or the rituals are that Confidentiality, it is not permissible to be negative; Because the negative is a pure negation, and the pure negation is not devoted to it, and because we made it as a scholar who is able to express the exile of the ignorance and the absence, and the absence, and the reward, for the sacrifice The reference will be with them to the numbers and that it is not a world and is unable, or the reference is to a proven matter: that ignorance is a burden on the absence The state of ability, if the first was knowledge and ability to express the negativeness The knowledge and power achieves, for the beauty has passed away from ignorance and the reward for this meaning with the fact that it is not described by the knowledge and the ability, and the righteousness is that An excess of himself is a valid one, and God is a reflection of the group of self and adjectives, so the saying has returned until the truth of God is a compound, from a lot of things In it?And other forms: It is that we have indicated that the unit is an increased adjective on the self.The truth of the truth is one, so there are three things: that fact, and that one, and the mystics of that truth with that one, then three, then three Judaism?And a third forms: that that is the truth, is it a supply and a duty of existence or not?If it is a supply, it is its existence, it will be destroyed by the bridges of the stations, and with its meanings, it is characterized by the man of the muds, so there is a large number of people, and there is a lot of people, and there is a lot.It was not a rejuvenation, as this is a sign of the numbers, as well as saying in the obligatory; If it is the duty of the existence for itself, then it is the duty of its existence, then it is impossible to be the eye of the self; Because the garment is a description for the affiliation of the subject to the presenter with the mystical, and the affiliation is a stimulant between the two things, the meaning of each of them is one of them.The adjective of that affiliation is a majestic for them, and also, as the same is based on itself, and it is impossible to be the name of the duty, and it is a matter of the soul, and that we are the same as the soul With the journey, and describing the thing with itself, it was reflected, so it was proven that if it was obligatory, and it was obligatory, and it was obligatory, and it was obligatory, and it is excessive, and it is a good person.That is the same with that beard and with the Sufis with that dress, so the triangle has returned.And a luxurious forms: which is that this is the righteous fact, can the news can, and can it be expressed or not?The first is referred; Because the news is only about anything, then the informative is not the one who is informed of it, they are two things, not one, and if the abuse is not for him, then it is not the reason for it With the evidence, it is forgiven for it, for this is the sentence of what is in this place of the questions: The answer is about the first: that it is a bitter one with the sake of the righteousness, and there is no doubt, and there is no way.In his investigation to achieve his parts, the self is based on itself a duty of itself, then it is after its merit with the enemy of the ritual And the adjectives, this is what is not forbidden in the mind.As for the second forms: that the unit is an increase on the self, then if you look at it from where it is one, then there are three things, not one thing, then the answer is that the answer is that But he was divided between the views of it from where he is and between the views of it from where he is a rule over him that he is one of it One, there is the fulfillment of the one, and we are a wondrous condition, for the mind is as long as it is intended to the one, so it is not after it to reach the world He came to the same, so consider this situation with your pleasant pleasure, so that you may reach his secret, and this is also the answer to the forms of existence and the forms of juice.As for the luxury forms: It is that it is possible to express About him?The truth is that it is not possible to express it; Because when you crossed it, you have told him about another matter, and the informant about it is a metaphor for the one who is informed of it, there is no referral, so there is no one, and there is no one, and there is no one, and there is no (P-156) The news can be from it, so there is a special depression with a special depression, so there is no jurisprudence there, but if you look at it from where it is from it, it is not from it.With the evidence, there is the right to the principles of the world, and then the reminders are not possible to express it except by saying it: This word is with those who are in the sailor of al -Tawhid, and we will remember a tattoo of its entitlements in the interpretation of this verse with the help of God There is nothing in the existence that he shares in the duty of existence, because this unit is the special unit in the same right of the right and the exalted His Excellency said: If there were gods except God, they would spoil [the Prophet: 22] As for the one with the first interpretation, it is not among the properties of the same right; Because there is no doubt about the extent of the existence of the existence, and this is the supplies of either individuals or compounds, so the compound must be in which the individualism is necessary, so it is proven that it is not possible that it is not possible that it is not possible The possibilities, for the first meaning of the first meaning is not among the things that unite the truth, they will be with it, but the one is the second meaning, the truth is the right of it, and the right is the right of it.With it, and it does not share it in that grace anything but it is, for this is the deduction of the words in this place according to what is appropriate for the mind of the human being and its mind, with the heart of the It is a feature of the notes of ideas and arrows, and the minds of the minds and understandings.* * * Fifth question; Al -Jubai said: God describes the Almighty that he is one of the four faces: because he is not with the opponents, nor with the parts of the parts, and because it is alienated, and it is the one who is alienation, Because it is alienated with the same characteristics of itself, we are as a scholar of itself, and it is valued by itself, and Abu Hashem is emitting on three of his three With the present and the descriptions of the same faces, the judge said: And in this verse that is intended to be separated by the distraction only; Because he added the neutrality to that, and that is his punishment for his saying, there is no god but He.And our companions said: He is a one who is one in his soul, and he has no crop for him, and he is tight in his attributes, and he has no youth, and he is a one in his actions, and I have no partner for him, but he is one of him The special is the one who is referred to by our saying: It is the right to be glorified and exalted, either that you will have a person in another person, or do not be, then if the first is the first On the other meaning, it is necessary to be an increase Publishing with what is the consent and what is with the boss, so it is possible with a heartfeller and that is referred to, and if it is not, it is not the same as it is that it is not the same.He has it, but he is one in his attributes, because his mysticism is a distinctive characteristic of his mystics, other than him, with the adjectives of what he has: Because the arrival of his attributes to him does not be of himself, but rather from him, and he is his pursuit of his attributes to himself for himself, not for others.And the second: that the characteristics of others are specialized with time without time; Because it is an upright, and the attributes of the right are not like that.And the third of it: that the characteristics of the truth are not aware of the attachment, because its knowledge is attached to all the information and its ability is attached to the whole, but it is a matter Among the infinite information is unknown, unknown.Because he knew in that emerging individual that it was how it was, and it is the case in the sense of each one of the ethnic bias, and according to each one of the rituals One in his attributes from this side.And the one who has been seen: that it is not the same as the same characteristics of those attributes in the sense of their being in itself in itself, and the same is a place for it, and it is not the same, as well Complete it; Because we have indicated that the self is the beginning of those attributes, and if the same was completed by the adjectives, the beginning would be deficient for the same one, and it is in full The same is a consequence of itself, and from that of that is the one who is the opposite of the attributes of the whole, except that the division is returning to the soul of the The light is shortened by it.(P-157) Fifth: that there is no news with the minds of his attributes, as he has not been told about it from his own; That is because we do not know from his knowledge except that the matter for which the appearance of rulings and perfection appears in the world of the creatures, so what is known is that it is something that is not, and it is not what is, and it is not a matter of what he is, and there is no matter From him that he is obligated by this misfortune, and so is the saying in his being, and a living and alive.One in his actions, the matter is back; Because the supply is either obligatory, or it is possible, it is the duty it is, and it is possible that it is promised, and everything that was possible is that it is permissible that it is not found that it is not connected to the duty, and this is not the authority, and this is not a duty, and this is not a duty, nor is this.The possibilities, whether it was a king, a king, or a verb of worshipers, or if it was not, so you have proven that all that he promised is his king and his king and his king and his king And his estimation and his loyalty, and when this is a tattoo of the openings of the secrets of his judiciary and his destiny, and something for you is a thing of his saying: I am all of his saying: [Moon: 49] And it is known that the fence is not The bit is only what it is, and what it is for it, and if the idea of ​​the idea is located in this journey, then if it went to the forefront, it would not stand; Because the traffic is from something to something, the first thing is a murder, and the second thing is required, and they are surprised, and you are after the outside of the world And al -Wahdiyyah, but if you reach the stroke of the world of polish and the feet, then there are the movement of the movements, and the signs of the signs and the emirates are broken, and it is not left in the minds and the minds, And whoever is not only is the best to your weak servant; If your servant is your veneration and your calamity with your door.* * * The sixth question: If it is said: What is the meaning of its addition with its saying: And your God is, and you will correct this addition in all creation or do not correct except in the one?We said: When the god was worthy of being a servant and who is upset with him to be the servants of this description, but it is fulfilled by the one who will be fulfilled to the one who is more God is exalted, for this addition is correct with the lineage to all costs, and to all those whose goodness is corrected as a cost.The seven question: His saying: And your God is indicated that the meaning of God is what is correct for the addition to enter it, and if the meaning of God is the one who will be the meaning of the meaning, and the meaning of the meaning, and the meaning of the meaning, It is a pillar, and it indicates that God is the servant.The eighth question: His saying: And your God is one of the Gods, meaning that he is one of the divine; Because the one was given to the one who has been given after the disclosure of God, it indicates that that unit is considered an adept in divine, not otherwise, so it is in a hole and a man, and the man is the same One scholar, and when he said: And your God is one of the gods that could be taken to one of the Bep of one to say: He endowed that one of our gods is one, so perhaps God is unjust, so there is no way to God Extremely unicorn, so he said: There is no god but He; And that is because our saying: There is no man, the exile requires this essence, and when this wiper is fulfilled, all of its individuals have fulfilled; If he had an individuality of that of that waters, then when that individual had obtained, the wihathhs have obtained, and that is contradicted by what is indicated by the one who has been given to it.Our saying: There is no man who requires the overall general negation, then it is said after: except for more, it is reported that the verb is the right, and in this word: The grammarians said: The words are in it, and the gathering, and the stine: there is no god for us, or there is no god in the presence except God, and know that this speech is not the right of the right; That is because you have said: The estimation is that there is no god for us except God, for this was the neutrality of our God, not to be neutralized for the divorced God, and it is not true.And your God is one god and between his saying: There is no god but he is a difference, so that there will be a be careful, and it is, and that it is It is not permissible, and if we said: the estimation is not God in the existence, then that forms are excessive, except that the forms return from another face; And that (P-158), because if you say: There is no god in existence, there is no god but He; This was a denial of the abundance of the second God, but if this guarantee was not added, you would have said: There is no god but God, a denial of the one who is the second of God, and the knowledge of the The scooping of the extent of the existence, so it was to conduct the words on its appearance, and the symptoms of this guarantee are first.If it was said: the exile of what is it is possible?If you say: the black is not in blackness, that was a ruling that the black is not in black, and it is not reasonable, but if you say: the black is not in a way that is not.A straight, we said: the exile of the wiped out is something that must be, if you say: the black is not in the way, so you have denying the existence, and the abandonment of it, His denial, then you have denying this wipering, which is called the existence, then if this is a reason, this is what is where she is, so why is it not reasonable for that This is true to correct our saying: There is no god but God on his appearance, from other things that need to be guaranteed, then if you said: If we say: the black is not in the way, then what are you?Witnesses, but the denying of the wiped out of the existence, I said: The Sufis of what is with the existence, is it a matter that is separated from the one who is not?If it was separated from them, it was a denial of that of what is, then the time is where it is it, it is possible to exile it, and then it will come back to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will come back That is a matter of separation from it, which is impossible to find the negation to it, except with the negative, either to the waters.She proven that our saying: There is no god but he is a right and a sincere from other than needing to add bit.The second research: While this word is suspended: that the negation is visible from the perception of the evidence, so you did not imagine the first, the first You imagine the numbers, so you do not imagine from the numbers except for the existence of existence, so the existence is visualized by the richness Witness, if the matter is like that, then what is the reason in the heart of this judgment in this word until the negation and the delayed of the evidence.The answer is that the matter is in the mind about what I mentioned, except that the negation of the negation of the evidence was for the provision of the neutrality and the denial of the partnership and the dump.The third research: in the word (it is), know that the memorial speaking that is attached to it was presented in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, as the one who is the Most Merciful.Know that Al -Awli is two types: an appearance and a guarantee; As for the appearance, it is the most indicative of the essences that are special as it is, like the blackness, the white, the stone, and the human being, and the antiques are the same as the significance of the thing that is the same, as it is the same, And the addressee, and the absent, is not a sign of what is the same, and it is three: I, you, and it, and I know it, then you, then it is, and the evidence is on the correctness of this Because of myself, where I am from what is not overwhelmed by the suspicion.With the other hand, and others will give you a mind in my mind and my thoughts, and too, you know who he is, so I have the most severely known (I) and the most distant from (I) (I) (I) So the authorized between them, and the complete contemplation reveals from the truth of this case, and what indicates that I know the bomber is a saying of me: He has the rhetoric in which the male and female are not chapter.Because the chapter is needed for it with the fear of the dressing, and here it is not possible to cook, so there is no need for the chapter, and as for the trinity, the gathering is, In the communicator, he said: We are drinking, and the separation is your saying: We are, but it was like that for the security of the confusion, and the addressee is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is Its femininity and its remembrance, and it is praised and collected; Because it may be in the presence of the speaking feminine and remembrance, and it is acceptable to them, so he addressed one of them, so he does not know until he shows him with a flag And his collection is good for this reason, and as for the present, he knows from the absent, this is a matter like the warning.If you know this, then say: It appears that the two things of everything, I have completed it from his knowledge other than it, whether it was present or absent; The perfect kaver is only to God.Because he is the one who says to himself: (I), and he (I) was known as the three sections, so when no one would walk to that fact, the truth is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is He said (I) only has his grace.It remains that there are people who visit the union: the human aspects, if they are enlightened by the lights of the knowledge of that fact that the rational person is the reason for the sake of the sake I know to say: I am God, except that the saying of the union is not reasonable; Because the state of the union is an art or one of them, then that is not a union, and if they remain, they are two, not one, and when this way was clogged, which is the most complete of the ritual in the point of the ritual (You) and (he), but (you) is for those present in the shrines of the disclosures and witnesses of those who were techniced about all the good luck of what God has informed of God The exalted on the authority of Yunus, peace be upon him, that he was after the injustice of the world of al -Hadath and the effects of the sediments, and he arrived at the status of the witnesses, and he said: So he called in the darkness that there is no It is alerted to you that there is no way to the prayer to the position of the testimony and the addressee except in the unseen from all that it is, and Muhammad said ﷺ: (He) to the absences, then we are searching, which is: that (he) in his right is the honor of the names, and it is indicated by his face His concept, in terms of his perception, is not forbidden from the shyness of the polytheism, and I mean by partiality that the same is a portrayal of the evil, and it is the one who is from the evil That is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first, then it is the first, then the one who is referred to is that of that name is not the truth.لِأنَّهُ لَمّا كانَ المَفْهُومُ مِن ذَلِكَ الِاسْمِ أمْرًا لا يَمْنَعُ الشَّرِكَةَ, وذاتُهُ المُعَيَّنَةُ سُبْحانَهُ وتَعالى مانِعَةٌ مِنَ الشَّرِكَةِ وجَبَ القَطْعُ بِأنَّ المُشارَ إلَيْهِ بِذَلِكَ الِاسْمِ لَيْسَ هو The truth is its grace, so all the derivative names: the mercy, the merciful, the wise, the knowledge, and the ruler, do not follow the same person, and it is not the same, and it is not.The second is the name of the science, and the knowledge is based on the denomination of the sign, so there is no difference between your saying: O Zid and between your saying: O you and what is it.And if the science is based on the denomination of the sign, then the knowledge is a branch and the name of the sign is originally, and the origin is honored by the branch, so we said: O you, oh, it is an honorable one who is the one who is the name of the name.There is no memorization that the present is responsible and (he) is the absentee, in which there is another secret, which is that (he) is correct to express it if he gets in the mind a picture of that, and he said: That image is present, and it is present, and the saying has returned until (he) also only the present.And the second: that we have indicated that the truth of the truth is out of all the parts of the calamities, and the relevant individuality cannot be called; Because the adjective requires the seduction between the descriptions and the row, and when the chain of change does not remain the paradise, and it is also not possible to tell it; Because the news requires an informant of it and its informative, and that contradicts the individualism, so it was proven that all the names that are derived from the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to As for the word (he), it is reaching that fact that is the righteous, and the righteous, from all the flaws It is an honorable one of the briefs (P-1660), which refrains from its prayers to that of that fact.And the third: that the derived conservation indicates a characteristic of the pleasure, and then what are the righteousness of the right, also unknown except with its effects [Translation failed: Request exception can
