The researcher is the Almighty: The human being was killed by what he disbelieves in it.The Muslims of the Muslims, the sacrifice of his faithful worshipers from that, as if it was said: What causes in this wonder and raising with the firstness of his first (P-55) (P-55) (P-55) (P-55) A cavity is excreted, and in it between the two bonds is the carrier of excuse, so there is no male mentioned the highest of what is good for it to be a treatment for their liking, and what is good for them to be done The creation of a person is reconciled to be inferred from the existence of the law, and that it is inferred by the saying by the mission, the bastard, and the spread.The second question: The interpreters said: The verse was descended in Ataba ibn Abi Lahab He is associated with their causes, and others said: Rather, what is meant is the slander of every rich righteousness, raising a poor in the cause To raise them, it is obligatory for the judgment to prevail in the cause of the heart.And the second: that the exalted of the way of their ways in the cause of the condition of the human being in the appetite and the end of what he said: From a sperm created by his nations, then he died, and he granted him to this, then he rejoiced, Judgment.And the third of it: It is that the sake of the memorizer is more extensive, and the memorizer is reserved for it, so it is obligatory to carry it on it.The third question: His Exalted: The human being was killed by a supplication for him, and it is one of the most common calls, because the killing is the end of the world, and what is disbelieving in the world, The grace of God, and his saying: The human being killed by alerting him that they deserve the greatest of the types of punishment, and his saying: What I disbelieve is alerted him to the types of Supplication for a person is to be bound by the miracle, and the grace of everyone is how it is worthy of that?And admiration also is to be ignorant of ignorance of something, so the scientist is how how is that?.The answer: That and he responded to the words of the words of the Arabs and achieved it, what we mentioned is that it was exalted, indicating that they deserved the greatest of the types of punishment for the sake The doves, and know that every modern one has three times, his first and his last, and that he was the highest of these three times for the human being.As for the first arrangement: it is his saying: from anything that he created, and it is an understanding, and its abuse is the increase in the report in the opposition.Then he answered that the interrogation answered by his saying: From the sperm of his creation, and there is no doubt that the sperm is something that is humiliating, and it is imposed from it that whoever is the origin of this [from] Set, as the den for and forced it is not appropriate for it.Then he said: (He appreciated it) and it has faces: one of them: Al -Farah said: He appreciated it as a phases of sperm and then attached to the last of his creation And mention, female, happy, or naughty.And the second: Al -Zajaj said: The meaning was destined to level as he said: You disbelieved in the one who created you from the dust, then from a sperm, and then set you up a man [Al -Kahf: 37].And the third: It is enticed to be the intention and the estimation of every member in the kmiyah and the entity with the best of its reconciliation, and its counterpart: Performing [Furn Its: 2].As for the second arrangement: it is the intermediate aspect, it is the Almighty saying: Then the path is easy and in which there are two questions: the first question: And it is easy to make it easier.The second question: They mentioned in his interpretation of sayings: One of them: Some of them said: What is meant is the way of his exit from the stomach of his mother, they said: He was the head His mother is above and his leg is from under it, so if the time comes to turn, then whoever gave him that greeting except God?It is confirmed by this state that his choice is alive from that narrow implementation of the wonder of miracles.And the second: Abu Muslim said: What is meant by this verse is what is meant by his saying: We are guided by the two astonishment [the country: 10], so it is the one who is distinguished between the good of the good With the world, and between every good and evil that is related to the religion, that is, we have made it able to be able to do the paths of good and evil, and the facilitation is in which it is entered and the righteousness and the ritual The prophets, and the removal of (P-56) books.And the third of it: This is specialized in the matter of religion, because the sake of the way is note that the intended is the conditions of the world [no] things that are obtained in the hereafter.As for the second arrangement: it is the last arrangement, it is the saying of the Almighty: then he died, then he set it up, then if he wanted to spread it.And I know that this is the third of the third, as well as three times: the mud, the rituals, and the spread.Between the state of expression and the reward, and the rituals said: God made it a grave and did not make it from those who are thrown to the bird and the predecessors, because the grave is what the grave is what the grave is what the grave The Muslim, he said: He did not say, and he granted it, because the grave is the drain in his hand, and the grave is God Almighty, it is said: He granted the dead if he is buried, and he will be granted, and he will be blessed with him, and he will be blessed.The grave, and the Arabs say: The sins of the camel and God blessed him, and I had a horn of the revolution, and God is the most heavy, and I repelled it, and it is my soul, Hope: Then, if he wants to publish it from the mission [and] the resurrection, but he said if he wanted a notice that his time is not known to us, so he will be able to do it and his delay, to his delay, As for the one who is mentioned before that, he knows its districts from some of the faces, because the death, even if the human being knows that the human being is in the sentence that he does not know that he does not know that he does not know that he does not know.A known limit.
