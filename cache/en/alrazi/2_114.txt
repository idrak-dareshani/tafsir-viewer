The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: Whoever darkens from those who prevented the mosque of God to mention in it his name and seek in its murder, these were not that they would enter it except for the disagreement The hereafter is a great torment that I know that in this verse there are questions: the first question: the proud of those who are not intended is that it is not intended from this verse, the one who is the same Bayan was repeated that those who did such, for God does it with it, but what is meant by him is that some of them are those who prevented the mosque, and he sought in its murder, then the one who is in the time of God, then the one who is in the time of God However, they disagreed that those who prevented the mosque were prevented from the mosque and sought in his wages who they are?And they mentioned four of them: the first: Ibn Abbas said: The king of the Christians invaded the house of the sanctuary, so he broke it, and he was thrown into it, and he was restricted, He was burned, and the sanctuary of the sanctuary was still a hole until the people of Islam in the time of Omar.And the second: Al -Hassan, Qatada and Al -Saddi said: It came down in Bakhtasar, where he was raised by the house of the sanctuary, and some Christians helped him on that.Abu Bakr al -Razi said in the rulings of the Qur’an: These two vagins are Gaza.Because there is no disagreement between the people of science in the whole, that the covenant of a mortar was before the birth of the Christ - peace be upon him - with a long time.How can they be with a victorious in the way of the house of the sanctuary, and also, because the Christians are hidden in the greatest house How do they help him.And the third of it: that it descended in the Arabs of the Arabs who prevented the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, from the supplication to God with Mecca and resorted to the migration, so they will not be blessed.They remember God in the mosque, the righteous, and the truthful - may God be pleased with him - was built a mosque at his house, so he was forbidden, and whoever harms him, and he who harms him His saying is up to the Almighty: Do not make your prayers and do not be afraid of it [Al -Israa: 110] It was said: And whoever is darkened from these entrepreneurs who are forbidden by Muslims who unite God and do not share anything with him, and they will be blessed And they occupy their hearts by thinking about it, and their eagle is remembered for him, and all of their body by humiliation of his greatness and authority.And the sequence of it: The father of a Muslim said: What is meant by those who repelled him from the mosque is the forbidden when he went to him from the city in the year Excite and repel you from the forbidden mosque [Al -Fath: 25] and his saying: And what they do not torture them, and they will repeat them from the mosque in the forbidden [Al -Anfal: 34] God is raised from his hand, and he shows from his words, as he said in the hypocrites: Let us glow you with them, then they will not visit you except for a few who are fabricated.And they were killed by killing [Al -Ahzab: 60] and I have a fifth face, and it is close to the sponsorship of the systems: which is to be said: when the kiss was transferred to the kaaba, then they are the same, so they are the same.People are forbidden to pray when they are directed to the kaaba, (P-10), and perhaps they also sought to repel the kaaba that they were bitten by some of the knees, Also in the analogy of the mosque of the Messenger ﷺ so that they do not pray in it, and they will be married to the kiss, so God is with that, and this is the same as the way of the way of it From what was before it, and that is because God is transcendent, and he did not remember in the preceding verses on this verse except the conquests How can this single verse be met by the one that is intended for the openings of the acts of the partners in their replacement, the Messenger of the mosque in the forbidden, and the mother Farewell to the house of the sanctuary, also weakened by what Abu Bakr al -Razi explained, and he did not remain except what we said.The second question: In how this verse is connected to what is before it, it is a face: as for those who carried it to the Christians and the trap of the house of the sacred, he said: He said: They claimed that they are from the people of Paradise only, and he was told to them: How do you be like that with your treatment in the analogy of the mosque and the pursuit in its tallness.As for those who carried it on the mosque, the forbidden, and the brief of the mosque, he said: The remembrance of the Arabs of the Arabs was done in his saying: Likewise, he said who do not know the same: It was said: The remembrance of all the infidels and their defamation of them, so a time directed the defamation to the Jews and the Christians, and once to the participants.The third question: His saying: The mosques of God is a general, so whoever said: What is meant by all the mosque, and among them is those who carried it on what we mentioned from the mosques and the mosques of the mosque Mecca, and they said: My father had a goodness - may God be pleased with him - a mosque in Mecca that God prayed in it, and they raised him before the migration, and from them, and from them, and from them, and from them Just, and he is the saying of my father, a Muslim, where the prohibition was pleased with the Messenger of the Messenger from the mosque in the year One mosque?We said: There are faces in it: one of them: this is the one who says to those who harm one righteous one: and whoever is darkened by those who harm the righteous.And the second: that the mosque is the position of the prostration.The loyal question: His saying: that his name be mentioned in the place of the monument, and they differed in the worker in it with statements: the first: that it is the second of the one who does not.I prevented him such, ومِثْلُهُ: وما مَنَعَنا أنْ نُرْسِلَ بِالآياتِ [الإسراء: 59] وما مَنَعَ النّاسَ أنْ يُؤْمِنُوا [الإسراء: 94].The second: Al -Akhfash said: It is permissible to be on the authority of “from”, as if it was said: He prevented the mosques of God from mentioning his name.The third: to be at the beginning of “the mosque of God”.Al -Rabaa: Al -Zajaj said: It is permissible to be in the sense: His dedication is to mention his name, and the one in it is “forbidden”.The fifth question: the pursuit of the mosque may be for two people: one of them: preventing the worshipers, the worshipers, and those who are the ones who have the same Explanation.And the second: with destruction and disturbance, and no one will say: How is it correct to be interpreted at the house of God, the forbidden, and the absence of it appears; Because preventing people from setting up the slogan of worship in which he will be angry with him, and it was said: Abu Bakr - may God be pleased with him - had a place of prayer, and he was a prayer.The sixth question: the appearance of the verse requires that this action is the greatest of the types of injustice, and it has forms; Because the evil is an injustice of what the Almighty said: The evil is a great injustice [Luqman: 13] with the fact that the blessing is greater than this action, as well as adultery, and the killing of the soul is more than this The maximum in the door is that it is a year that the specialization entered, so it does not praise it.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Those are what they had to enter it, except for those who are disobedient, so I know that in the verse the books: (P-11) The first question: the appearance of the words that those who believe in those who believed The mosque is absent from those who are forbidden to enter it, but those who make it a year in all of them, so they remember the interpretation of this It is for them to enter the mosques of God, except for those who are disobedient in the event of the hippo and the return of the people from the believers, to thrive with them, and they will be lost.The believers are from it, and the meaning: the right and the duty were only that, without the injustice of the disbelief and their affection.And the second: that this is a view of God for the Muslims that he will show them on the mosque and on the path of mosques, and that the two participants humiliate the authority of the one who does not have the same One of them is only a disagreement, he is afraid that he will be taken and he will be punished, or he will be killed if he was not converted to, and God has succeeded in this promise.The pilgrimage of Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, did not perform a sharing after the year, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded the sacrifice of the Juda The mosque is not seduced by one of the participants to perform Hajj, and the mosque enters the forbidden, and this is the interpretation of my father Muslim in the pregnancy of the mosque from the one About the mosque in the year in the year And they prevailed to them, where they would become disagreement from him and his nation.And the third: that this fear is carried on the young and humiliated by the young and humiliated.And the one who has been seen: that the entry of the mosque is forbidden, except in something that includes fear, as they are entrusted to enter the commander, the trial, and the argument; Because all of that guarantees fear, and the evidence is upon him the saying of the Almighty: the polytheists would not have been to build the mosques of God.Fifth: Qatada and Al -Saddi said: His saying: Except those who are disobedient in the sense that the Christians do not enter the house of the sanctuary except those who are disobedient, and there is no one in it, Take a murderous; Because the house of the sanctuary is more than a hundred years in the hands of the Christians, where there were no one of the Muslims in it, in which it is not possible, until the disagreement, until it is disgraced The goodness of religion, may God have mercy on us in our time.And its sixth: that his saying: They would not have entered it except disagreement, even if he was memorized, he would notice the news, but what is meant by him is forbidden from them And between him; His saying: It was not for you to harm the Messenger of God [Al -Ahzab: 53].* * * As for his words, the Almighty: They have a hole in the world, so they disagreed with the treachery, so he said: What causes them to humiliate them with their prevention of the mosque, and he said: The right of the dhimmis, and by killing in the right of the people of war, and know that all of that is an assignment, because the treasury is only what is going on the path of the wise one This is his class enters under it, and that is a deterrent from God, who is glorified by their steadfastness on the infidels; Because the present shame disdgested with what is required and required, and the great torment was lost, and God has described it with what was done in the course of the end of the time; Because those who came to their remembrance and described them with the great injustice, he indicated that they deserve the great punishment, and in the verse two questions: the first question: Wahwah: The first: in the Bayan, the grace of the mosque, and the Qur’an, the news and the mind indicate, as for the Qur’an, the verses are: one of them: the saying of the Almighty: One [jinn: 18].The mosque added to itself in the words of the sealing, then that seal confirmed with his saying: Do not call with God one.And the second: His Excellency said: Rather, the mosque of God is the one who believes in God and the last day [Repentance: 18] so he made the mosque of the mosque, the glory of the faith, the glory of the faith, the glory of the Lord In the restriction of faith in them; Because the word “is“ for the confinement.And the third of it: His Exalted Him: In the homes of God, God is called to be raised and reminded of his name in which he praises him in it with lunch and the: Al -Nur: 36].And its elevation: This is the verse that we are in its interpretation, and it is the saying Whoever prevented the mosque of God to remember in it his name, because its appearance requires that the curtain be in the way of the mosque is worse than the one who is the one.Because he said: Whoever is darkened, the shared; Because he is upset, he said: The evil is a great injustice.As for the news: one of them: the Sheikh narrated in their Sahih, when Uthaman ibn Afan - may God be pleased with him - wanted to build the mosque, and he thought that the people, and the people, and the people, Oman, may God be pleased with him: I heard the Prophet ﷺ say: “Whoever built God, mosques, God built his body in paradise.” In another novel: “God built a house for him in Paradise.” And the second: What Abu Hurairah narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: The mind is in the greatness of the mosque, and his leadership: that the place and the elderly are honored by the remembrance of God Almighty, so if the mosque is a place for the remembrance of the remembrance of God God, if he enters the mosque, work with the remembrance of God, and the market is against that; Because it is the position of sale, purchase, and acceptance of the world, and that is what is inherited from God from God and the symptoms of thinking about the path of God, even if God is the same.He becomes unaware of the remembrance of God - there was no crime, the mosque was honored by the positions, and the markets are the lower of the positions.The second: In the virtue of walking to the mosque: (a) on the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: He said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: The exhibitors of God, his steps were below his sin, and the last one raised his cod (B) Abu Hurairah said: He said: “Whoever goes to the mosque, may God prepare for him in paradise with a hose, whenever he goes up or goes” in the last.(C) Abi Bin Kaab said: “A man did not know one of the people of the city of those who prayed to the kiss, a distance from him from the mosque, and it was not wrong Peace be upon him, and he said to him: If you were bought by a roll, I would ride it in the darkness and the darkness, so he said: And God will not love that my house is in the shadow of the mosque, That is, he asked him, and he said: O Messenger of God, as he writes my effect, my sins, and my return to my family, my appetite, and my adulterers, so he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him.(D) Jabir said: “The bouquet has been overwhelmed by the mosque, so the children of Salama wanted to move to the proximity of the mosque, so he reached that.You want to They moved to the proximity of the mosque, and they said: Yes, we wanted that, he said: O sons of peace, your path is written by your effects.On the authority of Abu Saeed Al -Khudari: that this verse was descended in their right: We revive the death and write what they came and their effects [Yass: 12].(E) On the authority of Abu Musa Al -Ash'ari - may God be pleased with him - on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ He said: “The greatest people are rewarded in prayer.The imam is in a group of great reward for those who pray it, then he sleeps.(F) Aqabah ibn Amir al -Jahni, that he is peace be upon him, he said: “If a man purifies, then passes to the mosque, he will be in the prayer, then his writer wrote to him or his writer, or his writer, or his writer.They make it to the mosque ten years, and the base who sponsors the prayer is like the qidat, and it is written from the worshipers from when he comes out of his house until he returns.(G) On the authority of Saeed bin Al -Masib, he said: A man from the dead supporters, so he said to his family: Who is in the house?They said: (P-13) Your family, and as for your brother and your righteousness in the mosque, he said: Raise me, so he supported him as a man from them to him, so he opened his eyes, And upon him, and they said to him: Good.He said: I am inherited you today in a hadith that I spoke to him as one since I heard from the Messenger of God ﷺ to be affiliated, and I have not spoken to you today, except for the one who has heard.He says: “Whoever turns in his house is good, then the ablution is good, then he came out to the mosque, praying in the group of Muslims, and the man did not raise it to him Well, and his man did not put the captive, except God, from him, is a sin until the mosque comes, so if he prayed with the imam’s prayer, then he will be forgotten, then he will be forgiven, then he will be forgiven, then he will be forgiven, then he will be.He died some, it was like that.(H) On the authority of Abu Hurairah, he is upon him, peace be upon him, who said: This is short of something.“ The line is to the mosque and wait for the prayer after the prayer, so the lord is for you, so the lord was narrated by a Muslim.(J) “Abu Salma ibn Abd al -Rahman said to Dawid ibn Salih: Do you know that you have come down: O you who believe, be patient and be patient, and they have said: My nephew, he said: I heard Abu Hurairah say: It was not in the time of the Prophet ﷺ a conquest in which he is attached to it, but he is waiting for the prayer after the prayer.(Oh) Burida, peace be upon him said: The mosque in the dark night is obligatory.(Yep) Al -Awsa’i said: It was said: Fifth had the companions of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and those who followed with charity: the obligation of the group and the Sunnah of the Sunnah, and the glory of the mosque, and the mosque, The path of God.(Y) Abu Hurairah, peace be upon him, said: (Hand) Abu Dhrar, peace be upon him said: (Jeh) Abu Saeed Al -Khudari: peace be upon him said: “If you see a man, the mosque is used to, and they will bear witness to him with faith, for God is the Almighty, he said: He is the Almighty.And the last day "[Tawbah: 18].(U) On the authority of the Messenger of the Messenger of God ﷺ that they said: The mosque is the house of God, and it is a right to God to honor those who visited him in it.(Yaz) Anas, peace be upon him said: “The Ammar of God is the family of God's house.” (Yah) Anas, “Peace be upon him said:“ God says: As if I have the people of the earth as a torment, then if I look at the Ammar of my house and those who are with the people, and the people who are in the way, and the people who are in the way I got away from them.(Yatt) On the authority of Anas: He said, peace be upon him: (K) Salman wrote to my father Al -Daradaa: My brother, so that your house is mosque, so I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ say: The mosques are their homes with the sacrifice and the mercy, and the permissibility on the path to the pleasure of God Almighty.(Ka) Said ibn Al -Masib said: On the authority of Abdullah bin Salam: The mosque is a good for people, and if they have the people of the angels, then if they are lost, then they will ask them.And if they are in need, they helped them.(Kab) Al -Hasan, peace be upon him said: “It is a time for people to be their hadith in their mosques in their worlds, so they will not be sitting, so they will not be for them.” (Kaj) Abu Hurairah: peace be upon him said: “The hypocrites have signs that they know, they greet them with a curse, and their downs Hitting, and prayer is only a dubbing, they do not comply nor be familiar with, wood with night, clouds with nights.(Kad) Abu Saeed Al -Khudari and Abu Hurairah: peace be upon him said: قَلْبُهُ مُعَلَّقٌ بِالمَسْجِدِ إذا خَرَجَ مِنهُ حَتّى يَعُودَ إلَيْهِ, ورَجُلانِ تَحابّا (p-14)فِي اللَّهِ, اجْتَمَعا عَلى ذَلِكَ وتَفَرَّقا, ورَجُلٌ ذَكَرَ اللَّهَ خالِيًا فَفاضَتْ عَيْناهُ, And a man called by a woman with good and beautiful, and he said: I fear God, and a man who believes with a charity, so I fear her until you do not know the north of what He spends his right.This is a hadith that the sheikh has been brought out in in the two health.(Ke) Aqabah ibn Amir, on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ: He is waiting for prayer as qnat, and he is written from the worshipers until he returns to his house.(Ko) Abdullah bin Al -Makb al -Makbi narrated on the authority of Hakim ibn Zarq ibn al -Hakam.The mosque?He said: He who prayed at a funeral has a carat, and whoever follows it until they are granted, then he has two carats, and the sitting in the mosque is loved to me, praise God, and he will be forgiven You say: Amen, O God, forgive him, O God, have mercy on him, so if you do so, say: Oh God, forgive Said bin Al -Masib.The third: In the Zawyan of the mosque: (a) Ibn Abbas: He said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: And from the saying of the Almighty: in constructed pear [Women: 78], which is its construction.(B) Omar commanded a mosque, and he said to the builders: People are from the rain, and you are red or yellowed, so the people are fascinated.(C) It was narrated that Uthaman was seen from a plaster hanging in the mosque, so he commanded it and cut it.(D) Abu Al -Daradaa said: If you have been replaced by your crusters, and you decorate your mosques, then the domination is upon you.(E) Abu Qalbah said: We were with us with Anas ibn Malik to the Zawyah, so the prayer of the morning came, so we passed by a mosque, and Anas said: If this is in this way?Some people said: Until the other mosque came, and Anas said: Which mosque?They said: A mosque is happening now, and Anas said: The Messenger of God ﷺ He said: ““ My nation will come to my nation, and they will be in the mosque, and they will not be built.” Al -Rabaa: In the greeting of the mosque, in the two of the two of the prayers of the peace of the peace be upon him, he said: “If one of you enters the mosque, then he will be blessed.He is sitting.Ibn Sirin and Ata ibn Abi Rabah and al -Nakhdi and al -Qatada, and with it, Malik, Al -Tuiri and the companions of the opinion said.Fifth: When he says if he enters the mosque, Fatima narrated the daughter of the Messenger of God ﷺ on the authority of her father, she said: “ Lord, forgive me my sins, and open the gates of your mercy, and if he comes out, pray on Muhammad and peace, and he said: Lord, forgive me my sins, and open to me.Sixth: In the virtue of the lords in the mosque, to wait for the prayer.(A) Abu Hurairah: The prayers and peace be upon him: “The angels pray on one of you as long

rituals, And the purchase is in it, and for the people to shake the mosque on the day of the Friday before the prayer.And know that he has repeated people from the people of knowledge, which is good and the purchase in the mosque, and with him he says Ahmad, Ishaq and Ata Bin Yaray, and if he passed upon him, he said: In the market of the world, but this is the market of the hereafter, and Salsam ibn Abd Allah ibn Umar ibn al -Khattab - may God be pleased with them - was pleased with them - peace be upon them.He wanted to be covered or sought a poetry or raised a voice, so that he would come out to this wah The day of the group before the prayer for the remembrance of the science, but it is seen by the remembrance, prayer and listening to the speech, then there is no goodness with the sake of the prayer The lost in the mosque, and raised the voice with the remembrance of the remembrance - so it is a mantle, on the authority of Abu Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - he said: Whoever hears a man who sheds in God responded to you, for the mosque was not built for this, and on the authority of Abu Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - also that he is upon him the prayers and peace, he said: So they said: God does not praise your merchants.Their rights, and some of the predecessors have been disturbed in the mosque, and some of them saw that he did not believe in the liquid in the mosque, and the mosque is in the mosque, and the ritual of the mosque, The mosque, Omar said in his intention to be a limit: the other than the mosque, and it is mentioned about me - may God be pleased with him - like him, and he said: Fifth: Whoever is held in the limits, or the exodus is held in it, or it is made in the slogan, or it is sought in the lost, or it is taken as a

هُرَيْرَةَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ ﷺ أنَّهُ قالَ: ”"إذا قامَ أحَدُكم إلى الصَّلاةِ فَلا He spits before him, for he will survive God as long as he is in his prayer, nor on his right (P-16), because he is on his right as a king, but to spit from his north or his rituals.And on the authority of Anas, “He is peace and blessings be upon him, he saw a tribe in the kiss, so he was shocked by him until he was visible on his face, so he said: His Lord will survive; So no one will be made in his kisses, but he is on his behalf, or under his feet.He does so, "" Al -Bukhari brought it out in his authenticity.Ten: in garlic and connection.In the two of the two people, on the authority of Anas and Ibn Omar and Jabir, peace and blessings be upon him said: “Whoever eat from this tree stretched, then we do not bring our mosque.The angels are hurt from what is hurt by humanity.Let our mosque be dismissed.“Bring it up to some of those present, and he said to him: All, I will survive those who do not survive.” الحادِيَ عَشَرَ: في المَساجِدِ في الدُّورِ.On the authority of Hesham ibn Urwah, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Aisha - may God be pleased with her - she said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ commanded the mosque in the role, and to be cleaned.” Anas ibn Malik said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ was in the mosque, and his companions were with him when he came to an Arab, and he came in the mosque, so the companions of the Messenger of God said: “Do not lead him,” then he called him and said: “This mosque does not reconcile with something of excuse, urine, and empty, but it is for the Qur’an, the Qur’an and the remembrance of God.” The Messenger of God ﷺ with a sign of water, and they stood on it.* * * It is forbidden to enter the forbidden and the mosque, and the Shafi’i embraced its faces: the first: the saying of the Almighty: but the partners are unclean, so they do not come close This [Repentance: 28] Al -Shafi’i said: It may be the intention of the forbidden mosque; For his saying, the Almighty: Glory be to whom he caused his servant at night from the forbidden mosque [Al -Israa: 1] Rather, I was captivated by him from the house of Khadjah.The verse is either on the mosque only, or on all of it, and on the two estimates, the intended is the one.Because the disagreement is all in them, then it was said: What is meant by the pilgrimage, and this is why he said: After this year, this is because the pilgrimage is done in the Sunnah once Lojoh: One of them: it is a leaving for the most prominent.The second: It is proven in the origins of jurisprudence to form the judgment on the description of this description of that The mosque is the rituals of their impurity, and that requires that as long as they are partners, they were drained from the mosque.The third: It is up to the pilgrimage, if the pilgrimage was mentioned in the bouquet, in which the greatest of the pilgrimage is located, and it is known.The lord: The evidence is that the person is the one who enters the sanctuary, not the pilgrimage, then - the saying of the Almighty: And if you fear a horse, then it will enrich you from God.To trade.And the second: His Excellency said: Those are what they had to enter it except disagreements, and this requires that they be prevented from entering the mosque, and that they were when they entered, they were disgraced The evidence is upon him, if it was said: This verse is devoted to those who have been raised by the sanctuary of the sanctuary, or from the one who prohibits the Messenger of God ﷺ from the servants, and the servants of the slave, He said: It was not for them to enter it except for those who are not intended from the fear of the lame, but rather the fear of the partisanship and the lax.We said: The answer is about the first: that his saying is up to the Almighty: Whoever is darkened by those who prevent the mosques of God is an apparent in the general, so he summarizes him with some of the rituals (p- 17).And on the authority of the second: that the phenomenon said: It was not for them to enter it except disagreements that require that this be fearful, but it is obtained from the income, and on what they say, they will not say He was born from the income, but rather from something else, then their words fell.And the third of it: His Excellency said: What the two participants would not have built the mosques of God, witnessing themselves with themselves with disbelief [Repentance: 17] And its connection.The second: its presence and its obligation, as it says: So that the mosque is mosques, and that is, that is: he brings it and obligates it, and the Prophet said ﷺ: He has faith in faith, and that is for his saying: Rather, the mosque of God is the one who believes in God and the last day [Tawbah: 18], so make the presence of the mosque.And the one that is: that the sanctuary is required to be glorified; For him, peace and blessings be upon him, in the supplication: “O God, increase this house, honor and great” and fearful “and his vote is what is required of his hatred, Entry has an infringement of the house for the contempt; Because they
