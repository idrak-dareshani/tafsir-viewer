The Quranic researcher is the second grace, and his saying: Our separation is, so we separated between some of it and some until you have become in it, for you and the villages of us.It is said: He separated between the two things and separated between things; Because your question was twelve on the number of tribes, if you said: What is the meaning: “with you”?We said: In its Jahan: One of them: that they were rubbing it and separating the water at their hearts, so as if it was separated by them as it separated from the one who separated from the one.The second: We separated him with your causes and because of your success, then we are research: the first search: it was narrated that he was upset when he wanted to exile the Pharaohs, and the stomach in the case, and the case is in the case.One of them believes in the matter of Moses, peace be upon him, the sons of Israel, to redeem the rituals, and that is for two wives: one of them: to remove their successors.The second: that their money remains in their hands, then Jabriel, peace be upon him, went down to the living and said to Moses: I will leave your people at night, and it is what is meant by the saying [Al -Shua’ar: 52] And they were the same as a thousand people because they were twelve Sabe Pharaoh, and he said: Do not follow them until the rooster shouted.Al -Rawi said: By God, what he shouted for his night is a rooster.A thousand domes, and Qutdah said: A thousand thousand and a thousand thousand people have a thousand people, each one of them on a horse, so they followed them.It is the saying of the Almighty: So they followed them with the two poets [Al -Shua’ar: 60], that is, after the threshold of the sun.When Al-Jumaan's rituals (P-67) said, Moses, we are left [Al-Shua’ar: 61], and Moses said: All that my Lord will guide me [Al-Shua’ar: 62], so when he walked, he said: He has Yoshi Bin Nun: Where is your Lord?Moses said: To you and referred to the sea, then Yoshi ibn Nun, and his horse was in the sea, and he was walking in the water until he reached the immersion, so he praised the horse, and he said: Where is your Lord?And he said: The sea, and he said: And God did not lie, so he did three times, so God revealed to him: that he was stirred with your sticks, and he was closed, and he was closed.[Al -Shua’ar: 67], and the sea breathed into the twelve mountains in each one of them is a way, so he said to him: He entered, and there was a solution in it, so the boy was blown away, and the sacrifice was dried up.Speaking, as he said, "So, he said:" So he was a way in the sea, wearing [Taha: 77], so he took every way of them as a way and entered it, and they said: " Moses hit his stick on the sea, and he became between the methods, and he saw some of them.Then Pharaoh followed them, and when he reached the beach of the sea, he saw a Plice standing, so he would have been from the income, so he understood that he would not enter the sea, so he will come to the sacrifice, so he did not enter the sail So Pharaoh was presented while he was a solution, so he followed the horse of Pharaoh and entered the sea.With your first, when they entered the sea with the whole of God, God commanded the water until we descended upon them, so he said: “And we will be blessed with the family of you and you are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The day Ashura, the fast of Moses, peace be upon him, this day, thank you for God.The second research: Know that the location includes a lot of blessings in religion and the world, but the blessings of the world in the right of peace be upon him, so it is from it: The Standard, who are behind them, and their soldiers, and their feet, the sea, then if you stand, the enemy and your family will be blessed with the tightness of the torment, and if they walked.From that, then God escaped them with the corporation of the sea, so there is no more powerful than that.And the second: that God Almighty has specialized in this great grace and miracle, and this is the reason for the appearance of their honor to God Almighty.And the third of it: that they witnessed that God Almighty has your people, and it is known that the salvation is like this ease of the greatest of blessings, so how if he gets with it, and the greatness.And its booster: that they inherited them their land, their visits, their blessings and their aspirations.Fifth: It is upset when the family of Pharaohs impeded it, so he saved the children of Israel from them, and that is a great blessing; Because he was afraid of them, even if he was upset and his people saved him from that power and what you have qualified for Pharaoh and his people, and the fear is from the rest of it And they intended to harm Moses, peace be upon him and his people, but God Almighty when he divorced them, so he has enjoined the substance of fear in the kidneys.And its sixth: that this was placed in the presence of the children The people of Moses, when they witnessed that miracle, the brightest of their hearts, the suspicions and suspicions are removed from their hearts.Moses, peace be upon him, is close to the fierce science, as if he had lifted themselves from them, she loads the narrow look and the hard cursing.And the second: that when they were appointed, he became a call for them to steadfastness on the belief of Moses and the leadership of him, and that became a reason for the people of Pharaoh to leave the peace On the deny of Pharaoh.And the third of it: they knew that the affairs are in the hand of God, because there is no glory in the world that was fully fully than what was for Pharaohs and no intensity is more severe than what I was in my son Israel, then God Almighty is in one moment that made the dear humiliation and humiliation, dear (P-68) The servitude of the Creator and the trust in it in all matters, and the blessings that occur to the nation of Muhammad ﷺ from the remembrance of this story is a lot: ﷺ On the people of the book, because he was known from the case of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, that he was my mother, and he did not read, and he did not write, and he did not mix with the people of the book The detailed is what is only known from the books that they have been told about the revelation and that it is true, and that became an argument for him, peace be upon him.And secondly: If we imagine what happened to them and them from these great matters, we know that those who are immortalized by God are the hardship of the world and the hereafter, and whoever obeys him, so he has lost That became a desire for us in obedience and alienated from disobedience.And the third of it: that the nation of Moses, peace be upon him, is with them that they were dedicated to this miracle and the dahr God, as the gods have them [Al -Arif: 138].For Muhammad ﷺ and what they were immoral in the matter of bit, and this indicates that the nation of Muhammad ﷺ is better than the nation of peace be upon him.And the remainder of the two questions: the first question: that the sea was raised in the significance of the existence of the subordinate of the subordination and in the significance of the righteousness of Moses as the matter Time of cost?.The answer is: As for our saying, it is a backward, and the dismissed, the Kaabi answered the whole answer that in the costs of those who distance from the mantle and the fulle The Israel was like that, so they needed to be alerted to the meaning of the great verses, such as separating the sea and raising the phase and the mud of the mud, do you not see that they are after that The idols of them said: Yamusi, make us a god as God has the gods [Al -Araf: 138].Because they were in the end of the cumin in the minds, then the crime of God is the highest of them with the precise evidence and the pleasant miracles.The second question: that Pharaoh, when he witnessed, was raised and was sane, so it is imperative that he knew that that was what was of his action, but it is necessary to be able to be able to do so.How did he stay on the disbelievers with that?If you said: He was a disobedient with his Lord, but he was disbelieving on the path of stubbornness and ingratitude.I said: If this is known to his heart, how can you take the same thing in the welcoming and entering the sea with It was in that hour like the one who is obliged to know the existence of the laws and the truth of the peace be upon him.And the answer: The love of something blinds and fasts, so the love of the ignorant and the lipstick is carried by the arrival of that savage.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: You are looking at it in his faces: one of them: that you see the abandonment of the sea with the parts of its people.And the second: that the people of Moses, peace be upon him, asked him that God be upon them, so they would ask them, and Moses, peace be upon him, asked his Lord to show them to them, so he memorized them with the sea and walked.And they were raised with them, so they looked at them, and the sea did not accept one of them for the disbelief of their disbelief Wall you a verse [Yunus: 92], that is, we bring you out of the mail to the capacity of the hydro to the people of the people, and it will be a lesson for them.And the third of it: that what is meant and you are close to them, where you face them and meet them, even if they do not see them with their eyesight.They look at you, and when you relieve you say that if his family approaches him, even if they do not see him and its meaning is returned to knowledge.
