The researcher of the Quran, his exalted: And when they protested to Galot and his soldiers, they said, our Lord, empty us with patience and prove our feet, and we will be victorious to the people who are infidels in it.The prestige in the war is that every one of them is highlighted to the owner of the time of the fighting, and the origin is in it that the territory of the hydro of which is not a veil in which the stools are said to be the stools, so the righteousness was from the righteousness One of them is in the earthly land, which is that each one of them is where his owner sees.The second question: The scholars and the pillars are from Askar Taltout, when they decided with the people and weakness that it is as a few of the category that prevailed in a many categories, The conquest and the victory are only with the insistence of God, there is no crime when the most prominent of Askar, Taltout, to Askar Jalut, and they saw the few in their side, and there is a lot, and there is no Work with the supplication and the burden, and they said: Our Lord emptied us with patience and his counterpart, what God has told about another people who said that they said when the meeting with the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been blessed With him, many Lords [Al -Imran: 146] to his saying: And their saying was only that they said our Lord, forgive us our sins and our secrets in our affairs and prove our feet [Al-Imran: 147] Thus, (P-158) did the Messenger of God ﷺ in all the citizens, and it was narrated from him in the story of a bird that peace be upon him, and he did not pray He met an enemy who said: “Oh God, I seek refuge in you from their evils and make you in their graves.” The third question: emptying: the casting, it is said: I emptied the vessel if you pour what is in it, and its origin from the void, it is said: so -and -so empty; It is meaning that it is free of what he occupies, and emptying: the brother of the vessel in what is in it, but rather they are in the stain of everything in it.If you know this, then say: His saying: We empty us with patience that indicates the exaggeration in the request of patience from two sides: one of them: that if he poured the thing in the thing, then he is in the thing, then he will be in the thing, then he will be in the thing.Where he does not go away from him, and this indicates confirmation.The second: that the emptying of the vessel is its brotherhood, and that is in the stain of everything in it, so it means: empty us with patience: that is, the heart of us is a boy and his absence.The following question: Know that the things that are required at the stars are three matters of three things: the first of them: that the human being is a patience on the one This is the highest pillar of the strained, for if it is a cheese, it is not a sign of origin.And the second: that it is a hardship of machines, tools, and good dealers, which can stand and prove and do not become a refuge in the virgin.And the third of it: that its strength over the power of its enemy until it can make the enemy be cleared.If you know this, then say: The first arrangement is what is meant by his saying: empty us with patience.And the second: it is intended by saying it: our feet are proven.The third: it is intended to say it: and our victory over the infidels.* * * Fifth question: The companions have been involved that the actions of worshipers are created for God Almighty by saying: Our Lord empties our patience and that is not for me, because there is no patience for me, because there is no patience for me, because there is no patience for me.Stability, and there is no meaning for stakeholders except for silences and stability, and this verse is indicative of that this intention called patience from God Almighty, and it is the saying of God: And the tranquility that takes place at that intention is also with the act of God Almighty, and it is his saying: We have proven our feet, and this is clear that the will is from the servant of the servant, and the servant of the servant, and the servant of the servant, What is meant by patience and stabilized the feet is the reasons for the patience, and the reasons for the steadfastness In the reason for that of them is the obligatory, so that it becomes a reason for the procedure of Muslims on them, and he becomes a call for them to be patient with the fighting and leaving the defect.And the second: that some of their enemies are kind in the knowledge of what they are on, so that the difference and separation fall between them, and this becomes a reason for the procedure.And the third of it: that the transgression of them and their paths and their people are made of calamity, such as death and abandonment, and what is due to their assumption of themselves, and they do not.For the fight, then it becomes a reason for the conduct of Muslims.And its elevation: that they will be broken with a sickness and a weakness that will be blessed or the most of them, or their president will die and whoever praises their affairs, so he will know the believers, then that is the right of that.Their hearts, and it is obligatory to obtain patience and steadfastness, this is the words of the judge.And the answer to it from two faces: the first: that we have indicated that patience is a cross from the intention to the silence, and the steadfastness is a freedom from the silence, so this verse was made by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the verse of the sake of the servant Excellency, and that is to your words, and you are speaking about his appearance and carrying it on the causes of patience and the stability of feet, and I know that there is no way.(P-159) The second face: In the answer that these reasons that you have greeted are with the verb of God, if they are obtained and found, then there is no effect in the ritual of the ritual It has no effect in which it was not a pleasant one, and if it had an effect on the hypothesis, then this is the source The argument of the two righteousness is the one who is the most desperate, so it is obligatory to obtain the correct parting, because it is not necessary for the two disputes, which is the one who is required.
