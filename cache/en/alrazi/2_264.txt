The researcher is the transcendent: a well -known saying and forgiveness is better than a charity that is followed by harm, and God is a sweet rich, O you who believe, do not invalidate you His money is the seam of the people and does not believe in God and the last day, so he likened him to the same as the grace of dust, so he wounded him and leaving him, and he is not a slander, and he is not able to do.The unbelieving people guide and the example of those who spend their money to abide by the pleasure of God and fix from themselves as the paradise of the garden Two weakness, if it does not become a thickness, and God is what you do with vision.As for the well -known saying, it is the saying that the hearts accept and do not deny it, and what is meant by it is that the questioner responds with a beautiful way of good, and he said: The forgiveness is in his faces: one of them: that the poor, if it is returned, without his intention, it is a hardship for it, so that it may be done on that of the tongue, then it is the same Fakr and forgiveness for his abuse.And the second: that the intention and the milestone of God be forgiven by God, due to the beautiful response.And the third of it: that what is meant is from the forgiveness is that the need of the poor will not be lost, and it will not be lost, and it is intended from the known saying of his response with the best of the good, and the best of the ritual He will be reminded that he reminds him of the one who hates the poor and his shelves in his condition.And its booster: that his saying: a well -known saying with the questioner that the questioner responds with the best of the methods, and his saying: and forgiveness is a discourse with a rhetoric with the rhetoric of The questioner in that response, maybe when this thing is not able to do so in that state, then he explained that the action of the man is for this one of the two of the two of him And because of this prejudice that if it is given, then the giving is followed by abuse, then there is a group between the rush and the harm, and perhaps the reward of the ritual is not fulfilled, and the reward is the same, but the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one A rush from where it includes the delivery of the secret to the heart of the Muslim, and the harm did not come to him, so this was better than the first.(P-44) Know that one of the people who said: The verse is a response in the voluntary; Because the duty is not permissible to prevent it, nor the response of the questioner from it, and it may be inevitable that the duty is intended, and it may change it from a question to the liquid and the poor to the poor.* * * Then he said: And God is rich in the charity of worshipers, so he commanded you to give you a dream for it, as it was not hurried with the punishment of the one who is a good thing From him and return to him.Then it is the Almighty and described these two types of spending; One of them: which is followed by Germany and harm.The second: which is not followed by Germany and harm, so he explained the state of each one of them, and he crushed a proverb for each one of them.He said in the first section, which is followed by Germany and harm: Oh, oh Those who believe, do not invalidate your charity with whom and harm, such as whose money is spent, the people of the people, and do not believe in God and the last day, and in the verse of the questions: It is forbidden for the charity to the one who is harmful to the one who is likely to be injustly, that it is intended that what is meant is that the one and the harm is the throat of the charity, and the one who is known is that It was presented, so it is not correct to be invalidated, so what is meant is the heroes of its reward and its rewards; Because the reward did not get after, and it is accepted, and it is correct for its heroes with what comes from the time and harm.And know that it is the highest of the custody of the fee of the charity in the one who is an ideal, so he represented it first with those whose money is spent, the head of the people, and it is not the same The last; Because it is the reward for the agreement of this disbeliever, it appears from the heroes of the charity of those who followed by the ones and the harm, and then he represented it secondly with the grace of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The strong rain hit him, and that dust will remove from him until he becomes as if he had no dust and no dust in origin, so the infidel is like gravity, and dust is like that The work of the infidels is liked, and as the one and the harm that the work of this is the manner.The reward for spending after its obtaining, and that is clear in the saying of frustration and atonement.Al -Jubai said: And this text is indicated by the validity of our saying, the mind is also indicated by it, and that is because whoever obeyed and disobeys, if he deserved the reward of his obedience and the reward of his obedience The two must have to be entitled to the two; Because the condition of the reward is that it is permanent, permanent, in the past, and the condition of the punishment is that it is a permanent, pure, and permanent, and it is not permanent, and it is not possible.The frustration is to obtain the investigation of the two inconsistencies and that is referred, and because when he is punished, he has prevented him from rewarding, and preventing reward is injustice, and this is the punishment, and this is the punishment, and this is the punishment, and this is the punishment, and this is the punishment, and this is the punishment.Punishment is just from where it is his right, and that it is an injustice from where it is forbidden In frustration and atonement for this text and the mind of the mind, this is the words of the disgrace.As for our companions, they said: It is not intended to say it: Do not invalidate the prohibition on removing this reward after its evidence, but what is meant by it is that it comes to it.He intended it to be the same as the face of God, and he came to him from the appetite on the heroic, and our companions took our companions on the heroes of the saying of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And the emergency if there is no contradiction between them, there was no necessity of the emergence (P-45) It was obtained between them, and the rush of the emergency was more than the demise of the navigate, but perhaps this was the first because the payment is easier than raising.Second: that the emergency, if he was overwhelmed, was either he was invalidated by what he entered into the presence in the past and it is referred; Because the past was passed and did not stay immediately, and the hostility of the mantle is referred, or that it is invalidated by what is existing at the time, which is also referred; Because the existing immediately if it was the same at the time, the gathering was required between the numbers and the supplies, and it is referred, or that it will be invalidated in the future and it is referred; Because the one who will be found in the future is immediately, and the hostility of what was not after a referred.And the third of it: that the condition of the emergence of the emergence of the navigate, and if we made the removal of the navigate, thoroughly with the emergency of the emergency of the emergence of the role, it is referred.And he pushed it: that if the emergence is the precedent, the precedent reward is either as long as this is a thing of something or does not integrate anything from it That is because the obligatory for each one of them is the presence of the other, so if the two of the people would have obtained with those who are up to the two of them, the two of the two of the two are required, the two of the two of the two of the two of the two It is necessary for each one of them to be equipped as if each one of them is a mantle while it is referred.As for the second, which is the saying of Abi Ali Al -Jubai; It is also invalid because the emergency punishment is when the precedent reward is removed, and that preceding reward has no effect on the removal of the thing from this punishment, not the one who is not.He has the work that has been rewarded in the first place, in the first place, not in the reward of reward, nor in the payment of punishment, and that is against the anti -text that is permissible in the saying of his saying: Fare to see it [Zallah: 7] and because it is the disagreement of justice, where the servant carries the hardship of obedience, and he did not appear from it from it, neither in the righteousness of the benefit or in the heart.Fifth: It is that you say: the young man loves some parts of the reward without some, and that is referred to the saying; Because the parts of the investigations are equal in what is, then the young, if the effects of which are disturbed to some of these investigations without some with the sake of all the sake of the sake of all, in the same way That is a prejudice to the possible one who is not likely to be referred, and it is not possible except that it is said that the young, the emergency, removes all of that of the incident Related.And its sixth: that the punishment for the great if it is more than the reward for the advanced action, then it is said that the influencer in the heights of the reward is some of the parts of the punishment, or the one who is the one who is the punishment, and the one who is the one who is the punishment, and the one who is the one who is the punishment for the punishment, Sitting some of those parts with the influence without some with all the leveling of all in the waters of the place of the place that is possible, unanimously, and it is referred, and the division, and the division, and the division, and the division, Because it is then that the one part of the reward collects two parts of the punishment with the punishment that each one is part of the part of the reward, so that the reward is in the past On one effect, it is impossible to be transmitted, and that is refined; Because it takes advantage of each one of them, and it is a richness of them with the state of his being, in need of them, with it while he is referred.And the sake of it: It is that there is no contradiction between these two investigations; Because the master, if he says to his servant: keep the belongings so that he will not be poured into it (P-46) the shed, then in that time the enemy came and the intent of killing the master, and the slave of That enemy and killing him, for that act from the servant, he must be able to make him praise and exalted Where he presented his money to theft, and every one of the two investigations is fixed, and the minds are in the same way as this occurrence to the hypothesis, or to the end of the With the escape of one of the two investigators and its demise, then this is a burden in the atmosphere of the minds.And the eighth: that the obligatory to obtain this investigator is the advanced action, for this emergency is either that he has an effect on the side of that, that is the verb of that the verb of this verb, not for that of the verb of that It is, and the first is referred to that this is the verb, but it will be in the past time.It is referred, and if the emergency does not have an effect on the extent of that the previous action of that investigator, that is necessary as it is as it is and that it does not go away.It is not said that it is not permissible for this emergency to be a prohibition from the appearance of the effect on that precedent; Because we say: If this emergency is not able to do the point of that, the preceding act is inherent in the first place and the bit of the rhythm of the past in the past, It is possible in the sentence, the past was on this estimation stronger than this juvenile, so the past was the payment of this juvenile, the first of the opposite.And the ninth: that these disgraceful ones say: The drinking of a daring of wine loves the reward of faith and obedience to seventy years on the path of salvation, and that is referred; Because we know with the harm that the reward of this obedience is more than the punishment of this single disobedience, and the greatest is not surrounded by the least.The single one is greater than every obedience; Because the disobedience of God glorifies the amount of his blessing and his goodness, as the right of the Rabbaniyyah and his Lord, his king, and his king, and his reaches to the sake His right to his right to the many blessings, then if the blessings of God be upon His servants, where you are not bound by greatness and a lot, it is not forbidden to be able to do the one.The great that It is fulfilled by the reward of obedience.Know that this excuse is weak; Because the king, if his blessings be upon his servant, then then that servant has the right of his servants to five years, then he broke the head The king loses all his obedience to that destiny of the generosity, so every one is vilified and attributed to it to the leaving of fairness and cruelty, and knowing that all of the sins are to all of the sins.The highness is less than the breaking of the head of the pen, so it appeared that what they said on the dispute of the measurement of the minds.And I see it: The faith of an hour guides the disbelief of seventy years, for faith is seventy years, how is it guided by the immorality of an hour?!This is what the mind does not accept, and God knows.This is the course of the mental indicative of the corruption of the despair in the toughest of this verse of this verse, so we say: the saying of it: You are invalidated by your charity with whom and harm is tolerated by two: It was found in vain, and this interpretation does not harm us.The second face: that the one who is intended to be involved is to be brought to it on the face of the reward, then after that if it is followed by the one who is followed by the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment for the one who is the punishment of the one who is the punishment for the one who is followed Checking, and on this direction, they will be taken away from the verse, so why was the loyalty of the memorial on this second direction, the first one who carried it on the first one?He knew that God is the highest of that two ideals: one of them is the first condemnation, and it is his saying: as the one whose money spends the head of the people and does not believe in the one who does not believe.That what is meant is from his work, this is void, that he entered the existing existence, not that he entered correctly, and then goes down; Because the objection is from the validity of this deed is the disbelief, and the disbelief is compared to it, so its entry is forbidden to be valid in the provision, so this example is witnessed by what we have gone to The second proverb, which is the graphic that was dust and dust, then it was afflicted with it, so this is witnessed to their interpretation; Because he is the Almighty, he made the wadpical a removal for that dust after the dust falls into the ranks, so this is how we must be the one who is a wage for the reward for the reward The reward is, except that we say: We do not surrender that the likeness of the dust on the graphics is the reward of the reward for the disbelievers, but the likeness of this is the source They are counted with the corrupt intention, which was obligated to collect the reward and reward, for the likeness of the dust that falls on the ranks is that deed that is emerging from it, and the word of the words of it; Because the dust, if it is located on the grains, was not attached to it and is not a disgraced in it, but that communication was like separation, so it is In the eyes of the eye, it is connected, and in the truth, it is not connected, so the spending that is counted by the one and the harm, it is seen in the phenomenon that it is a work of righteousness, and in the truth, it is not like that Bring them a weak verse.As for the mental argument that they have been holding, it is clear that there is no contradiction in the collection between the two investigations, and that that is required of that gathering, either.The second question: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: Do not invalidate your charity with those who are on God, because of your truth And harm to the poor.Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said; Because if a person spends it, it is likely to do it, and he would not have the kindness of the inclination and the deduction to God and the confession that that is from his virtue and his success God Almighty, even if the second saying appeared to him.* * * As for his saying: Like the one whose money is spent, the people of the people are spent in his two issues: the first question: the sufficient in his saying: as in which he says: the first: the first: the first: the first: the first: the first: And appreciation does not invalidate your charity with whom and harm, such as the heights of whose money spends the people of the people, so that the Almighty indicated that the sin and the harm are thick, as the hypocrisy, as the hypocris And the saying is achieved in which the hypocrisy and the consequences come to the charity, not to God Almighty, and whoever associates the charity with the one who has come to the truth Also, if his abuse was from that charity, the pleasure of God Almighty for those who are on the poor and not hurt him, then the two pictures of the two pictures have proven in the way of the one who is the same God is exalted, and this achieves what we have said that the intended of the abuse that comes to him is void, not that the intended one is correct, then remove it and its absence.And the second saying: that the kaf is in the place of the monument in the case, that is, do not invalidate your charity as the same as those whose money spends the people of the people.The second question: the life is a source, like the prosecution: it is angry with a ray and a pride, such as: his patronage and sponsors, and it is that you see your work, and the words of you, It was presented, then it is the Almighty when he mentioned this example, followed him with the second example, so he said: He is like him and in this guerrilla and Jahan: one of them is that he is the one.God, the exalted, likened to the hypocrisy, then the argument likened to the stone, and then he said: Like the two grades, which is the stones, the smoothness, and the righteous of the sake, One, and all of that is short, and some of them said: Al-Safwan is a collection (P-48) Safwanah, such as Marjan and Merjanah, Sa`dan and Sa`danah, then he said: So he wounded him, and he said: And the sky walked Tallal and by all, and the land is a molile, that is, it was afflicted with it, then he said: So he left it with the slander of the slave, the dress of Japan, it is said: a stone and a mountain, if it is a ritual ritual That is, I do not give up anything like the wilderness, and the tin is born if it does not turn a fire.He knew that this is the example of God Almighty for the work of the harmful Germans, and the work of the hypocrisy, for people see in the shadow that these are the same, as is the dust of this If the day of resurrection is all of it, all of it is invalidated; Because it was found that those places would not have been for God, as the wad was gone, what was on the ranks of the soil, and the disgraced, and they said: The meaning is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good Then, the sin and harm removed that reward, as it removes the dust from the face of the grace.And know that in this way of this simile and two sides: the first: What we mentioned is that the phenomenon work is like dust, the van, the harmful and the hypocris The saying of the disgraceful, because the one and the harm is like a gate.The second face in the likeness, the lock - may God have mercy on him - said: There is another introduction in it, which is that the worship of worshipers is a huge for them the day of resurrection.A atom in the land, so it is expelled for him and grows until he harvested him in his time, and he finds it the time of his need, and the gravity is the place of the attempt, and there is no one who does not grow There is an acceptance for the seeds, and the meaning is that the work of the man, the harmful and the hypocrisy, is similar to it if it is given a seed in the ranks A seller, his atom is empty in which there is nothing in it.As he has instilled two bonds in the Lord of the earth, he reaps the fruit of his heads in the wages of the need while she is eating every time with the permission of her Lord, who is doubled, and the work of the And the opposite, as it is a seed in the grades that are dust, so that the need for the plant is not found in it.And from the length of those who stabbed in the likeness, he said: If the rows are afflicted, he will make it pure, clean, clean about dust and dust, so how is it permissible?.The answer is that the similarity face is what we mentioned, so it is not considered to be taken into account as it is behind it.Al -Qadi said: And a white, so the soil falls on the graphics, it benefits the benefits of its faces: one of them: that it is reconciled in the stability of it.And the second: the integrity of it in the completion.And the third: the integrity with it, while it connects with the bullets.This is the face that the judge mentioned is good, except that the accommodation over the first.As for the saying of the Almighty: they do not appreciate anything from what they have earned, know that the guerrilla is in his saying: No They appreciate what is it back?In it, they say: One of them is that he is a teacher to a well -known knowledge, that is: no one of the creation is unable to that seed that is glorified in that dirt that was the one who was the soil that was the one who was the dust of that Because that dust was removed and that was what was in it, and no one remains for the benefit of that seed, and this strengthens the second face in the second.May God have mercy on him - as well as the man, the harmful and the hypocritical, no one of them exceeds his work on the Day of Resurrection.The second: that he is domesticated to his saying: such as whose money spends and removed this meaning; Because his saying: as he spends his money, he is referred to him to gender, and gender is in the judgment of the public.Al -Qaflal -may God have mercy on him -said: It is a third aspect, which is that this is a new person on his saying: (No) (P -49), you are invalidated by the truth of you and the harm, then if you do so, then you will do so.You are able to do anything from what you have gained, so return from the speech to the absent, as the Almighty saying: even if you are in the ark and run with them [22].Then he said [Tala'al]: And God does not guide the infidels and its saying on their saying: the depression of faith, and on the saying of the dismay: it is the Almighty, who will deliver them from the reward.Their choice.* * * Then the Almighty said: And the example of those who spend their money to abide by the pleasures of God and fix them from themselves as a paradise with a rabbit that has been afflicted with it If it does not become a throat and God, and God is what you do.Know that God is exalted when he mentioned the same hypocrisy that is the one who is harmful to the same as the speaker who is not like that, and it is this one, and it is this These spending from this spending are two things: one of them: the request of the pleasure of God is the Almighty, and the abusing is an abuse from the absence of any request, and whether I said: The second syntax: it is the same as the soul, in which there are faces: one of them: that they seek themselves on the memorization of this obedience and leave what it spoils, Whoever and harm, and this is the saying of the judge.And the second: and it is proven from themselves with the believers that it is true to faith in it, and it is assumed by the readers of a jurist.And the third of it: that the soul has no steadfastness in the standing of the servants, unless it becomes a maximum in the direction, and its lover is two things: the life of urgent and the money, then if it is done, then the money is done.It has become a maximum of some faces, and if it is assigned to the soul of the soul, it has become a mortgage of some of the face “From“ who is to be overflowing, and the meaning is that those who have made his money to God, then you have proven some of his soul His saying: And you are in the way of God In your mother and yourself [Al -Saf: 11] This face was mentioned by the owner of the scout, and it is good words and a pleasant interpretation.And the one who has been paid, and he who was in the port of this place, is the time of this position: that the stability of the heart does not get except with the remembrance of God, according to what he said: except with the remembrance of God: His money was spent in the path of God, and the reassurance of the heart did not obtain the heart in the place of the manifestation, unless his spending is to be present to the servants of the servants, and this is the one who is the one God is from him that he said in his spending: We are your feed for the face of God.It is only permissible to abide by the face of his Lord, the highest, and to satisfy [the night: 19, 20, 21].He reassured his heart, and his soul was stable, and he did not get his soul with his heart, and for this he said first in this spending, it is for the sake of God.By saying it: I was stressed from themselves.Fifth: that it has been established in the mental sciences, that the reaction of the verbs is due to the fact that the links are established.If you know this, then say: Whoever continues to spend once after another, to seek the pleasure of the pleasure of God, he obtained for him from that perseverance: one of them: one of them.The second: The goodness of this abuse and the request is a stable kingdom in the breath, until the heart becomes in terms of if it was issued for it, a verb on the authority The heart is immediately to the Jerusalem of Jerusalem, and that is because that worship has become like usual and creation for the soul, so the servant comes with obedience to God, and for the abuse of God The stable kingdom, which was expressed in the Qur’an with the same as the soul, and it is also what is meant by (P-50) with its saying: The God is proven and the one who is safe The installation of the spirit in this world from the jewelry of the spiritual angels and the sacrifices of the sacrifices, so the servant became as it was said by some of the investigators, who are absent.And its sixth: Al -Zajaj said: What is meant from the confirmation is that they spend it associate that God is transcendent and does not waste their work, and does not disappoint their hope; Because it is a course of reward, punishment and emerging with the difference of the hypocrite, then if the time of that spending is lost; Because it is not believed in reward, this is the prevailing is intended.And its sake: Al -Hassan, Mujahid, and Giving said: What is meant is that the hypocrite is proven to give charity, and he puts it in the people of the righteousness and the chastity, the good said: If God was given, and if his uncle is your touch, the one said: Rather, it is permissible for me to be proven in the sense of the installation; Because they have established themselves in the request of the deserved Money in his face.Then it is up after that he explained that their excess of spending these two things was beaten to spend for example.Asim and Ibn Amir read “with a rabua” with the opening of the Arabs, and in the believers “to a Lord” and it is a language of Tamim, and those who remain in the light of the Arabs are in them, and it is the most famous of the language, and the most famous of the language Languages ​​of “Lord” with the punishment of the three movements over the Arabs, “Rabawa” by thousands by punishing the three movements on the Arabs, and “Rabu”.And the interesting pioneer, the fearful said: The one who chooses it “the Lord” by the guarantee; Because it is the whole of the Lord, and the origin of it from their saying: the Lord of the thing is raised if it increases and increases, and from the rappee; Because the parts of it were raised, and from the Lord, if it suffers from a soul in his wandering, it is more than the usury, because it takes the leadership.And know that the interpreters said: The two gossip, if it was in the Lord of the earth, was better and more intense.I have a forms in it: that if the two dresses are in a rush from the earth, it was above the water and did not benefit from it, and the winds are harmed by many The waters of the rivers set up, and the winds of the winds are not established, so it is not good for it, so the ears of the two gossip is that it is good if it is on the ground, not A Lord or a gift, then it is not what is meant by this Lord, what they mentioned, but what is meant by him is the land of the land is free, in terms of if it comes down, and it is the one who has come to the rain, The earth when it was on this adjective is the most of it, and the trees are completed in it.This is the interpretation that I mentioned is confirmed by two ways: one of them: the saying of the Almighty: and the earth sees an important, then if we have the water, the water is removed from the Her Lord, what we mentioned, so we are.The second: It is the same as the example of this example in the first place of the first, and then the first ideal was the descriptions in which the rain does not affect the rain, and it is not raised, nor does it grow It was for him, so what was meant by rabies was in this example, as the land is the land where they were raised and growing, so this is what was dangerous for the Babal and God, he knew his predecessor.* * * Then he said: He was afflicted with her and a fool, so she eaten her twice and in which there are questions: The first question is: a son of many and a beneficiary read and Abu Amr.With the inability, which is the basic, and the food is food, because it is that it is eaten.Eating in the sense is the same as food, and the luxury sought: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ He has a luck of this world.The second question: Al -Zajaj said: So she eaten her Two weakness means two likes; Because the weakness of the thing is the same as an increase in it, and the weakness of the thing was said to be the same, a bid said: I was pregnant in a year of the drain, what is the one who carries it in the way, and he said: It will be in its other hand, and Abu Muslim said: Likewise, he was martyred from it.* * * Then he said: “If he did not become a length, the length of the length is a small rain.It is a rain without al -Wabel, except that its fruit remains in its case on the two estimates, it does not decrease due to the decrease in the rain, and that is due to the generosity of the Nabat.The second: the meaning of the verse if it does not become a stirring until it is doubled its fruit, so it is imperative that it befall it a length that gives a fruit without the fruit Being, as well as those who have been given a charity for God Almighty, who is not lost as a little or a lot.* * * Then he said: And God is what you do with vision and what is meant by the knowledgeable vision, that is, it is the highest scholar of the height of the executions and their in the matter, and the mission of the mission, and the mission of it, Fakhr, and evil is evil.
