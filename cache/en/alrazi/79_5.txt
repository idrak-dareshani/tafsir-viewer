الباحث القرآني(p-26)(سُورَةُ النّازِعاتِ) (وهي أرْبَعُونَ وسِتُّ آياتٍ مَكِّيَّةٌ) ﷽ والنّازِعاتِ غَرْقًا والنّاشِطاتِ نَشْطًا والسّابِحاتِ سَبْحًا فالسّابِقاتِ سَبْقًا فالمُدَبِّراتِ أمْرًا (بِسْمِ اللَّهِ Merciful) and the disputes are placed, and the stimulants are active, and the sacrifices are praise.It is entitled to be the characteristics of one thing, and it is not possible that they are not like that, but for the first involvement, they have mentioned in the verse, and it is: (one of them).The angels, and his saying: The disputes are the places that are the angels who dismiss the souls of the children They say: We are removed in the sitting, and it is placed, it is said: The dispute is placed in the sitting if it reaches the end of the range until it ends up to the text, so the ritual of the ritual: And the place in the language in one means, and its saying: and the stimulants active is the attraction, it is said: I activate the evidence that I activate and active it, and I have been active, and it was active.The angels that activate the spirit of the believer, and they will be seized, but we have allocated this to the believer and the first with the infidels, because of the tears and the activity, then the virginity, then the virginity, then the virginity, and the acting of the part, The activity is attracted with horizons and softness.The one who has said that his saying: and the disputes are divorced and the intercourse is active in dividing the king of death and his aides, except that the first is a sign of an entity of the arms of the infidels.The second is a sign of the entirety of the arrest of the believers, but his saying: and the sacrifices are praise, for those who allocated it, too, to the angels of the sake of the signs of the people, and from them, and from them, and from them, and from them, and from them.The angels.As for (the first face), it was transferred from the peace be upon him, and Ibn Abbas, and Mesareuq, that the angels ask the souls of the believers, the one who is a man, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said And the intercourse is active and then leaves it until it is removed from a ray, and then they will come out after that with a jungle and a roll like the one who prays in the water, so it is a slave in the water.And for the circumambulation, lest it be overwhelmed, so this is what they are accompanied by that (P-27), the absurdity, so that there is no pain and intensity to him, so that is what is meant by his saying: Those who carried it on the wandering of the angels, and they said: The angels descend from the sky are wasting, so make their descent from the sky like the swimming The horse is the swimmer, and as for his saying: the precedents are preceded, so those who made it pleased with the angels of the arrest of the signs, they precede the people of the infidels, and to the people of the people And among them is those who interpreted it with the pads of the angels, then they mentioned this precedent and faces: (one of them) said Mujahid and Abu Rawq: The angels are the same With faith and obedience, and there is no doubt that the stigmatization in the good is a great degree.(And the second) Al -Farah and Al -Zajaj said: The angels precede the demons with the revelation to the prophets; Because the two devils were selected.(And thirdly) It is inevitable that what is meant is that he is exalted and described them, so he said: They do not precede him by saying [the Prophet: 27] means before the authorization, he does not leave it and does not For God Almighty, and fear of his hippo, and here we have described them as before, if the matter comes to them, then they will hurry to his compliance, and they will come to him, and they will come to him.His saying: The precedents are before, and as for his saying: The mobilizers are an order, so they gathered on the fact that they are the angels: a fighter said: It means Jabril, Mikhail, and Mikhail.Peace be upon them, the command of God, the Exalted in the people of the earth, and they are divided by an order.The death is entrusted with the grocery of the same, and as for the sarfil, it is descended from the matter of them, and the people of them are entrusted with the memorization of the children of Adam, Other people with misery, mugs, wind, clouds and rain.The remainder of the two questions: The first question: Why did he say: (The municipalities are an order), and he did not say: things, they are planning many things, not one thing?(And the answer) is that what is meant by the spectrum, and if it is the same as the place of the group.The second question: The Almighty said: The whole thing is for God, so how do you prove to them here, the matter of the matter?(And the answer) When that came to him, it was the matter as if it is for him, so this is the disagreement of what the interpreters said in this section, and I have it (another face) which is that the angels are the same وصِفاتٌ إضافِيَّةٌ, أمّا الصِّفاتُ السَّلْبِيَّةُ فَهي أنَّها مُبَرَّأةٌ عَنِ الشَّهْوَةِ والغَضَبِ والأخْلاقِ الذَّمِيمَةِ والمَوْتِ والهِرَمِ والسَّقَمِ والتَّرْكِيبِ مِنَ الأعْضاءِ والأخْلاطِ والأرْكانِ, بَلْ هي جَواهِرُ Spiritualism is broken from this case, so he said it: and the disputes are divorced, indicating that it is, which is removed from these conditions, and this is a whole from all of the wives The interpretation (disputes) is the self -conflict as the son and the tamrums, and the saying of it: and the stimulants are active indicating that its exit from these conditions is not the same As in the right of humanity, they are in the way that they are satisfied with these conditions, and they are removed from these conditions, and they were removed from these attributes, so the two words are two signs of the righteousness of the As for their additional attributes, they are a sect: (one of them), the evil of their strong strength, that is, how are their condition in the knowledge of the King of God and his king In this place with two descriptions: (one of them) said: And the sacrifices are praise, so they praise the first of their innocence in the sailors of the majesty of God, then it is not over to their pursuit; Because there is no end to the greatness of God and the highest of his silence and the light of his majesty and his arrogance, so he never understood in that swimmer.(And secondly) his saying: (P-28), the precedents are preceded, and it is a sign of the angels in that permissibility, as it is as the dirats of the knowledge of the bachelors to the lineage of the nap Boshans is deficient, and the dilation of human knowledge with the lineage to the paths of the acquaintances of the angels is incomplete, as well as the knowledge of some of the angels with the best of the wives to the same The rest is varying, and that the violation between the types of Persians and the type of man in the name is not with the symptoms, as well as the violation between each person from one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the people of one of the one from the one who is one of the one of the one of the one of the people The other is in the way, if it was different from the way, not by the symptoms, it was not a favorable condition in the grades of the knowledge, and in the paths of the man His saying: The precedents are before, so the two words are intended from them.* * * As for his saying: the municipalities are an order, it is a sign of the explanation of the state of their strength, and that is because every case of the lower world is delegated to the one who is one of the two Those who are the Ammar of the high world and the population of the heavens, and when the mob The worker who has them, this is a phenomenon that was mentioned by God, and God knows his prestige of his words.And he knew that Abu Muslim bin Bin Bahar Al -Asfahi was stabbed in the pregnancy of these words on the angels.On the basis of al -Tawniyyah, and the words of the infidels, where he said: And they made the angels who are the servants of the Most Merciful.[Al -Zakarf: 19].Know that this is a stab that does not turn to our interpretation; Because the intended things are the ones of the conflict, and this destiny does not require what is mentioned of the ritual.The second face in the interpretation of these words: it is the stars, and it is the saying of the Basriyah of goodness, and the description of the stars with the disputes, and the face of it: The earth is attracted to what is above the earth, then if it is a tendency, it is the same as a tendency, and it is true that it is said that it is a dispute over the meas of the son and the tamarot.(And the second) that the disputes are from their saying that we are removed to him, that is, the gold of the dispute, so this was said by Al -Kahidi, as if they were informed and strangers with conflict and righteousness.(And the third) is that that is from their saying: I was removed from the horses if it is running, so it is: (and the disputes), meaning and the neighborhoods on the power of the destiny, and the one who is the one who is the one who said: And two sides: (one of them) to be a state Confusion and will, and it is a sign of the same condition in that will, if it was said: If the orbits and the fries are not spoken, the meaning of it is what it means and described it with that?Say: This is on the way to the likeness, as the Almighty saying: Everyone is in the right to praise [Yass: 40].On the way to the likeness.(And the second) that the meaning of its west is its absence in the horizon of the west, the fought is a sign of its outlook, and (a divine) is a sign of its stranger, that is, it is removed from it, then it is removed, then it is placed, then it is placed, then the place is placed.It was mentioned by the people of the interpreters.As for his saying: and the stimulants are active, the owner of the scout said: It is meaning that it comes out from a tower to a tower from your saying: a active revolution if it comes out from a country.And I say: The hall of these words is returned until its saying: and the disputes are divorced by referring to its movement of the day, and the stimulants are active by reference to its transmission from the ritual to the way, which is the ritual It is specialized in its own orientation, and it is surprising that its right-wing movements are alienated, and it moved it from a softening to a bit of no, not to be a matter, but (P-29).It was crossed by the first by the tears and the second of the activist, so he contemplated, who is the poor in these secrets.* * * As for his saying: and the sacrifices are praise, the good and Abu Ubaida - may God have mercy Because it is its mourning in the atmosphere as the praise, and for this he said: Each in an anchor who praises [Yes: 40].* * * As for his saying: the precedents are preceded, so Al -Hasan and Abu Ubaidah said: They are the stars, some of them are some of them in the path, because of the one who is a bit of the bone, Because of its return or its residence.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: the municipalities are an affairs in his face and Jahan: (one of them) that by the reason for its path and its movement, it is distinguished by some of the abuse of some, so it is the same, so it is the one who said, so it is the one who said: Exalted: (Glory be to God, when you touch, and when you become praise and praise [Al -Rum: 18,17] and he said: They ask you about the family, say it is the time of the people and the pilgrim: Let you know the number of years and the account [Yunus: 5] and because by the movement of the sun, the four chapters are different, and it is different from the disagreement of the people of the It was added to these tannings.It creates it, then after this, if we were able to make it the most influential strength in it, in the conditions of this world, then this is obeyed in the debt of the religion, and that it is not.The powers are also, but we say: God is glorified and exalted, and his habit is that he made every one of its special conditions as a reason for the extermination of this, as a matter of this Because of the sacrifice, and drinking is a reason for the irrigated, And the consequence of the fire is a reason for burning, so the saying of this gold does not harm Islam at the face of the face of the faces, and God knows the truth of the situation.The third face in the interpretation of this fifth word is that it is the most signs, and that is because the same dead is removed, it is said: so that the rushing, and so, and so is it in the way, so it is in the way.The breath is disputes at the context, and the meaning of (murder), that is, a hard disgrace that has been informed of what is and more than the dispute of the dispute in the sitting, and also active, because it is active.Then the empty human aspects of the generous, detected to the high communication after their exit from the injustice of the bodies, go to the world of the angels, The faces are in a wind and a bit, and he expressed its going on this case with permissibility, then there is no doubt that the paths of the souls in the negligence of the world and the love of the world Different, the word was in these conditions, the same way it was until there is a precedent, and whenever it was weakened, it was its path until there is heavier, and there is no doubt that the people of the righteous He is honored, so the division of the division does not fall into it, then these are the high mourning aspects that are not far from them that they will be what they are for their strength and their honor, and this is the effect of this.The mobilizers are an order that the human being may see him in the sleep and ask him about a problem, and he will guide him to her?Is not that the son may see his father in the sleeping in his guidance to a buried treasure?Was it not that Galinos said: I was a satisfactory, so I miraculously made myself, so I saw in the dream one, guided me to the Kevi of the treatment?Is it not that Al -Ghazali said: The mourning signs, if they separate their eternity, then agreed with a person similar to the first person in the spirit and body, then he does not go away from the time Considering this body until it becomes like the one who is stuck to the soul that is attached to that body on the goods of the good, so that it is called that the Mu’awadah?And its counterpart in the side of the evil souls and the politicians, and this is the suffering, even if it is not stated by the beneficiaries, except that the word (P-30) is unjust.The luxury face in the interpretation of this fifth word: that they are the attributes of the horses of the invaders, they are disputes because they are destroyed in their own meanings.Because it is Arabs, and it is a stimulus because it comes out from the house of Islam to the House of War, from their saying: a active revolution if it comes out from country to a country, and it is the sacrifices because it is a sacrifice in its Because it precedes the end, and it is the rally of the matter of dominance and the nail, and the support of the mobilization to it is metaphor; Because it is one of its causes.* * * Fifth face: It is the choice of my father, a Muslim - may God have mercy on him - that this is the attributes of the invaders, as the disputes are the hands of the invaders, it is said to Al -Rammi: We are removed in his sitting, and it is said: He was placed in the tears if it is fulfilled by the stretch of the sitting, and the arrows are the arrows, and it is the most important of it from the hands of the archers and its influence, and everything is a solution.The activity of the man, which is his simplicity and his lightness, and the siblings in this place, the horses and praise the enemy, and it is permissible to mean the camels as well, and the mourners, and the mourners, It comes in this act of this action that is the risk of arrows and the praise of the horses and the precedent of the matter that is the victory, and the appeal was noted, but it was because these are the groups, as it is the same as: It is required that what is meant is the one of the omissions and ghosts, in the sense of the disposal in it and its desired.The sixth face: that this word can be interpreted by the words that occur in the back of the heart, without God Almighty to God and the disputes are the deeds The rhetoric, or the dispossession of the love of God other than the Almighty, and the activity is active, is that it is after the return from the gestures, taking into account the sake, Glory be to him, and a complete activity and strong power.And the sacrifices are praise, and then it is after the stimulant, it is worsened in the king of rocks, so it is cut off in that seas, so he praised it.The precedents have preceded the reference to the recession of their paths to God Almighty.The mandarians are a sign that the last of the heads of the human being is connected to the first of the rocks of the king With the world of angels, which is what is meant by his saying: The mobilizers are an order, for the first four are what is meant by his saying: its abode is almost lighting [Al -Nur: 35].And (the fifth) is the fire in its saying: If there was no fire from it [Al -Nur: 35].And he knows that the wives, who are transmitted from the interpreters, are not stated by the Messenger of God - ﷺ - a text, so that it is not possible for it to be, but it is not the same.It is imprisoned for it, if the arrogance of the memorial is not what we mentioned, it is not without its introduction to the wives that they mentioned, it was not what they mentioned, or what we have mentioned, An accuracy, which is that the memorizer is an assigned to all, for if we are among these suffering, one concept is one of our concepts.Then, all of these faces are laid off.But if this concept is not among the destiny, it is excused for the sake of the sake of all; Because the blessed memorial is not permissible to use it to benefit his concept together, then we do not say: God's Almighty is the Almighty, but we say: As for the reward, it is not a way to it.The second indifference: It is that [no] be [this] the fifth preservation is one of the one of the one, but rather for the different things, so it is also a face: (the first) Displacement disputes are the righteous, the activity are active, the sacrifice, the sheds of the travel, the cabinets of the horses, and the angels, narrated by the son of the plain.(Al-Thani) was transferred from Mujahid in (P-31) disputes, intercourse, and sheds that they are dead, and in the preachers and ravages that they are angels, and the addition of conflict, activity, and slaughter I got it.* * * (The third) Qutda said: The whole is the stars except the mourners, so they are the angels.The second question: He mentioned the chapters of fulfillment, which was before it with wow, and in his highest and Jahan: (The first) The owner of the scout said: This is a cause of it.It was said: The one who praised themselves as they said: He rose and went, and the fulfillment was obligatory that the resurrection was a reason for the goat, and if you said: He rose up and did not make it.The one: the saying of the owner of the organizer is not mentioned in his saying: the mobilizers are an order; Because it is a reason to make the precedent a reason for the tanner, and I say: It is possible to answer the symptoms of the one - may God have mercy She was praised, and she was preceded, and she managed what she was commanded to compete with her and her prayers, so that this is a verb that connects to some of them, as well, He fell old.(Al -Thani) It is not far from being said: When they were preceded in the performance of obedience, they are hurry to it, and their safety appeared, so this is the reason, so God has delegated to them.(The second face) that the angels are the sects: the presidents and the disciples, and the evidence is upon him that he was greeting him and the Almighty said: Say: He will die of the king of the death [Al -Sajid: 11] One of you is the death of our messengers [Al -Anam: 61] So we said in the success between the two verses: The king of death is the head, and the head and the path of the Malak This is a transmission: the disputes, the intercourse, and the sample are based on the students who are shouting to work with themselves, then say it up..The municipalities are referring to the presidents who are the ones who are in the past and the honorable, and they are the ones who are armed.
