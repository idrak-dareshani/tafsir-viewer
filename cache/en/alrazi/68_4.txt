The researcher knew that he is upset when he mentioned the division by him, follow him by remembering the division of him, and he said: What you are with the grace of your Lord with a madman, and for you, for you A great creation and know that his saying: What you are with the grace of your Lord with madness in which there are two issues: the first question: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, " Ra'a, so I asked him and did not find it, so if he has a face, he was absent without dust, so I said to him: What is for you?Your Lord (Al -Alaq: 1) So it is the first of what he descended from the Qur’an, he said: Then he descended me to the decision Muhammad, so the prayer and peace be upon him for a cheek, and a cheek went to the son of Nuvil, and he is the son of her cousin, and he had been in the debt Al -Nasraniya, so I asked him and said: He sent me Muhammad, so I sent him and he came to him, and he said to him: Is it a matter of Jabril, peace be upon him?And God, when I stayed to your call, to support you, dear victory, and then died before the supplication of the Messenger, and that fell in the year of the year, so that they said: For gums, so God has divided the Almighty that he is not crazy, and it is five verses from the first of this surah.”Then Ibn Abbas said: And the first thing (The highest: 1) This verse is the second.The second question: Al -Zajaj said: (You) is the name (what) and (with a madness) the news, and its saying: the grace of your Lord is a word that is in the between and the meaning of the one who is in the sense of the meaning of you.It is said: You are the praise of God, sane, and you are the praise of God, you are not crazy, and you are the grace of God, understanding Rather, it was obtained, and the righteousness of the slander is still in the midst of God, his kindness, and his honor, and a bid and Ibn Abbas said: He wants the blessing of your Lord, For their saying: And they said, O you who was removed from him, you are the groans (the stone: 6) and know that it is up and described it with three types of characteristics.The first adjective: the denial of the madness from it, then it is the Almighty with this claim that it is like the stakeholder in its health; And that is because his saying: the grace of your Lord indicates that the blessings of God be upon him were a phenomenon in his right from the complete eloquence, the full mind, the biography, the path of the path, the brightness, and the path of the path, and the biography of And the equity is every time, and if this blessing is a sense of appearance, then its existence is contrary to the crime of madness, then God is alert alert to this The course of the Levantine connotation of their words in their saying To him: It is a madman.The second line: its saying: If you have a reward, there are no ones in the place and in those who say: One of them is: It is the saying of the largest, that the meaning is other than the one who is forbidden, not That is, he weakens it, and the weak Germans and from the thing if he cuts it, and from it is a good saying: (P-71) ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Hope: Giving is not a reunion (Hood: 108).And the second saying, which is the saying of a Mujahid, a fight, and the dog: It is unable to you with the reason for the good, the disgraceful said in the report of this face: Because it is the reward that you have to do with your work, and it is preferable to prefer, and the first saying is more like; Because he described it as a reward that benefits that there is no from it in it, then the bearer of this direction is like a repeat, then they disagreed that this reward is on anything?A people said: It is with it that you have this stabbing and the ugly saying is a great reward, and others said: What is meant is that you are in the appearance of the prophecy and the slander of the The leg of the law is for them, this is the permanent, pure reward, so do not prevent you from you to the madness of the madness of the greatness God.The third adjective: His Excellency said: You are a great creation and in which Issues are: And a definition of those who threw it with the madness that that is a lie and a mistake; That is because the eagle is the praise and the satisfactory acts of it, and whoever was described by that ethical and acts was not permissible to add the madness to it; Because the ethics of the two crowns is bad, and when the creator of Hamidah was complete, it is not a crime and God described it as great; And for this he said: Say what I ask you for a reward and what I am in charge (p.86), that is, I am not responsible for what appears to you from my morals; Because the cost of the agent does not sleep long, but he returns to the pride, and others said: He described his creation as a great; And that is because he was exalted.That is a consequence, and it is not long for the Messenger, and it is not the biology; Because his project is a violation of their partners, so he is aware that what is meant by his command is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.From the generous creation, as if each one of them was a single navigation, when he was commanded by Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, that he would not be killed, as if he was a matter of what he was.A separation of them, and when it was a high degree, it was not easy for anyone The prophet before it, there is no crime, and God has described it as a great, and there is another precision, and it is his saying: for a great creation and the word of Ali, for the sake He is accustomed to this ethical and is on the authority of it, and that it is on the basis of this beautiful ethical, such as the Mawlid by the lineage, to the servant, and the one who is the same.The second question: the creation is a kingdom that makes it easier for the description with the beautiful acts.And know that the two beautiful acts are not, and the ease of the two of it is not otherwise, for the state that its adversity will obtain that ease is the creation, and the creation is in the good Sleeping, miserliness, anger, and tension in the trades, and love for people by saying and acting, and leaving the prohibitions and jerseles, and the leniency in the contracts, such as the sales of the sales, The right of those who have a lineage or was a compassion for him and obtained another truth for him.It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: It is with it: You are a great religion, and it was narrated that God Almighty said to him: To you and your nation, “Islam means me, and know that this saying is weak, and that is because the human being has two strengths, a force of view and the power of the work of the work (P-72) (P-72) (P-72) The theoretical power, and the creation goes back to the work of the operational power, so it is not possible to carry one of them on the other, and it is also possible to be answered by this question: The creation in the language is the habit, whether it was in perception or action.The second face: I have shown that the creation is the matter that is to be adapted, and the two beautiful acts are easy.For the true divine and numerous poems for the acceptance of false heads, that ease was obtained in the acceptance of the truth, so there is no Ease of creation.The third question: “Saeed bin Hicham said: I said to Aisha: I said: Yes, I said: It was the creation of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.(The believers: 1) To ten verses, "and this is a sign until its sanctity was in the way that was attracted to the world Minimum and religious happiness with the nature and the requirement of the pharaoh, O God, we have given us something from this situation.And Hesham ibn Urwah narrated from his father from Aisha, who said: ““ No one was better than the creation of the Messenger of God ﷺ, what was called by one of his companions, nor from his family, he said: For your father, “For this, the Almighty said: You are a great creation.” Anas said: “I served the Messenger of God ﷺ ten years, so what he said to me, so I did?Nor in anything that I did not do: “Do you do” and say: God Almighty has described what he returns to his theory strength that he is great, so he said: He did not know what he did.God is great (the women: 113) and described what he returns to his practical strength that he is great and he said: You are a great creation, so he did not stay for the sake The two forces are something, so the group of these two vessels reflected that his spirit is between the human sides, and it was great, as if it was like it, as if it was like it.The sweetest of the angels.And know that he was upset when he described it as a great creation, he said:
