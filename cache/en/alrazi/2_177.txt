The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: The righteousness is not to take care of your faces before the outskirts and the Moroccan The distraction of the kinship, the orphans, the poor and the son of the ways and the liquids, in the neck, and the prayer is established.Those who believed and those who are righteous.Know that in this verse there are questions: the first question: the scholars differed that this speech is general or in particular, so he said, each of them: He wanted to say that he did not say: Stability is on the face of the place of the sanctuary.And some of them said: Rather, what is meant is the addressee of the believers, when they thought that they had received the prostitution by the direction to (P-31) the Kaaba from where they would like to do so, and they would like to do so.Some of them: Rather, it is a speech for all; Because when the kiss is copied and turned it into the believer, the tribe of this kissing, and the strictness of that of the kiss is the same In the debt, God sent them to them with this discourse on the sake of all worship and obstacles, and he indicated that the righteousness is not that you are in your faces, and the savage, but the righteousness, Passion; As you do not specialize in it, as if he said it said; The righteous is not the kissing, but rather the righteous, this is the qualities that it is considered.The second question: the most of them (not) is a verb, and some of them are denied and claimed that he was burning.The Hajj of those who said that it is the verb of the connection of the conscience with which it does not communicate except with the acts as your saying: I am not, we are, and you, and the people do not say.This Hajj is exhibited with its saying: I am a loyalty and perhaps.And the argument of the denials: the first: that if it was an action, it would be past and it is not permissible to be a past action, so it is not permissible to be action.The mandate is that everyone who said that it is a verb said that it is a past verb, and that it is not permissible for it to be a past action that the congregation is on the authority of the case.To deny the past, not to deny the situation.And the second: that he enters the verb, so he says: It does not come out of Zayd, and the verb does not enter the verb in mind The story and the affair, and this sentence is an interpretation of that guerrilla; Weak, for if it is permissible for that, it is permissible in (what).And the third of it: that the letter (what) appears with its meaning, and this word is like that, so if you said: It is not more, the words are not fulfilled, but there is no, but there is no, but there is no Staying.And the one that is: that (not) if it was an action, then it was (what) is a verb and this is false, so that Infinitely, the mandate is that (not), even if it was a verb, then it was for his affairs to obtain the meaning of negatives with a special time, and this is the case.To be (what) is verb, and when this was not a verb, then the saying of that, or we remember this meaning with another dilemma, then say: (not) To exile the situation, then it (what) in the act of the actual act.Fifth: that you pray (what) with the past verbs, and you say: What is good is more, and it is not permissible to reach (what) with a do not say, so you will not say what is not increased.Sixth: It is other than the weight of the verb; Because the action is not existing in the deeds of the verb, then it was in the saying that it is a verb to prove what is not of the weight of the verb.If it was said: its origin is not like the camel of the camel, but they relieved him and the obligation to reduce; Because it is not a single condition for his young, but the sons of the verbs are different to disagree with the facts that it is indicated, and they made the building that they special in it; Because he hidden the sons.We said: This is all the disagreement of the original, and the origin is its numbers, and because the origin is in the verb, the behavior, so when they prevented him from the behavior, it was obligatory to keep him with the authority He has the imperfections, but it is made to prevent the behavior that is the disagreement of the origin in order to change the construction that is also the disagreement of the origin, so that is a very hard.And its sake: Al -Qatibi mentioned that it is a compulsive word from the forefathers: the exile who is not, and: Aas, that is, a prostitute.That is, from the numbers to the existence, and it is its founding, and this is a text in the door, he said: The caliph mentioned that (not) the word of the ingratitude of its curses: No, and the most important For the many things that take place in the words, and the evidence is upon him the saying of the Arabs: I am grateful to him from where and not, and it is meaning: from where he or he is.And eighth: the reciter indicates that the verb is placed to prove the source, and this is only the deprivation of the deprivation, so it is not a verb, for if it is said: it is said: it is said: With his saying: He denied Zida (P-32) and its number, our saying: Your saying: He denied the increased increase from the negation, and you said: The effective is a significant export, so the question was not bad.As for those who say that (not) is a verb, they have been charged with the answer to the first words that (not) may come to the past as the one who said: And on the second that it is exhibited with their saying: He took action like this.And on the third: it is exhorted by the deficient actions.And on the authority of the four: that the similar one is one of the faces, does not require the same.On the fifth: That is what was forbidden by: And about the sixth: that The construction changes, even if it is different from the original, but it gives the destiny to it the harm of the work of what we mentioned from the evidence.And on the authority of Al -Sabaa: that the Yaisiyyah is a name.So we have a variety.And on the eighth: that “is not” is derived from the lords, it is indicative of the report of the yaisi.This is what can be said in this question, even if these answer are different.The third question: Read a Hamza and a thunder of the capital “The righteousness is not“ the parking of the Arabs, and those with the lift, the one said: And both of the two readings are good; Because the name (not) and told it was gathered in the definition, so they were equal in the universe of each one of them as a name, and the other was informed.And the argument of the one who raised (the righteous) is that the name (not) is like the active, and told it to the verb, and the act is that the verb is more than the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a good one, The grammarians said: ““ With its connection, it is more important to be the name of “it is not“ its likeness to the host that it does not describe as it is not described as the one who is the same They gathered that the host was the name from where he was gone in the sealing from the appearance, and on this, he was read in the download, saying: “They were punished”: And his saying: The answer of his people was only that they said [Al -A'raf: 82] their pilgrimage was only that they said [Al -Jaathiya: 25] and the choice raised the righteousness; Because it was narrated from Ibn Masoud that he read: (The righteousness is not that) and the B is entered into the news of not.The loyal question: righteousness is a unique name for the obstacles, and the works of good approximately to God Almighty, and from this the righteousness of the two parents, the Almighty said: The righteous is in a nickname: 14] So he made righteousness against the immorality and said: And take care of righteousness and piety and do not take care of the sin and the aggression [Al -Ma’idah: 2] So he made the righteousness against the inherent, and it is a general, so it is a general, so it is a general, so it is a general.The human being, the origin of it from expansion, and the righteousness, which is the dispute of the sea for its breadth.The fifth question: Al -Qafal said: It was said in the descent of this verse of sayings, and who when we have referred to the fools who stabbed them in the Muslims and said: The one who was on it, with the fact that the Jews were accepted by the Maghrib, and the Christians were coming to the righteous, so God Almighty said: The righteousness of the righteousness does not The outlook and the western, but the righteousness only will be obtained by a group of matters: one of them: faith in God, and the people of the book are glorified by that And they said that the son of God is the son of God The Almighty, on what God has narrated that they were said about them by saying: They said that God is a poor and we are the riches of the riches [Al-Imran: 181].Faith, where they said: Paradise will not enter except for those who were a sophistication or Christians [Al -Baqarah: 111] and they said: The fire will not touch us except for numbers and the Christians, and they denied the darkening, On the other day.And the third of it: faith in the angels, and the Jews, they were deleted, as they appear to be the hostility of Jabriel, peace be upon him.And the one who has been: the belief in the books of God, the Jews and the Christians have given up with that; Because with the righteousness of the sign that the Qur’an is the book of God, they did not accept it.And you atone for some [Al -Baqarah: 85].Fifth: Faith in the prophets, and the Jews, they were subjected to that where they killed the prophets, according to what the Almighty said: And they kill the prophets with the right of the truth: ﷺ.And its sixth: the codification of the money on the authority of God, the Glory of God, and the Jews, they are glorified by that; Because they throw the youth to ask for a little money as he said: And they bought a little thues to him.And the sake of them: the establishment of prayers and zakat and the Jews, who were forbidden by people.And the eighth of it: the one who is the covenant, and the Jews we have taken the covenant where he said: And fulfill my covenant, I will fulfill your covenant.Burning, then it is ruling that the righteousness is a group of things: one of them: the prayer, and there must be in it, so the contradiction is necessary, and for the sake of this question: That his saying: The righteousness is not a negative for the fullness of the righteousness, and there is no negation of its origin, as if he said that not all righteousness is this, the righteousness is a name for the gathering of the gathering.One of them, so that the righteousness is not.The second: that this is a negation of the origin of its universe; Because they were excluded from the east and the Maghreb, it was a mistake at the time of the denial, when God transcribed the Almighty, but that was a sin and a debauchery; Because it is a work with a hook that God has forbidden, and what is like that is that it is not considered righteous.The third: that the kissing is not a righteousness if it is not compared to the knowledge of God, but rather it will be righteous if it comes with it with faith and the path of the bars, as is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the sake of the sake of faith The actions of righteousness, unless he comes with it with the faith of God and His Messenger, but if this condition is brought in it, then it is not from the actions of the righteousness, the righteousness of the righteousness, the righteousness of the righteousness, the righteousness of the There was a lot of rises in its copying, and it became as if it was not observed by the obedience of God except the ritual, so God Almighty has revealed this verse as if he said what is this is the righteousness Symptoms On all the pillars of religion.* * * The sixth question: His saying: But the righteousness is the one who believes in God in which he is deleted, and in his way of his faces: one of them: but the righteousness, but the righteousness, but the righteousness, Many in the words as his saying: and drink in their hearts the calf [Al -Baqarah: 93] that is, the love of the hurry, and they say: the presence is a hate, and the poetry is Zahir Farah, Al -Zujajj, and Qutbar, Abu Ali said: And the same is the same verse.The sake of the pilgrim is the one who believes, or you made the sake of the pilgrim like the faith of those who believe in the way of the representatives between the two source or between the two actions, as it does not happen.And the second: Abu Ubaidah said: The righteousness is in the sense of the B as it said: The punishment is for the piety [Taha: 132], meaning to those who are righteous and from it: That is, it is exaggerated, and you said: The sponsorship: ؎ It is only an adult and an adapter of any acceptance and arrangement with it.And the third of it: that it is meaning: but it is the righteousness, then they are deleted as their saying: they are grades with God, that is, the distress of grades from the gospel.And its sequence: the estimation: but the righteousness is obtained by faith, as well as from the detail.He knew that the first face is close to the words of the words, so it is its meaning: but the righteousness that is all the righteousness that leads to the great reward.And on the authority of Al -Mubdar: If I were from those who read the Qur’an with his readers, I would have read, but the righteousness, “with the opening of the B, and read the sins and the son of Amir ( By raising, and the rest, but "is a stretch of righteousness with the installation.* * * The following question: Know that God is the Almighty to fulfill the righteousness of the righteousness: the first: the faith: faith in five matters: the first: the faith of God When the knowledge is the special, and the knowledge is what is obligatory, permissible, and transmitted to it, and the science will not obtain this affairs, except for the knowledge, except for the knowledge of the knowledge There is knowledge of the world's editing, and the knowledge of the origins on which the world is separated, and he enters the knowledge of what is required of him from the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge And he is a scholar of all the information, which is valid for all the possibilities, a listening, hearing, visible, speaking, and entering into the knowledge of what is in the way of it.Cute, local, biased, and present, and enters into knowledge of what is permissible for him to destroy it for creation, creation, and mission of the messengers.And the second: faith on the last day, and this faith is separated from the first; Because we did not know that it is the highest scholar of all the information, and we did not know his ability to all possibilities that we cannot know.And publishing.And the third: faith in the angels.And its lord: believing in the books.Fifth: faith in the messengers.We are asking: the first question: There is no way for us to know the existence of the angels, nor to the knowledge with the sincerity of the books, except by the righteousness The knowledge of the angels and the books, so the angels and the books are presented in the remembrance of the messengers?.The answer: that the matter, even if you mentioned it in our minds and thoughts, except that the formation of the existence on the opposite of that; Because the king is found first, then he gets a mediation that is to be used by the books.The formation of the elderly adornment.The second question: Why is faith in this fifth matters?Answer: Because he entered it all that is required to believe in it, then he entered under the faith in God: I know him with his time The last day: the knowledge of the provisions of reward, punishment, and repetition, to the path of what is connected to that, and entered under the angels, what is connected to the performance of the rituals.To lead it to us, other than that, which must be known from the conditions of the angels, and he entered under the Qur’an, and all of what God has revealed to the Prophet With their prophecy, and their validity, they have proven that nothing remains of what is required of him to believe in it, except that he entered into this verse.Another report: It is that the cost has a principle, medium and end, and the knowledge of the principle and the end is the one who is intended with the same (P-35), which is the intention of the faith As for the knowledge of the basis of the mediator, it is only fulfilled by the abandonment, and it does not fulfill only three matters: the angels who come to the revelation, and the soul of that is the one who is the one who is the one who is The Messenger.The third question: Why is this faith provided for the actions of the wounds, which is the payment of money, prayer, and zakat.The answer: To be an alert that the hearts of the hearts are honored by God from the places of the wounds.* * * The second thing of the matters that are considered to be fulfilled by the name of the righteousness, saying: The righteousness is not to be assumed in it in the issues: the first question: they are the one who said: Loving what he returns?And they mentioned it in it: Shout, the richness of the wealth, and the fear of poverty, and you will not be aware of even if the richness is notified, you said: Luqlal like this and so, and so, and this is the state of the righteousness that the righteousness is the same From it when the distress is from the death, and the mind is indicated by that as well as it is one of the face Money, and when the death of the death thinks that the exploitation of the money is the thought of the money, and the humiliation of the thing at the need to need it to the obedience of the obedience from the abuse of it from the one who said: You will not get righteous until you spend what you love [Al -Imran: 92].And the second: that giving him the state of health indicates that it is a certainty and is the promise of the return from giving it the condition of the disease and death.And the third: that giving him the state of health is more difficult, so it is more rewarding, measurement on the poor of the fierceness, for it increases its reward for what the ritual is over.And he paid it: that whoever has his money on the honor of the disappearance, then he gave him from one of the knowledge that if he did not give him a lost, then this gift will not be from it.The loss of money, then he gave him a lump and righteous, so we are so.Fifthly: He is the same as the Almighty saying: You will not obtain righteousness until you spend what you love and say it: and they will feed the food on the food of the love of the person.Abi Al -Darada that ﷺ said: “The example of the one who believes at the death is the same as the one who guides after a hundred.” The second saying: that the guilt goes back to giving as if it was said: it is given and the giving loves a desire for the reward of God.The third saying: that the guerrilla is a good at the name of God Almighty, meaning they give money to the love of God, that is, to seek his illness.The second question: They disagreed with the intended of this orphans, and a people said: It is zakat, and this is weak; And that is because it was the highest of the zakat on him by saying: He established the prayer and the zakat came and the right of the converted and the most kind to it is that it is a matter It does not leave either it is from the vigils or from the obligations, it is not permissible to be of proprieties; Because he said at the end of the verse: Those who believed and those who are righteous and stood up to him, and if this was a scar, he would not have been.Getting, and if it is not the zakat, it is one of the obligations, then it says: The first saying: that it is a expressive of paying the warning needs, such as the food of the one who is obligatory This must be fulfilled by the text and the mind: As for the text, it is said to him by prayer and peace: Fatima Bint Qais: That the money is really in the money, and then he followed and the money came to (P-36) his love and narrated from the people that he was asked, so he has a money for him, so he has a money for him So?He said: Yes, it will reach the kinship, and give the liquid, then follow this verse.As for the mind, it is not different that if the pilgrim endes to the harm, it is necessary for people to give him the amount of payment They are upon them, and if they prohibit from giving, it is permissible to take them from them, so this indicates that this orphan is obligatory.And those who stabbed this saying in this saying about what was narrated on the authority of me, may God be pleased with him, said: Zakat has copied every right.The answer: From the faces: the first: that he is opposed to what was narrated that he is peace and blessings be upon him, he said: “In money there are rights except zakat.The second: The nation has gathered that if the obligatory attended, then it is obligatory to be paid to him what the warning pays, and if he has paid the zakat in the midst.The third: What is meant is that zakat has copied the powerful rights, but he who is not estimated is that it is not a fence with a manner that it is necessary to believe in the belief.According to the relatives, and on the mammal, and that is not estimated, then it was said: He gave it that it is true this interpretation, but what is the rule in this path?We said in it: Because the poor, if it is close, is the first of the charity from others where it is that of that universal between the prayer and the honesty, and that the closeness is from the one who is in the authority of the money He inherits the inheritance and deems it because of the money in the commandment, so that it does not enable the commandment except in the third, and for that, the will of the commandment was from the one who said: It was written on you if one of you attended the death [Al -Baqarah: 180] The verse, and if that commandment is, it has become a texture except when some of them, then this is the same Follow him with a fatte.Because the small, the poor who has no parent or a cup, is the interruption of the trick from all the faces, then followed them with the remembrance of the poor; Because the pilgrim might be tired of them, then Ibn al -Sibil mentioned, when his need was tightened when he increased his desire to his family, then he remembered the questioner; Because their need is without the need for those who give his remembrance.And the second: that the knowledge of the woman with the strictness of the need for this difference is strengthened and weakened, and the high remembrance of this difference is arranged on this face; Because his knowledge is strongly the need for someone who is close to him, then with the need of orphans, then the need of the poor, then on this form.And the third: that the kinship is poor, and it has an increased liquid that it is specialized; Because the intensity of the pilgrimage is in it, it will be harmed and the heart is paid, and the payment of the circle from the soul is presented to pay the warning from others, so that God began to start with God.With my orphans, the poor are late; Because the grief in the causes of the children of the children from food and drink is more severe than the grief that has the causes of the elderly of the adults from their crops His need is in the time, and the liquid may be a rich, the severity of the need, and the last of the offices; because The removal of tenderness is not in the place of the severe need.The second saying: that what is meant by giving money is what was narrated that he is praying and peace at his remembrance of the camels.Because the need for the custody of the solution is something that Ibn al -Sibil, the liquid, and the offices are not summed up.The third saying: that the payment of money to these was obligatory, and then it became a fool of zakat, and this is also weak; Because it is the Almighty in this verse between this orphans and between Zakat.The second question: As for the distress of the kinship, it is among the people who carried that on the masculine in the verse of the nafleh and the generosity, (P-37) and more than the one who is the one For those who are given, and it is correct because they are more special, and his counterpart is the Almighty saying: The first of the righteous is not brought up from you and the capacity is that they are the first of the kinship [Al -Nur].And know that the distress of the kinship are those who are close to it with the birth of the two parents or the birth of the two of the two, so there is no face to the palace of that on the one who is the one who is forbidden People; Because the forbidden is a legal rule, as for the kinship, it is a lukewarm memorial for the relative in the proportions, even if the one who sees in this way is that it is done in that And the distance, but the orphans are in the people who carried it on the whims of the orphans, he said: Because he does not improve from the believer to pay the money to the one who does not distinguish, and does not distinguish it, and does not distinguish So when he did that, it will be wrong, but if the yatim is a wicked, disobeying with the occurrence of his luck, and the charity will be from the door of what is eaten and wore, and it is not hidden from the one Including with it, it is permissible to pay it to it, this is all on the saying of those who said: The orphan is the one who has no father with the minor, and when our companions are the same, the name is upon the authority of the name, And the argument in which it is said is the Almighty: and they come to the millions of their money [Women: 2] and it is known that they do not pay money except if they reach, and the Messenger of God ﷺ is called: the father of my father, On this, if the yoga is in the language, the money is paid to it, otherwise he will be paid to his guardian.As for the poor, it has a disagreement, we will remember it, if God wills, the exalted in Surah al -Tuba.And whom we say here: The poor people are the people of the Hajj, then they are two strikes; Some of them are the one who stops the question, which is what is meant here, and for those who ask and simplify, and it is what is meant by his saying: The questioners, but the separation of the exalted between them from where it is from the authority It appears from his condition, and not like that; Because with his question, he knows his poverty and his argument, and the son of Al -Sibil was narrated on the authority of Mujahid that he is the traveler, and on the authority of Qutah that he is the guest; Because he came to you from the way, and the first is like; Because the path is a name for the veil and the traveler was made for him to his obligation, as it is said to the water of water: the son of water It is said to the man who came to the Sunnah: The son of the days.And for the courage: the children of the war.For people: the children of time.Dhu al -Ruma said: I repeated a dinner and the ritual, as if it was on the top of the head, the son of a rum He entered into this Muslim verse and the infidel, Al -Hosan narrated Ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them, that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Those who are in their numbers are the right to be known to the liquids and the mihrab [Al -Maarij: 24-25].* * * As for his saying: In the neck, there are two issues: the first question: the neck is the collection of the neck, and it is the delay of the origin of the neck, and its detection from the monitoring, The extent of the honorable nickname for the people, and for this meaning it is said: God has greeted his surgery, and it is not said: God has greeted his neck; Because when she was called a neck, as if she was watching the torment, and from this it is said to those who do not live her son: Raqoub, for the sake of her deaths, her son.The second question: the meaning of the verse: the money is brought in the dignity of the neck.He bought it and takes care of it, and whoever is its offices, then it will help him to perform his book.The support of the offices, who is the first of this verse on the zakat on the vocalist, then it will be in it that of that difference, and whoever carries this (P-38)) The two things are in a piece, and from the people who carried the verse on a third side, which is the redemption of the captives.And know that the completeness of the words in the interpretation of these items will come if God wills exalted in Surah Al -Tuba in the interpretation of charity.* * * The third matter: It is one of the things that are considered to be fulfilled by the righteousness of the righteousness: it is not the righteousness that the righteousness is to be assumed, and that is presented.The loyal matter: His Exalted, the Exalted: Those who died in their covenant if they pledged and have two questions: the first question: in lifting.Its estimated: but the believers and the people who are blessed, for the free and the light.The second: Raising the praise be to be a beginner, deleted, and its estimation: they are the ones who are.The second question: In what is meant by this covenant, the first: The first: that what is meant is what God has taken from the righteous By doing its limits, and working with his charity, the servants accepted that where they believed in the prophets and the books, and God has informed the people of the book, and they are the best of the book.He commanded them to fulfill it, and he said: My family, I remember my grace that I have been blessed with you and fulfilled With my covenant, I will fulfill your covenant [Al -Baqarah: 40] So the meaning was in this verse that the righteousness is what was mentioned from the works with the one who is in the covenant of God, not as it was fulfilled With his efforts, they fell asleep, killing them, and lied to his writing, and the judge was subjected to this saying and said: His saying is the Almighty: and those who are happy with this To them, then he is the highness that confirmed that: If they pledged, then he does not face his load on what he will be obliged to be ahead of him.The answer to it: It is up to them, and if these things are obligatory, but they have themselves, and they accepted that commitment and commitment, so it is correct from this guidance.The second saying: That is to be carried on the things that the cost of the cost is made by itself.And know that this covenant is either between the servant and between God, or between him and between the Messenger of God, or between him and between the people With the vows and faith, and the one between him and between the Messenger of God is the one who has pledged the Messenger upon him at the sale of the sale of support His norms, and the one between him and between the people of the people will be from the requirements such as what is obligatory in the contracts It is obligatory in peace and mortgages, and that is from the delegates like the one who is given to the dates in the humiliation of money and the salvation in the supporters, so he said: All of these sections are carried out, so there is no meaning to the shortness of the verse on some of these sections without some, and this is what we said is the one who has expressed from it, then they are the one who said: They promised to be struggled and if they were swollen and vowed, they are loyal, and if they said, they will believe, and if they believed, they will pay it, and among them is those who carried it on the saying of the Almighty: and for those who have given us: The verse.* * * The fifth command of the matters that are considered to be the realization of the righteousness: the words of the Almighty: and the patients in the women and the harm (P-39) and when the misery and the one who asks: In the text of the “Saberin” sayings: The first: Al -Kisa’i said: He is kind to the kinship, as if he said: The money came to his love with the distress of the kinship and the Saber.The grammarians said: The estimation of the verse becomes like this: but the righteousness is the one who believes in God and the money came to his love with the distress of the kinship and the Saber, so he said: Who is from.His saying: And those who are able to be presented to his saying: The patients are kind to (who), then you have been overwhelmed Obtained; Because the connection with the prayer is with a single name, and it is referred to describe the name, confirm, or to be overlooked after after His blame and his fulfillment of all his parts, but if you made his saying: and those who fell up with praise, and you have known that this chapter is other than this Because the praise is a sentence, if the chapter is not permissible with the individual, then it is not permissible in the sentence, it was first.If it was said: Is it not permissible for the separation between the beginning and the informing of the sentence as the saying of the one who said: If an increase is a understanding of what I say a man of a scholar, and the saying of the one who says: Al -Salihah, we do not waste the reward of those who did the best of the work [Cave: 30] Then he said: (Those), so separate between the beginning and the informing of his saying: We do not waste.We said: The connection with the prayer is like one one, so the comment between them is more severe than the comment between the beginning and the news, so it is not necessary than the journey of the good His permissibility between the connection and the link.The second saying: The saying of the female: It is a stapler on the praise, even if it is from the adjective of whom, but the “Mawafn” raised “and the“ Sabbar ”of the” and the prolongation of the words of the words, Praise and on the defamation, if the words are prolonged with the coordination in the characteristic of the one thing, and the chanting of the deceased: ؎ To the king of the Qaram and Ibn al -Hammam, and the absence of the abuse in the misery, and they said: Hattab [Al -Masd: 3] and they said to the one who reads: He stabbed the holder that he was on the authority of the defamation.It is violated with its Arabs and does not make all of them a neighbor on its Sufism; Because this position is one of the positions of the sneezing in the description and the elaboration in the saying, then if it is enveloped with the Arabs of descriptions, the intended is more complete; Because the words when the disagreement of the Arabs becomes as if it is a kind of speech and a barrier of bayat, and when the union in the Arabs is one and one and one sentence.Then the Kufic and the Basris cost that the praise and the vilification of what they became two are the same to disagree with the movement?Al -Farah said: The origin of the praise and the slander is from the words of the Samaid, and this is that if a man tells others, then he said to him: You mentioned the sane, that is, he and God, the righteous, is the sane person, so he wanted to speak to praise the same as what he praised with the smile, so the Arabs will be done, and he said: They are erected in the sense: I mean the fool, and the frequency denies that for two John: The first: that “I mean” it is an interpretation of the name of the Mujahil, and the praise.The second: If it was true what the Khalil said was correct to say: The increase of your brother rose, in the sense: your brother means, and this is what the Arabs did not say originally.He knew that among the people who read (and the deceased) (and the patients), and among them who read (and the deceased) and (the patient).(P-40) As for his saying: In the women, Ibn Abbas said: He wants poverty, and it is a name of misery And the harm said: He wants the sick with him, and they are a world of effective and do not do them; Because they are not a long time and when the signs, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: He wants to fight in the path of God and jihad, and the meaning of the misery is in the language of the severity: That is, there is no severity with a miserable torment [Al -A'raf: 165] and then the war is called a bad thing for the severity, and the torment is called a hill to intensify it.[Ghafir: 84], so when they felt our tongue [Al -Anbiya: 12], so whoever escapes from the evening of God [Ghafir: 29].* * * Then the Almighty said: Those who believed, that is, the people of these descriptions are those who believed in their faith, and the one mentioned the mercy of God in this He said: These are the wings in the descriptions in this verse for the collection, and it is from the bars of righteousness and the perfection of the condition of the righteous to collect in it these description The description of the righteousness, so it is not necessary for a person to think that the one who died in his covenant is from the sentence of the righteousness, and so is the patient in the women, but it is not the same Sigans, and for that some of them said: This is a special characteristic of the Prophet, peace be upon them.Because others do not collect all of them, and others said: This is general in all believers.And what is fulfilled only by God, upon which I trust.O you who believe, have been written for you in the free killing of the free and the servant with the servant and the female with the female, so whoever is forgiven for him from his brother is a good thing for him That is a reduction from your Lord and mercy, so whoever takes after that, he has a painful torment.
