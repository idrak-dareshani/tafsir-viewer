The Quranic researcher (P-80) [Surah Al-Mutififin] Thirty Six Mentioned verses ﷽ and a follower for those who are desperate who are those who are overflowing with people, they will be fulfilled, and if they do And it is for those who are desperate who are those who are overwhelmed by people, and if they are like an illusion or their weight, they lose, know that the first contact of this surah is the last Dahir, because he is the highest in the end of that surah that the day of resurrection is a day of his class that it does not have a soul for something that is something, and the matter is the same Great to the disobedience, for this followed him with his saying: Woe to the ripples and the meant by the mud from the sophistication, which is the underestimation in the place and the balance of the one who is in the place The hidden, and that is because the many appear and it is forbidden from it, and that few if it appears is also prevented from it, so we know that the softening is the lip On the way of the hidden, and here is the issues: the first question: the night, a word that is mentioned at the stains of the calamity, it is said: Woe to you, and a night on you.The second question: in the derivation of the descendant, the saying.The first: that the slave of the thing is its side and its letters, it is said: the valley and the vessel are fled, if the thing is in which the thing is in which it is not filled with his navigator, and it is not filled, then his hypocrisy, his drought, his drought, and his drought: The milestones and his drought are shed, if he is close to his fullness, but he was not filled, and this is said: for the one who offends the calamity and does not fulfill it, it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means.And the second: It is the saying of the gospel: that it was said to the one who decreases the inhabitants and the balance is desperate, because it is the one who does not steal in the merits and the balance, except the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good Questions: The first: that the choice is the adoption of the end, such as the balance, to take over, then the used language is said: I have been made from so -and -so, and it is not said: Here?.Answer: From two voices: The first: when their idols were among the people in which there is a relic of them and the burden of them, they are established on a place of the indication of that.The second: Al-Farah said: What is meant is from people, and on this position (P-81), they are met because he is a right to him, so if he said, he said, then he said to you, then he said to you, then he said to you I was from you, and it was like it, I was satisfied with you.The second question: is that the usual language is said to be like them, or they weighed for them, and it is not said that all of it and his loser are said, so what he said is the Almighty: and if they are shared or weighed?The answer is from the faces: the first: that what is meant by his saying is like an illusion or weighed them as a to them or weighed them, so the neighbor was deleted and the verb was connected.Al -Kisae and Al -Farah said: This is one of the words of the people of the Hijaz, and whoever brings them say: Heaven is like this, both of this, and they say I will repel you and I repel you, and I have caught you, and I have caught you, so I have been for you In the illusion and weigh them in the position of a staple.The second: to be on the addition of the added, the establishment of the added to it, and the appreciation: and if it is the same as their deposit, or weighed their balance.The third: It is narrated from Issa ibn Umar and Hamza that they were making the two guerrillas confirmation of what is in the cake and standing at the waters And the gospel is that it is not permissible, because it was if it was in the sense of the illusion, it was in the Mushaf a thousand stressed before they were, and the owner of the "scout" was exposed, so this is the one who said: The journalist was not taken into account in a lot of it.The answer is that the proof of this thousand if it was not used to the time of the companions, then it was obligatory to prove it in the journey The thousand was used to the time of the companions, so it was necessary to prove it.The third question: What is the reason for that he said: It is a follower for those who are kinds who if they are grateful and did not say if they are balanced, then he said: And if the illusion or weighs them, then collect them?The whole and the adultery with them are the purchase and the sale, so one of them is indicative of the other.The loyal question: the used language is that his loss is said, so what is the direction in his brother?The answer said the gospel: I lost the scales and lost it together, that is, it was shortened, and from the historical, they lose the loser of the Quraysh language.The third question: On the authority of Akrama, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: When the Prophet of God came to the city, they were among the most luxurious people, so God Almighty revealed this After that, and it was said that the people of the city were traded, and they were softened, and their rituals, the touches, and the risk were, so this verse was revealed, so the verse was brought up On them, and he said, “Fifth in Fifth”, it was said, O Messenger of God, and five in five?He said: What the people of the covenant have gone beyond, except God, their enemy, and what they governed otherwise, what God has revealed, except for the poverty, and the poverty did not appear in them The death, and they did not stop the whole, but the plants are forbidden and taken with the Sunnah, nor prevented the zakat except for the rain of them.They take an increase, and they pay a minor, then the scholars differed, so some of them said: This verse is indicative of the return, so do not take over, unless it is up to the time The stolen, and others said: Rather, it does not change and enlarges the entry of the return Fifth: The companions of the returnee were in general, this verse, they said: This is the verse and a response in the people of prayer, not in the infidels, and the one who indicates to him and the first.That disbelief is the first to make this night from (P-82) Tafafi, then it was not then for the sophistication of a effect on this money, but the verse indicates that the obligatory for this guardian is the righteousness: For those who address this verse: Do not think that they are close to a great day.He only gets with the believer, so you have proven these two guys that this return is specialized in the people of prayer, and the answer is: for it is what is presented, and it is for the sake of this Al -Waqid will inform those who do that and whoever is determined by him, as he is determined to him also from the cabares.He knows that the matter of the merit and the balance is great, and that is because the general character of creation needs the customers and it is built on the matter of the kingdom and the balance, for this is the Lord of God The sky raised it and put the scales [Rahman: 7] Do not overwhelm the balance [Rahman: 8] and evaluate the loser by the installments and do not lose the balance [Rahman: 9] And we descended with them the book and the balance so that the people will do the installment [Al -Hadid: 25] and on the authority of Qatada: And on the authority of Al -Fadil: The Balance of Budget is the face of the day of resurrection, and an Arab said to the servant of King Bin Marwan: You have heard what God Almighty said!He wanted this that the wandering has directed the great return in taking a few, so what you thought of yourself and you take the many, and do not take the ritual And adulterers.
