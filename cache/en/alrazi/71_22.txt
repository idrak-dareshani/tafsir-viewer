The third Quranic researcher: One of the doors of their actions is the Almighty saying: and they are a great deceitful Farm many and do not increase the oppressors except a misguidance in which the questions are: the first question: and they are dedicated to those who did not increase it; Because those who are rumored are those who are deceived, and they said to the followers, do not vow, and the collection of the guerrilla while he is returning to whom; Because it is in the sense of collection.The second question: Reading “old” and “adults” by lightness and disturbance, and it is exaggerated in the oldest, the first of the great and the most elderly, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, the adults, and the adults, and the adults.The majority of confusion, and its counterpart: beautiful, beautiful, generous, great, bones, greatness, long, long and long.The third question: the older is that they said to follow them: and do not warn up, so they prevented the people from the neutrality, and they commanded them to be evil Display, there is no crime that was forbidden from him, the greatest of the cabinets, for this, and God has described it as the oldest Baby in ugliness and treasures.The following question: It is up to him, but he called it a deity for what is in the divine addition to them from the trick obligated to their future to their worshipers, as if they said: The gods are for you, and the gods were for your fathers, so if you accepted the saying of Noah, you would have confessed to yourself that you were ignorant of those who were disbelievers, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you.The human being on himself, and on all his ancestors with shortness, deficiency, and ignorance, hard, hard, the sign has become to these suffering, with the words of your family For the sake of the detection of this speech on this hidden trick, God called their words “angel”.The second: He transcended those who were rumored that they had money and a child, so perhaps they said to follow them: Your family is better than the God of Noah; Because your gods give you money and the father, and God is a Noah that does not give him anything because it is a poor, for this is the most distant, they have forgotten them from the obedience of Noah, and this is the same He said: Is it not for me the king of Egypt [Al -Zakhrif: 51] and he said: Or I am better than this who is insignificant and hardly shows, if not to be thrown on it, a wallet is from a gold [53].* * * Fifth question: Abu Zayd Al-Bakhi mentioned in his book in the response to the slave of idols: that knowledge is that this wood (P-127) is the sculpture in this For the heavens, the earth, the plants, and the animal, the science is a fierce, and the fierce sciences are not permissible and the conflict falls between the minds, and the worship of the second is a debt that was a debt that was a debt that was a debt that was a religion Noah, peace be upon him This verse, and that religion has been darkened to this time, and the most inhabitants of the perpetrator of the perpetrator on this religion, so this religion is required to be pregnant with the face of the face of it The mind, otherwise this is the time that is in the past in the most part of the world, then it is imperative that it be for those who are gone to that gaming, the one who said: The twentieth of Ja`far ibn Muhammad al -Mujahim: This is the article, but it was born from the golden people who say that God is a body, and in the place, and that is because they said: The lights, and the angels who are barefoot around the throne, which is its place, are small lights with the lineage to that great light, for those who have been hidden from this The greatest idols on the image of their gods, who have been held, and took varying idols, with great, small, honorable, and underestimating the image of the angel With the worship of those idols, they are able to worship God and the angels, so the servants of the second are the one who appeared from the inconsistency.The second face: that the group of the Sabean was alertly that the great god created this constant and the calendar, and the hand of this is the world, and this is the same as the world.The good people are the servants of this man, and the makers are the great servants of God, for human beings must worship the worshipers Last, they took idols on their images and used to worship them, and they were abused by the worshipers of the makers.The third face: that the people who were in the forefront of forever, they were stolen on the people of the rulings, in the additions of this world, and the whispers of the A wondrous form that is righteous for a huge character, so they were taking that smile, and he appeared from him, strange conditions and great effects, and they were glorified, and they were glorified They honored him and occupied his worshipers, and they took every smile on a form that is agreed upon for a special confusion and a special path, so he said: And there are noits to a woman’s image, and he is grabbing a lion, and impedes a firm image, and a broken picture of a flexible image.The loud face: that the righteous people were righteous, and they were taking the same for their pictures and they were overwhelmed They died until they would be honored by God, and he is what is meant by their saying: We do not worship them except to bring us closer to God Zifi [Al -Zamer: 3].The fifth face: that perhaps a great king died, or a great person, so they were taking a proverb on his images and looked at him, so they came to him Their fathers used to worship them, so they occupied their worshipers to imitate the fathers, or perhaps this is the fifth names, which are: friendliness, kindness, and glowing, It is hindered, and a flexibility, the names of five of the children of Adam, and when they died, Absis said to those after them: If you were photographed, then you would look at them, then you would have seen them He said to those after them: They worshiped them, and they worshiped them, and for this reason, the Messenger, peace be upon him, forbade the visit of the graves first "I had forbidden you from the visit of the graves, not to visit it, because it is a reminder." Sixth: Those who say: It is a body of body, and it is permissible for him to resign and solution That idol, taking the face of the nickname, is a wondrous condition, and he was in the way that the God has obtained in that idol, and for that, then it is a group of the ritual Upon him, peace be upon him, the chapter of Khaybar, and that was the disagreement of the habit.The next face: Perhaps they took those idols such as the wizard and their intensity with worship is God, so this (P-128) is a sentence in this door, and some of them are the same It is proven that it is not in the conscience of the hero of taking the idol on the image of God, and the proliferation of the saying is also with solutions and descent, and when you have been stated that he is the Almighty The saying of the platform and the bonds, and when the law came with the prohibition from taking the idol, the saying of the saying of its incest and luxury.The sixth question: These are the five idols, their idols, then they were transmitted from the people of Noah to the Arab For a sacrifice, hinders for a meter, and a pleasure to protect.Therefore, the Arabs named the servant of a friend, and a servant who is giving up, so it was said in the books, and it has a disorder; Because the world has been raised in the time of the flood, how did these idols remain, and how did they take to the Arabs?It cannot be said: Noah, peace be upon him, put it in the travel and hold it because it is peace be upon him, but it came to its exile and broken it, so how can it be said: Seek it in its memorization.The seven question: Reading: For the Quraysh, and it is the name of Amr ibn Abd Waddi, and I say: On the saying of the polls, it is not permissible for us to say that there is no one in the guarantee, because this is not in this.The states of Quraysh, and Al -Amash read: This is a problematic reader; Because if they were Arab or two years, then they are the reason for preventing the scourge, either the definition and the adultery Their sisters are displayed Waders, kinds and ease.And he knew that Noah, when he told them that they said to follow them: Do not distract your gods, he said: And they have lost a lot in it and Jahan: the first: the first of those who are the ones.Before these people, who are the worship of idols, and this is not the first time they used to deliver.The second: It is permissible for the guerrilla to be domesticated to idols, as his saying: They are a lot of people from the people [Abraham: 36] and the idols are made on this saying As his saying: Agam is a man [Al -Arif: 195], and as for his words, the Almighty does not increase the oppressors except a misguidance, so they have two questions: the first: how is the satellite of the saying:??(Answer) As if Noah, peace be upon him, is what I have been in the number of their actions, and their words are the dumbh To them.The second question: Rather, he was sent to distract them from the misguidance, so how can he pray to God to increase their misguidance?(Answer) from two voices: The first: Perhaps it is not the intention of misguidance in the matter of religion, but the misguidance in the matter of their world, and in the irritation of their custody and their tricks.The second: the delusion of torment for its saying: the criminals are in delusion and pricing [the moon: 47].Then it is up to him when he told the words of Noah, peace be upon him, he said after him: What their sinners were placed, and they entered a fire and in which there are questions: what is the question: As we will take them [Al -Nasa: 155], as Rahma [Al -Amran: 159], which is the meaning of their sins, that is, for its sake and its causes, and the son of Mas'oud read: “From the sins of them.” He was late in a word, and on this reader, it is not an excessive prayer; Because what is after it is in the source of the source.
