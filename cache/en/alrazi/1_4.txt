The Quranic researcher (P-192) The Folkl-Flag is the interpretation of his saying: The money of the Day of Religion, and in which the first claim of the first: His saying: The money of the day of the debt, that is, the money of the debt And it is reported that it is necessary from the difference between the good and the forefathers, the obedient and the disobedient, the agreement and the violator, and that does not appear except on the day of the penalty, as he said: By what they did and reward those who are good with goodness [Al -Najm: 31] and he said: Or do we make those who believe and do righteousness like the spoilers in the land, or we are the same as 8] He said: The hour is coming to almost hide it to reward every soul with what you see For miracle or for ignorance, or for his being satisfied with that darkness, and this three qualities of God Almighty, so he must do the one who will be in the way This righteousness has not obtained in the home of the world, and it must be obtained in the house of the other after the house A good atom that the verse sees [the earthquake: 7].Enter paradise with your work, and he says: My God, what did you do?And God Almighty says: Did you not sleep when you were asleep, you turned from one side to the side of the night, so you said in this way, “God” and then the sleep of you, then you will be in the case of the time?As for me, do not take me for a year or sleep, as I have forgotten that, and also comes with a man and weighs his good deeds and his goodness, so you will be afraid of his goodness, so he will be fed up, so he will be fed up, so he will be.His balance, if there is a testimony that there is no god but God, then he will not be burdened with the remembrance of God, others.And know that the obligations are on two sections: the rights of God Almighty, and the rights of worshipers.As for the right of God, he was blessed, we built it on the forgiveness; Because it is a richness of the two worlds, and the rights of worshipers, which is the one who must be unable to do so.It was narrated that Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him, had some money, so he went to his house to ask him for him, so when he arrived at the door of his house, he was on the authority of his house.We raised him, so the impurity took place from his heart and signed on the surroundings of the Magawsi house, and Abu Hanifa was confused and said: If I left it, then this was a reason for this And if I rubbed it, the dust was beaten from the wilderness, so the door was knocked, so the neighbor came out, and he said to it: Say to me to the king: that Abu Hanifah is in the door, and he came to him, so he will come to him, and he will come to him So he took a referee, and Abu Hanifa said, may God be pleased with him: Here we are what is first, and he mentioned the story of the wall, and that he is how the way is to be cleaned, so he said: By purifying myself, I became Muslim immediately.And the joke in it is that Abu Hanifah is when he was embarrassed by the injustice of the Mujw ’in that little destiny of injustice, so for the sake of the leaving it, that is from the condescension of the one who is from the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who moves from the one who is from On the dark, how can God be upon God Almighty.The second one: the readers differed in this word, for those who read: the money of the Day of Religion, and among them who read: “the king of the Day of Religion”.The pilgrimage of the one who read “Malik” Wooh: The first: that there is an excessive letter, and his readers were more rewarded.The second is that he gets a lot of domain.As for the right money to the Day of Religion, it is only God.The third: Money may be a king and it may not be, as the king may be a money and may not be, for the king and the royal may be separated from each of them.المالِكِيَّةَ سَبَبٌ لِإطْلاقِ التَّصَرُّفِ, والمِلْكِيَّةُ لَيْسَتْ كَذَلِكَ, فَكانَ المالِكُ أوْلى.The lord: that the king is a king of the pioneer, and the king is a king of the slave, and the servant is soaked in the past of parish, so the abundance in the money is more than the money in the money (P-193) So the money should be higher than the king.Fifth: The parish can be made of themselves from their being, a parish for that king by choosing themselves It is full of that money for the choice of itself, so it was proven that the consent in the money is fully fully in the property.Sixth: The king must sponsor the state of grace, and peace and blessings be upon him: “All of you are a shepherd, and all of you are responsible for his parish.” As for the mockery, it is obligatory for him to serve the money and that he does not take an issue except with his permission, so that he is not valid from the judiciary, the imamate, and the imamate, and the imamate, and the martyrdom, A traveling, and if he intended his residence, he became a resident; We learned that the purity and the subjugation in the Mamluki that I have completed in his being parietal, for this is the faces indicating that the money is fully fully than the king.And the Hajj of those who said that the king is the first of the money, and it is the first: the first: that every one of the people of the country is your money, but the king is only the greatest and highest of them, so the king is more honorable.The second: They gathered on the authority of his saying: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the people of the king of people [Al -Nas: 1] The king would notice in which he is a sinner, and if only the king is higher than that of money.The third: The king is first because it is shorter, and the most promising is that it is realized from the time in which this word is mentioned in it, with the disagreement of the money, so it is more What is in which this word is fulfilled, so he was transferred from Abu Amr, and the Kasayi answered that he said: I am allab in the remembrance of this word, so if it is not It was informed of it, as I had it, where I was determined to it, its counterpart in the lava, whoever intended the fast to tomorrow before the sunset from the day in the days of the day, not in the days of the day.Because on this day, they are in a way that this day is on this day, then if he intended the fast of tomorrow, that was a longing for hope, but if he intends after the sunset, then he will not be the sun.Because, even if it is a development of the hope, it is out of the fast with the sunset, and it is permissible to die in that night, and for the night, then he says: It is less than that I will be with the determination of fasting, such as this is the one who is mentioned in the remembrance of his saying, “Malik”, then if you do it, then that, and if he did not appreciate it, he was unlike it.Then we say: It is separated by the king of the king of rulings, and on his own money is more rulings.As for the rulings that are unable to be the king of the king, the first: the first: that the politicians on four sections: the policy of the owners, the policy of the crops, the policy of the angels.The policy of the dowry is stronger than the policy of the owners; Because if a world of money gathered, they do not reside with one king, not to see that the master does not possess the residence of the limit on his mantle, with my father, and the one who is on the authority of the father The residence of the limits possesses the people, and the policy of the angels is above the policies of the dowry; Because a world is one of the dignitaries of those who are dwelt, they cannot pay the policy of one king, and the policy of the king of the Malouk is that it is above the policies of the angels, not to see it to the saying And the angels are a class that does not speak except for those who authorize the mercy and said it is correct [Al -Naba: 38] and the words of the Almighty: Whoever intercede for him, and he said: They only intercede for those who are satisfied [Al -Anbiya: 28] So, O Malouk.The policy of the king is what you are afraid of the policy of the king of Malouk, who is the owner of the Day of Religion.The second judgment is one of the rulings of its exalted king: that it is a king that does not resemble the captives of those who died, because if they believe in something (P-194), they decreased their kingdom, and they said: As for the truth, it is the same and its angel, its king does not diminish with giving and charity, but it will increase, in his two years that he is up to you if he gave you one son, and he did not turn to the one who is not.If he gave you ten of the children, his judgment and his cost was necessary for all, so you have proven that he was the highest of the more bid, the more welcoming.The third judgment is one of the rulings of its king: as the mortality of mercy, and the evidence has verses: no one: what was mentioned in this surah from his kindness, may God bless him.وثانِيها: قَوْلُهُ تَعالى: هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لا إلَهَ إلّا هو عالِمُ الغَيْبِ والشَّهادَةِ هو الرَّحْمَنُ The Most Merciful [Al -Hashr: 22] Then he said after him: He is God who has no god but He, the king [Al -Hashr: 23] Then he mentioned after him, as he is a lord of the dark Peace be upon him, and he who delivered his servants from his injustice and his wounds, then he mentioned after him as a believer, and he is the one who believes in his servants from his wounds, and he is his wounds, and he is not.It is only with the complexity of the mercy.And the third of it: His Exalted: The king is the right of the right to the Most Merciful [Al -Furqan: 26] When it was proven to the soul of the king, he added that it was described by the soul of his soul.The king is proven to him on that day, indicating the fullness of the oppression, so he formed a mercy that indicates the demise of fear and the mercy of the mercy.And its elevation: His Excellency said: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the people of the people of the people [Al -Nas: 1] So he mentioned first as a Lord for people, then he will be buried with the same Indicating that the king does not improve and completely complete with charity and mercy, so you, Malouk, hear these verses and have mercy The King of God Almighty.The ruling that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been obedient to him, for you are immortalized, and they did not obey him, and the fall of the ritual and the arrival in the world, and the arrival of the ritual The world and the annihilation of creation, when you witnessed that the violation of the rewarding king leads to the last thing to dedicate the world and the annihilation of creation, so look at the opponent of the king of the Malik, how is it.The removal of the reconciliation and the crushers of the corrupt?And his decree is that it is high, indicating that the infidelity is because of the crowning of the world.The son of [Maryam: 90] and indicated that his obedience was a reason for the reconciliation.What is the parish, be obedient to your king The fifth judgment: that when he described his soul with his king, a king of the day of religion, he appeared to the two scholars as the option of his justice, and he said: What is your Lord with a shadow: How to justice is: We put the budgets for the day of the resurrection, so do not be wronged as anything It appears in the cause of justice, if the king is a true king, it was a true king, otherwise it was a false king An unjust king who increased the good of the world.It is narrated that Anushuan went out to the hunter on one day and was overwhelmed in the rakia, and he cut off his sugar and took over the thirst on him, and he prayed to him Two bastards, when he entered that two gospels, he saw the trees of Raman, and he said to a boy, who attended in these two gospel He wore it, so many water came out from it, and he drinks it, and it was liked that of the thighs.So he gave it, and it came out, and he came out of it.The boy said: Perhaps (P-195) the king of the country is determined to dark The boy: He gave me another aspiration, so he gave it, and he found it, and he found it as a goodness from the first throw, so he said to the boy: Why did this be depleted?The boy said: Perhaps the king of the country repented from his injustice, and when he heard Anushuran, this story is from that boy, and it was a custody of the hearts of the heart of the heart of the heart, So the name of his name remained in the world, even if it is from the people who narrate from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: “I was born in the time of the Lord.” * * * As for the rulings that are separated from his money, it is four: the first judgment: the reader of money is more hope that the king's readers are.Because the maximum of justice and fairness, and that the human being escaped from him with heads, as for money He says: I am your possession, so do your food, your reward, and your paradise.The second judgment: The king, even if it is richest than money, is not that the king reassures you and the king is that you are in it, and we have no obedience or goodness, so he does not want to be a good.And the obstacles, but he wants to ask him for the day of the sake of forgiveness and forgiveness, and give paradise with the grace of preference, for this reason, the one said: Because this reader is the indication of the many virtues and the wide mercy.The third judgment: that the king is offered to him, and he is not accepted except for those who have the power of the body that the mood is correct Money, if he has a servant, then if he is a disease, he has his heavens, and if his help is weakened, and if he falls into a bread, he will be saved, for the sake of the money is worse for those who are grateful.The righteous judgment: the king has a hippo and a policy, and the king has a head and mercy, and our argument to the head and the mercy is more severe than our argument to the hippo and al -Sita.The third is a well -being of ability, for which he is a king and a king of emotion, here we are searching: It is that he is either to be a king For the first, the first is false, because [Translation
