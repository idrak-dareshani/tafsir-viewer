The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of it: You have a life, my first, the first people, so that you may fear.Know that he was glorified and exalted when he was obligated in the advanced verse, and the penalty was from the door of pain, and he asked him a question, which is to say: How can he be able to do the servant?For the sake of the payment of this question, the wise of the rule of the rule of the penalty, and he said: And you have a life in the penalty, and in the verse the questions: the first question: in the verse: This verse is that the same life is life; Because the penalty is an isolation of life, and the removal of something that is forbidden to be the same thing that is the thing, but it is intended that the proceeding of the penalty is that it leads to life in the right The right of those who want to make it a murderer and in the right of others as well, but in the right of those who want to be a killer, then if he knows that if he had killed the killing, then he would be killed, then he would be killed, then he would be killed Live, and in the right of those who want to make him a murderer, then whoever wants to kill him, if he is afraid of heasing, he will be left.The meeting of those who are killed, or whoever is concerned with it, and in their survival, with the meeting of those who fanaticism for them; Because the temptation is glorified by the killing, it leads to the warring that ends up to kill a world of people, and in the perception of the void of the quantity of the shame (P-49) (P-49) (P-49) His demise is the life of all.The second face: In the interpretation of the verse that what is meant is that the soul is the reason for life and that; Because the blood of blood, if he was restricted from him, he would deter those who were concerned with killing, and he did not kill, so the punishment was his soul because of life from this face, and he knew that the face is that It is not very elaborate with the height of the killing, in which he enters the retribution in the wounds and the pilgrims, and that is because if he knew that if his enemy is wounded, then he will be made from his enemy It becomes a reason for their survival; Because the journey does not believe in the death, and that is the wounded if it is made from it, and also the argument and the surgeon in which there is no steadfastness inside the verse; Because the wounded does not believe that his surgeons will lead to the soul of the soul, so it is necessary for the steps, so the fear of the stomach is the same.The third direction: that what is meant is a positive level of leveling, so what is meant is that in the positive level of leveling is a life for other killers; Because he is not killed by the other killers of what the people of the ignorance do, which is the saying of the Saddi.And the fourth face: the Abu al -Jawza read, and you are in the vicinity of life, that is, while the ruling of the killing and the penalil was said to you, and it was said: (Heasing) the Qur’an, that is, for you in the Qur’an in the Qur’an.As his saying: a spirit of our command [Al -Shura: 52] and revived whoever lives from evidence [Al -Anfal: 42].And God knows.* * * The second question: the scholars of the Bayan agreed that this verse is briefly with the collection The suffering of the language is the language to the highest degrees, and that; Because the Arabs crossed this meaning with many conservatives, such as their saying: some people killed a neighborhood for all, and the one said: The righteousness of them in this chapter is their saying: the killing was denied to kill, then if the Qur’an is pronounced, it is more correct than this, and the two people are more correct: it is: Life is more short than all; Because his saying: (And to you) does not enter into this section, as it is imperative in all of that of that; Because the saying of the one said: The killing of some is a neighborhood for all, in which it is possible to estimate the same, and so in their saying: the killing is exiled to the one who is not.You knew that his saying: in the penalty, there is a more severe life than their saying: the killing was exiled to kill.And the second: that their saying: the killing has denied the killing of its appearance, it requires the fact that the thing is because it is the same as its soul while it is referred, and it is said: in the vulnerability of the life of you.Because the masculine is a type of killing, which is the penalty, then he made it because of the divorce of life because he mentioned the life of a denial, but rather made it a captivity.And the third of it: that their saying: the killing has exiled to kill, in which there is a righteousness to the memorization of the killing, and his saying is: in the penalty as a life like that.And its booster: that the saying of the saying: the killing has exiled to the killing, it is not beneficial except the deterrent from the killing, and its saying: in the penalty a life that benefits the narrators from the one who is killed and from the murder and the one who is killed and the murderer from the killing of the murderer, It is a collection for fools.Fifthly: that the negation of the killing is required, as it is included in life.And its sixth: that killing is injustice to kill, with that it is not navigated to kill, but rather is because of the increase in the murder, but the exile of the death of the killing is the killing, which is the killing, which is the killing, which is the killing, which is the killing, which is the killing, which is the killing, which is the killing, Their saying of their saying is false, but the verse is correct and unable, and the recession appeared between the verse and between the words of the Arabs.* * * The third question: the disgraceful of this verse was brought up to the corruption of the people of the Sunnah of the Sunnah in their saying: that the one who does not kill.And they said: If the one who kills must die if he was not killed, then he will give the time of the penalty to be imposed Even his killing will die or not kill him, (P-50), then it is not the time of the legs of the vulnerability to bring life.If it was said: We say that he was killed, if he was not killed, he would die, and I would not want to kill him, and he would not be killed, so he would not have said that he said: How would he not be killed?If you say: He was dying, then you have ruled that it is the right of every time that his death was true that his death was like his death, and that is.It corrects what we have to do with you; Because it is necessary for you to be the one who is known that if he had not killed him; Either because he prohibited him from the killing, or that he was afraid of killing him that he was dying and in that correct what we have obligated, this is all the judge.As for the saying of the Exalted: O first people, what is meant by the minds who know the hills and know the flaws of fear, then if they want to take up, they kill them, and they kill them.They are asking for leaders, so that they are deterred; Because the sane person does not want to destroy otherwise by destroying himself, then if he is afraid of that, his fear is a reason for the palm and abstinence, except that this fear is from the one We mentioned it from whom he has a mind that guides him to this idea, so whoever has no mind guides him to this idea, he does not get this fear, so this is the good The rhetoric is the first.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: Perhaps you will fear in it: The information, and his answer is what preceded it in the words of the Almighty: O people, worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may fear [Al -Baqarah: 21].* * * His answer was also preceded in that verse.The third question: In the interpretation of the verse, they say: One of them: the saying of good and deaf that what is meant is that you fear the same killing.The second: that what is meant is piety from all faces and is not in the verse specializing in piety, so he carries it on all.It is known that God is exalted, but he wrote on the worshipers of hardships from the punishment and otherwise, for the sake of fearing that the fire is upset with the cultivation of the sins, and they will be sufficient for them.It was necessary to carry the words to him.The fifth judgment
