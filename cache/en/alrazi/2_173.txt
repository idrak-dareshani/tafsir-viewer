The researcher is the Almighty: He forbade you from the dead, blood, and the meat of the pink, and what is qualified for it for the other than God, so whoever is forced to be unjust, and there is no one who does not have a goodness, and there is no one who does not.Know that he was glorified and exalted when he commanded us in the righteous verse by the permissible of the permissible, and he separated in this verse for the types of forbidden.And the words are in it on two types: the first type: what is related to interpretation.And the second type: what is related to the rulings that the scholars have assigned from this verse.The first type has questions: the first question: I know that the word is on one of them: one of them: to be one letters, as you say: The second: To be (what) is separated from: “If” is (what) in the sense of the one that, as your saying: What you took your money, and if you have rode your dirt, and came in the ritual As for the first, he said: God is one of the women [Women: 171], but you are a vow [Hood: 12].As for the second, he said: “They made a warm,” [Taha: 69] and if you set up, “a wicked good” must make it “but one of the rituals, and it was a righteousness, and it was right.Without God, two things are between you [the spider: 25] The confinement, and begged him with the Qur’an, poetry and measurement; As for the Qur’an, the Almighty said: God is one of the women [Women: 171], meaning that it is only one deity, and he said: Rather, the charity is for the poor and the poor [repentance: 60] For Muhammad: Say: I am a human being like you [the cave: 110], meaning that I am only human beings like you.On a heal that he feeds only to be a dead or blood that is shed or the flesh of Khuzir [Al -Anam: 145], then the two verses became one, so he said: An interpreter of his saying: Say: I do not find what was revealed to me, just like that in that verse.And Al -Farazdaq said: I am the wicked, the wicked, but it is defended from his calculation of me or me like me and the measure, so it is that the word is that “for the sake of the words and the word (what is) Gathering, it is necessary to keep their origins; Either it is useful for the state of the masculine and the exile of the masculine - which is invalid with the agreement - or the state of the masculine is proven and the exile of the (P -11) is mentioned.And those who said: He does not benefit the exclusivity with his words: Rather, you are a vow [Hood: 12], and it was otherwise a vow, and his answer; Its meaning: You are nothing but a vow, so it benefits the confinement, and it does not deny the extent of other cars.The second question: Reading (forbidden) on the construction of the act And (deprived) for the children of the active and (forbidden) with a generosity.* * * It eats it, so God forbade blood, and his saying: (The flesh of the pingling) He wanted the pingle with all his parts, but it is special for meat; Because it is the intended to eat, and his saying: What is I have to do with the other of God.المالاليال The scandalous is a knee, as it is the passenger, this is the meaning of the essence in the language, and then it was said to the forbidden, which is free to raise the ritual of the voice, This is the meaning of the essence, it is said: the people of Falan with an argument or a life, that is, it is forbidden by it, and that is because it raises the voice with the coffin with the forbidden, and the sacrifice; Because the Arabs used to call the two at the sacrifice, and they raised their voices with its remembrance, and from it: the boy was notary, so he said: What is the right of God: For idols, which is the saying of Mujahid and the laughter and a murderer, and the Lord Bin Anas and Ibn Zaid said: It means what is mentioned to him other than the name of God, and this is the saying Because it is more accurate for the memorizer, the scholars said: If a Muslim slaughtered a sacrifice, and he intended to sacrifice her approximation to others, he became a slave, and this is a slave, The judgment is other than the sacrifices of the people of the book.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Whoever is forced to have anxes: the first question: a sophisticated reader, the son of Kathir, and the son of Amir and Al -Kisa’i: The guarantee of follow -up, and the breaking at the origin of the movement to meet the hookahs.The second question: He was forced: he was wrapped and resorted to, and he was made from the harm, and his origin is from the harm, which is the narrow.* * * The third question: When God has forbidden those things, these things are forbidden.The halal is blocked by the eye, so that it will be obligatory.The second: If he deals with him on his etc.The following question: that the persecutions are not from the actions of the cost, until it is said: He does not sin against him, God is forgiven, may God bless him So whoever is forced, then eat, do not sin against him, and the deletion is like a deletion in his saying: Whoever is from you is sick or on a traveler, then a number of days of other days [184] He was deleted, and he breaks and said: Whoever was sick or with him is more than his head, then a foolishness of fasting or charity [Al -Baqarah: 196] Faddia, but it is permissible to delete to the knowledge of those who address the deletion, and the rhetoric is upon him.* * * As for his words, he said: It is not a sake, so he has an questions: (P-12) The first question: Al-Farah (other) said: We do not reconcile to be in the sense of the one; Because (otherwise) is in the sense of negation, and for that he has composed it on it “no” because it is in the sense: No, and it is here a condition for the one who is obligated, as if you said: Whoever is forced, and there is no one.The second question: the origin of the prostitute in the language of corruption and the equivalent of the limit.The lean said: the prostitute in the enemy of the horse is fragmented and spirit, and that it is in the enemy.The unjust and the oppression of fairness, and its saying is the Almighty: And those who, if the prostitute, will be victorious.The sky was overwhelmed, if its rain increased until the limit would be overlooked, and the wound, the sea, and the clouds were overwhelmed if it is overwhelmed.As for the saying of the Exalted: It is no return, the enemy is the transgression in the matters, and the sympathy of what is empty is that it is insisted on it, it is said that it is an enemy, and it is an aggression, and it is an aggression, and it is an aggression, and it is an aggression, and it is an aggression, It is equivalent to the limit, and it is one of its brightness: its destiny.* * * The third question: for the people of interpretation in his saying: it is not a vagina and no one said: One of them is that his saying is otherwise, and no one is eaten.The second: to be a year in the most and others.As for the first saying, he is in his faces: the first: it is not a wig, and that is that the soul is hated by the soul, so it is amended to the eating of the forbidden, and no return.The second: it is not a lord of the pleasure, that is, a student for it, and no return is the coupling of the submission, on the authority of Hassan, Qatada, Al -Raba’i, and Mujahid and Ibn Zaid.The third: it is not a bastard on another obligatory, with the seizure of it, and no return in the dam.The second saying: That the meaning be unprecedented on the imam of the Muslims in the travel, from the prostitute, and no return in disobedience, that is, the equivalent of the right of the right, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the right of the right, The two interpretations of the other will come if God wills.* * * As for his saying: He does not sin against him, so he has two questions: one of them: that the most in that state is obligatory and his saying: He does not sin against him.The second: that the one who is forced, like the person who is referred to the verb and the refuge is not described as not to sin against it.158] The denial of the ingredient is the destiny between the obligatory, the delegate and the permissible, and also, and the Almighty said: So do not sin with it, with the lifting of the embarrassment, and the sake of the ritual, and the sacrifice, The lust of the dead was obtained in it, and there is no stretching in it.It is possible for that, but if the alienation is obtained The hardship is that it is due to that alienation that comes out of a refuge, and it is obligatory to take over the dead at what is from the alienation, and it is the meaning of the meant.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty is at the end of the verse: God is forgiving, merciful, and he has a form, which is that when he said: He does not sin against him, so how can he say: The forgiveness is at the time of the ingredient.And the answer: From the faces: one of them: that the prohibition is based on the dead and blood, except that the prohibition is still in order The prohibition is expressed by the forgiveness, then he mentioned after it that he is merciful, meaning for the sake of mercy to you, I will give you.And the second: Perhaps the obligatory man will increase the need for the need, so it is (P-13), it is forgiven to forgive his sin in the pioneering of the Ziyadah, the mercy of the authority.And the third of it: It is up to what these judgments showed, followed by it, forgiven, merciful.Because he is forgiven for the disobedience, if they repent, merciful to the obedients who are dominated by the ruling of his ruling, his ruling and the Almighty.* * * The second type: From the words in this verse of the jurisprudence that the scholars delegated from it, and it is an arrangement on a chapter: the first chapter in the words of what is related to what is Range on a submission and intentions: As for the presenter: it has three issues: the first question: they disagreed that the prohibition added to the two, does it require?Al -Karkhi said: It requires the bulls; Because the elders cannot be described as solution and prohibition, then they must be done to an action from our actions in it, and all our actions are forbidden; Because it is excluded from the soul and when the place is permitted to do the verbs in it, and it is not forbidden, then this must be made from this prohibition to the verb of the verb, and the verb is not, Some of the goods are required, and the most of the scholars are, they have insisted that it is not from the boundaries, but this is the word, in the vicinity of the These are the bodies, as the souls do not possess, but rather the fragments in them, so if it is said: So that it has a neighbor, so every one is that it is that he owns it.We are excluded from the words of the text in the science of origins.The second question: when the origin that we presented is proven, the verse must be indicated by the sanctity of all the notifications, except what the indicators are brought out by the special This is a specialization of this prohibition of eating, and which is indicated by his faces: one of them: that the two of the incorrects is forbidden by the dead.And secondly: He replied to the head of his saying: they are among the good things that we have given you.And the third of it: What was narrated from the Messenger, peace be upon him, in the news The sheep of Mimon, but it was deprived of the dead.The answer to the first: We do not surrender that the compatibility is from the prohibition of deadness, forbidding its eating.And on the authority of the second: that this verse is independent of itself, so it is not obligatory to limit it to what is presented, but it must be done on its appearance.And on the third: that the phenomenon of the Qur’an is presented on the news of the one, but this is evaluated if it is not permissible to be permissible to specialize the Qur’an with the news The Muslims were returned in the definition of the face of the sanctity to this verse, so the convening of their gathering indicated that it is not the same as the most This consensus is prevented.* * * The third question: the dead is where the language is the one who came out of being a neighborhood without the abuse of structure, and for that, they separated from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from It is not the consumer, either because it was not slaughtered or was slaughtered, but it was not a slander.We will remember the intelligence limit in its position, if it was said: How is it correct and the Almighty said in Suraidah: It is forbidden for you to be the dead [3] Menuhakah, Al-Mawq and Al-Maradi, so this was indicated that it is not (P-14) who is the one who is a dead and from it that is not like that, we said: Perhaps it was in the matter of the matter.The language, and after the stability of the law, the dead is what we mentioned, and God knows.As for the purposes; Know that the mistake in the accounts that are attached to this verse from two voices: one of them: what they have left about the verse while it is within it.The second: What they entered into it while it is outside it.As for the first section, it is in the following: Malik said: It is forbidden for the benefit with its greatness in particular.The jurisprudence of jurisprudence agreed on the prohibition of the integrity with the hair of the pingling, and these things were carried out that these things are dead, so it is necessary for it to be forbidden.For him, peace be upon him: “What is clear from a neighborhood is dead.He revives the bones while it is a thief [Yass: 78] and she proves that she was alive, because the death is a dead man, and if it is proven that she is dead, he must be forbidden for the benefit of it.You have to be dead.The person who violates it was subjected to that poetry and wool have no life in it; Because the wisdom of life is awareness and feeling, and that is the aggravations of the poetry, and for the sake of this speech, your money went to the sides of the bones without the feeling.The answer is that life is not a phrase of the meaning that is for the awareness and feeling with the evidence of the verse and the news; As for the verse, it is said: How The land revives after its death [Al -Rum: 50].The language is not a phrase for what you mentioned, but rather from the time of the animal or the plant is correct in its moods, which are adjusted if it is not exposed to the corruption, and the one who is exhausted, and the one who is exhausted, and the one who is abusive, That is the appearance of its promotion under the verse.Abu Hanifa embarked on the Qur’an, the news, the consensus, and the measurement: the Qur’an said it to the Almighty: and from its homes, its homes, and its poems, furniture, and the goods of the time: [30] Mennah, and the two are not signed by the unconscious that is not permissible for him.As for the news, peace be upon him, in the sheep of Mimon, ““ He was forbidden from the dead.And on the authority of Al -Nakha’i: They were not seeing the stakes of the seventh and the death of the dead if it was tainted with a few, and they did not specialize in the state of the poetry and its numbers, and the saying of the Shafi’i: He says: Al -Thalab, with Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, is permissible, so this is what he says with his perpetrator; Because the intelligence is a condition of agreement, and it is not the same in this fox.As for the measurement, because this feeling and bones are bodies that are beneficial to them, so that it is not exposed to mourning and corruption.With the poetry of the pink: in jurisprudence, whoever prevents his impurity, which is the Islam, then they said: He endowed that the general saying of his saying: He was forbidden for you, And otherwise, this indicative is produced by the integrity with it, and the private is presented over the year, so this side was the first to raise it.* * * The advisor, may God be pleased with him, has a saying in little water, and they needed the advisors that they are animals, so if she dies, she becomes dead, then he will be forbidden, and he will be forbidden.Seek it with the necessity of the verse, the judgment is obligatory with its impurity, and if the judgment is established with its impurity, the ruling is obligatory with the impurity of the little water, which is the one who is in it, and it is the one who is in it.A dead person, and the intended is forbidden by it, but you did not say: Whenever it was like that, it was unclean, and then it was not necessary from its impurity, and the water was made by it, The companion, may God be pleased with him, has the words of peace be upon him: “If the flies fall into the vase Perhaps the food was hot, and the flies die in it, so if that was because of the captivity of the Tanjis, the Prophet, peace be upon him, would not have been commanded.* * * The third question: The jurisprudence is seven in the matter of tanning, so the people are wide in it, in which the Zahri said, so it is permissible to seek the sake Tanning, and David is followed, so he said: All of them are purified by tanning, and he will be blessed by your money.The skin of the pingling, and the Shafi’i is followed, so he said: Everyone is purified except the skin of the dogs and the pink, and the al -Awsa’i and Abu Thawar are followed, so they say: His flesh is only, and Ahmad ibn Hanbul, may God be pleased with them, follows him, so he said: Nothing is purified from it with tanning, and he transcends Ahmad, and the verse of the verse, The dead [Al -Ma’idah: 3] As for the news, Abdullah ibn Hakim said: The book of the Messenger of God ﷺ came before his death that you do not interact with the dead with fear or nervous The general person specialized in the news of the one and with the measles is permissible, and they found that we have told the one, so the prayer and peace be upon him: As for the measurement: it is that the tanning restores the skin to what was the state of life, and as the state of life was cleared, as well as after the tanning, and this is the measure and the news, they are the one who is not.* * * The following question: they disagreed that it is permissible for the benefit of the dead, with the food of the bazi and the Bahimah, for those who are prevented from it; Because if he fed the bastard, then he has benefited from that dead, and the verse is indicative of the prohibition of the benefit of the dead.Is it obligatory for us to prevent it or does it have to be involved.* * * Fifth question: They disappeared in the dead and dwelt of it.This is its condition, for the phenomenon requires the prohibition from it, and if it is not like that, it is outside the course of the dead.The Messenger ﷺ Makkah came to those who gathered the children, and they said: O Messenger of God, we are the gathering of the Idaaks and it is from the dead and others, but it is for the hand and the shed.God is forbidden to them, so they sold it, and they eaten it.It is forbidden to eat.* * * The sixth question: The phenomenon requires the prohibition of the thickness and the rituals, except that they were dedicated to the news of Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with him, and he said: Matthewat and dummy.The tahl and the life “and on the authority of Jabir in a long story: that the sea gave them a whale, so they eaten from it half a month, so when they returned, tell the Prophet and the Prophet He said: “Do you have anything from him?” And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in the semester of the sea: “It is the purification of its water.In the floating poison, which is died in the water, his nose, so Malik and Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with them, said: There is no good with him, and Abu Hanifah, the companions of the soul, said: His compassion, and the companions were different in this question, so he is upon me, may God be pleased with him, that he said: He did not stop from the navigation of the sea, so we do not eat it, and this is also from the father Bin Abd Allah, (P-16) was narrated from Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him and Abu Ayoub, his permissibility The prayers and peace be upon him, he said: “The sea did not throw or go away from it, and they entrust it, and what is died in it, so do not eat it.” As for Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, he was invoked by the verse, the news, and the mind: As for the verse, it was said by the highest: I am permissible for you the sailor of the sea, and this is the one who is the one who is The sea is obligatory.As for the news; So, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “We have the deadness of the thickness and the gears” and this is divorced, and it was said in the sea: It was narrated from Anas, may God be pleased with him, that he, peace and blessings be upon him.* * * The sword is: Al -Shafi’i and Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with them, said: No, I am not all in the food It was found dead, and it is not permissible, and as for what was taken alive, then his head was cut and he was eaten.The pilgrimage of the Malik of the Point of the Verse, the Hajj of the Shafi’i and the father of Hanifa, the saying of peace be upon him: So it is clear that he cut off his head if he made him a intelligence, so it is like the slave sheep that he is not dead, so he will not be the saying of God: Anecdotal "" "" "" And Abdullah bin Abi Awfi said: “I invaded with the Messenger of God ﷺ seven invasions.* * * The eighth question: they were disagreed in the gin if it comes out after the mother’s sacrifice, so Abu Hanifa said: It is not eaten except that he comes out with a neighborhood, and he said: Al -Shafi’i, Abu Yousf and Muhammad: He is eaten.This is the narrator on Ali, and a son Masoud, and Ibn Omar.Malik said: If he was created and his poetry has eaten, otherwise he is not eaten, and he is the saying of Said ibn Al -Masib.Abu Hanifa embarked on the back of this verse, which is that it is dead, so he must be forbidden.Al -Shafi’i said, this general is devoted to the news and the measurement.Imam, Kaab Bin Malik, Ibn Omar, Abu Ayoub, and Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with them, on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “ The intelligence is a reason for the pornography, so it is that the intelligence of the gin is a junior to obtain the intelligence of his mother.The Hanafis replied that his saying: “The intelligence of the jinn is the intelligence of his mother.His mother is dumped, and that he is not eaten by the intelligence, such as the Almighty saying: Heaven is bound by the heavens and the earth [Al -Imran: 133] and its meaning is like the offer of the heavens and the one who said: Your saying, and my mind is your mind, but the meaning: my saying is like your saying, and my time is like you The two imams are positive, and that it is not the same as the use of itself, and the other is that the intelligence of his mother is permissible for his eating, and if it is like that, it is not permissible.He carried it on the meaning of the verse.Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, answered from his faces: one of them: that the imams that you mentioned, it is necessary to in which it is necessary, which is that the intelligence of the genius is like the woman of the mother.And the second: that it is not called a gin except the state of his universe in the stomach of his mother, and when he is born, he is not called a ginger, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is the same, but he has proven to him.It is obligatory that (P-17) be in that state, consumed by its right to.And the third of it: that the carrying of the news about what you mentioned about the affairs of his diets if it comes out alive, its affiliation will fall; Because this is a knowledge before his roses.And he seized it: What was narrated from Abu Saeed is that he is peace and peace be upon him.As for the measurement, it is one of the faces: one of them: I have gathered us on the fact that those who were drained from his wife were died and died and thrown a year dead, and he did not separate the jinn, and we will not be separated by the jinn, The child is alive and then died, and he was separated by his soul without his mother in the affirmation of the jealous He came out in a neighborhood, and it was not eaten until it was stained.And the second: that the gin is the case of its connection to the mother in the ruling of a member of its members, so it is obligatory to replace her with the sales of the members of the members.And the third: the duty in the boy is to follow The mother is in the intelligence, as the mother follows the mother in emancipation, the method, and the writing and its part.* * * Because it is a dead, so it is obligatory to be forbidden, but we said: It is a dead; For the text and the mind, as for the text, it was said by prayer and peace: Because he realizes the pain and pleasure, and by the piece, that description remained dead, so he must be forbidden for his saying: The Almighty said: 3] * * * The most important question: they disagreed that the sacrifice of what is not eaten by his flesh, does the purity of the skin follow?So the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, does not follow him; Because this sacrifice does not follow the solution of the most, then it is obligatory that the purity is not pursued as the slaughter of the Mujoisi.And when Abi Hanifa follows him.* * * It requires the prohibition of what is died in it, but it is necessary to prohibit the eye of the dead, and what has been deceived by the dead, then it is not called a dead, so it does not take it to the sake of the time There is a mouse and died, because it does not take it, this phenomenon, and the total words in this section are revolving around two chapters: one of them: as for the one who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a man who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is the one who is the one who is a person He who does not impure it is not forbidden.The second: that the one who is unclean is how the way is to purify it?* * * The second question: He asked Abdullah ibn al -Mubarak Abu Hanifa on a slope that was located in a broken destiny and died, so Abu Hanifah said to his companions: So they remembered for him from Ibn Abbas: that the flesh eats after it washed and sheds the ritual, and Abu Hanifa said: This is what we say to it, if it is in it, if it is in it, if it is in it, if it is in it, if it is in it, if it is in it, if it is in it, if it is in it.This is the narration, even if it was located in the event of its exaggeration: neither meat nor the shed eaten, Ibn al -Mubarak said: And why is that?He said: Because if he fell into her in her boil, then he died inside the dead, and if it was signed in it, the state of its knocks is died, so the dead was nominated, and the mother said: Thirty: This is two buttons, in the paradise, meaning the gold, and the son of the blessed narrated, such as this about goodness.* * * It is removed from a dead chickens, and he knows that the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, does not hold in this matter with a vice version It is described as a dead, so it is obligatory for a negation and a deficiency in it Another indication, and Al-Shafi’i, if the milk was gathered in a vessel, then he fell in (P-18), something from the dead, then it is imprisoned, so if it dies, then if it dies, and it is in it.Burning, as for eggs, if it is brought out of the woven of the chicken, it is purified if it is washed, and its eaters are dissolved; Because the scales, if the stars are crucified between the eaten and between the dead, then it will be dissolved, and for that if you were the egg, it is not forbidden.* * * Let this chapter be sealed with the subscribers of the two divisions.The first question: The speakers differed that the dead is that it will be dead in the sense of death, so whoever has proven the death in the sense of the one who said: The death and life [King: 2] and among them who said: It is a life of life with what is in his matter to accept life, and this is close.The second question: They disagreed that the deadness of the dead requires its impurity, and the truth is that the prohibition of the benefit does not require the impurity; Because it is not possible in the mind to prohibit the integrity with it, and the integrity is permissible for what it has gave it, except that it has been proven by consensus that the dead is a success.* * * The second chapter is in the prohibition of blood, and it contains two issues of the first question: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him.Abu Hanifa said: The thickness is not forbidden.As for Al -Shafi’i, he is touched by the vice of this verse, and it is his saying: Rather, you have forbidden the dead and blood and the flesh of the ping Hold it with the words of the Almighty: Say: I do not find what was revealed to me, forbidden for a heal that he fits only to be dead or a blood that is shed.[Al -Anam: 145] One of these things is forbidden except for these things, for the blood that is not shed, and it must not be prohibited by the requirement of this verse.So this verse is in particular, and its saying: The dead and blood are forbidden for you, and the private is presented over the year, the Shafi’i answered, may God be pleased with him, that he said: I reveal to me a forbidden that does not have a sign of the solution of these things that are mentioned in this verse, but rather that it is what is clear to him, and this is not for him It is contrary to show him after that, it is forbidden for him, so perhaps he said to him: He was forbidden for you the dead It was shed or other than a slave, if this is proven, the judgment is obligatory with the sanctity of all the blood and its impurity, so the blood is removed from the mother, and what is in the mother, Water and dumping, as it is improvised by that.The second question: they were disagreed with his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: On them, then it will be a valid, or not?Some of them are prevented from that; Because the luxurious runs the gauge of flesh, as well as the spoiler, but it is described by that simply.And among them is those who say: It is like a rigid blood, and it is inferred from the hadith.* * * The third chapter in Khunzir has the first questions: (P-19) The great of the intelligence is attached to it, and it is like it: O you who believe if we would like to pray from the day of the Friday, so they will be removed from the remembrance The sale is forbidden when it was the greatest of the tasks with them, but the hair of the pink is unavoidable within the backs.Including it for the other, so Abu Hanifa and Muhammad said: It is permissible, and the Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, said: It is not permissible, and the father of Yusuf said: Abi Hanifa and Muhammad, that we see the Muslims who acknowledge the silence on his resignation from other than a nickname that appeared from them, and because the pilgrim is inspired by him, and if he said: The garment is implemented for the hardship of the bound, so it is permissible for the same in the hair of the pingling if it is sorted with it?* * * Eaten.The argument of Al -Shafi’i is the saying of the Almighty: I will be filled with you, the sailor and its food [Al -Ma’idah: 96] and the Hajj of Abu Hanifa is that this is a pink, and it is forbidden for you to say: The dead, the blood, and the flesh of the pingle [Al -Ma’idah: 3] Al -Shafi’i said: The pingling, if it is released, then it is replaced by the understanding of the righteousness, not the sake of the sea, as well as the sailor, as well as the sail To understand the flesh other than the thickness, not the flesh of the heaven in the horizons, and because the water of the water is not called a pink on release, but it is called the water of the water.* * * The third question: The Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said that he is washing the vessel from the loyalty of the Khuzir seven?One of it: Yes, you like it to the dog.The second: No; Because that tension was, but it was a fatwa for them from mixing the dogs, and they were not mixing with the pings, so the difference appeared.* * * The loyal chapter in the prohibition of what I have to be in the place of God is from the people who claimed that what is meant by that is the slander of the slave of the two who were the one who was sacrificed.His saying is the Almighty: And what was slaughtered on the text [Al -Ma’idah: 3] and they authorized the sacrifice of Al -Nasrani if ​​he is called in the name of the Christ, and it is a giving, and the good, The sinner.Malik, Al -Shafi’i, Abu Hanifa, and his companions said: It is not permissible.And the argument is that if they are slaughtered At the name of Christ, they have lost it to him for the other hand, so he must be forbidden.It was narrated on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, that he said: If you hear the Jews and the Christians, they will be exhausted for the other They are their slaughter, and he knows what they say.The violator was involved in Jajah: The first: that he said: The food of those who gave the book a solution for you [Al -Ma’idah: 5] and this is general.The second: that he said: He did not slaughter on the text, and it was referred to that what is meant by saying it: and what he has to do with others is what is meant by saying: The third: that the Nasrani, if God is called, is the Almighty, but he wants the Christ, then if his will is for that, then you will not prevent the dissolution of his sacrifice with him, for the sake It is noteworthy that his ruling will be if he appears to be guaranteed when God's remembrance and his Christ.The answer to the first: that his saying: the food of those who have given the book a solution for you in general and its saying: What I have for it is for others in particular and the private is presented to the public.And on the authority of Al -Thani: that his saying: And what is slaughtered on the monument does not require the disclosure of his saying: And what I have for it is for the other than God because they are two things that are not.I only assigned us to the back, not in the interior.* * * (P-20) The fifth chapter, who say that the word “is“ for the confined to the confined that the appearance of the verse is that it does not prohibit only these things, for us to know.Things of the last one of the forbidden women, so the word “is“ the phenomenon of the phenomenon in the work and whoever says that it does not benefit the exclusivity, for the forms are virtuous.* * * The sixth chapter in the obligatory and in which there are issues: the first question: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: He said to him: So whoever is forced to do so, whoever is not obligatory It is not a description of the thief of the prostitute, nor in the description of the aggression, so eat, so do not sin against it, and Abu Hanifa said: It is not for him, so he is forced to eat He sinned against him, so he dedicated to the adjective of the prostitute and the aggression by eating.And this disagreement is separated that the sinner, with his travel, does it take place or not?Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: He does not license; Because it is described by the aggression, so it does not exist under the verse, and Abu Hanifa said: Rather, he will be licensed; Because he is obligated to be not hateful and no return in the most, so he will be shown under the verse.Al -Shafi’i embarked on his saying of this verse and with the mind.As for the verse, it is that it is their pursuit and the exaltation of these things for all of it by saying: the dead and blood are forbidden for you [Al -Ma’idah: 3] Then they permitted it to the one who is obligated Because it is not a habit and no return, and the disobedience with his travel is not described in this row; Because our saying: So, so that we are not interested in our saying: So, so that it is prepared, and it is sufficient in his sincerity as his being, in order to be in a matter of things, or in the matter, or in the matter, or in the affairs, or in the affairs, or in the affairs, or in the affairs, or in the affairs, or in the affairs, or in the affairs of the affairs, or in the affairs of the affairs, or in the affairs of the affairs, or in the affairs of the affairs, Or otherwise, and if the name of the transgressor is true to his being, who is transcendent in something, any matter is, then we must be our saying: So that there is no one who does not believe, and it is not true that he does not believe that he does not believe.Something of bitter things, then our saying: it is not a habit or a return that does not believe unless it is fulfilled by the adjective of the transgression from all the faces.And the disobedience, with his travel, is prepared with his travel, so he does not believe his being, and if he does not believe in him, his hatred is upon him, and he said: You have to die and blood is the best in the chapter to say: This is formed by the hunger in his travel, for he is licensed with it that he is elaborate with the aggression, but it is a year.Specialization in this image, and the difference between the two pictures, that the privilege is a support on the travel, then if the travel is a disobedience, the license is a support for the sake of the disobedience.The travel in itself is a disobedience, and it was not a support for it on disobedience, so the difference appeared, and he knew that the judge and Abu Bakr al -Razi said that he said that he said: His saying: It is not a wig, and no one is back on the imam of the Muslims, and it is not returned that he would not be traveling in a disobedience, then they said: The interpretation of the verse is other than the one who is not in the abundance of what is not in the abundance of the abundance of the verse, and it is not in the abundance Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, and that is because his saying: it is not a habit or a condition, and the condition is in the house With a remembrance, and we have taught us that there is no male except for the elderly; Because we have indicated that the meaning of the verse: Whoever is forced, then he will eat otherwise, and no return, then do not sin against it, and if it is like that, it must be attached The travel that is the bit is not mentioned.He knew that this words are weak, and that is because we have shown that his saying: it is not a distress and no return does not believe unless the prostitute and the aggression are in all of the affairs, so the person is in all matters With a sacrifice.We do not say: The memorization is indicated by the two awareness, and it is specialized in eating, so it is a specialization from other than the harm, so it was on the disagreement of the original, then the one who is not.He shrouded him to the most hein: one of them: that his saying: it is not a habit and no one is a state It was intended to be unaware, and it is not like it, as well as in the largest, so it is impossible to remain in the description of the persecutions with him; Because the state of the most remains remains and described the persecution.And the second: that the human being repels his pride from the deadness The condition for the transgression in the greatest comes out of the word.And the third of it: that it is not a bag, and no one will benefit the negation of what the prostitute is and the negation of what is the aggression, and this is what is, but it is fulfilled by the one who is in the past, The greatest is one of the individuals of this essence, as well as the aggression in the travel is another individual of its individuals, then the denial of the aggression requires the negation of the aggression from all this Specialize it with eating is not permissible.As for Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, he does not devote him to the exile of the aggression in traveling, but he carries it on his appearance, and it is the negation Densing the aggression in the travel, and then it will be achieved.And the one who is seen: that the impersonation that we mentioned is an end to another verse, which is the saying of the Almighty: Whoever is forced in a fifted, other than the one who is in ourselves: It requires that it is not a wise man and the aggression in an affairs.And the father of Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, was invoked by his faces: one of them: His exalted say in another verse: He has concluded for you what he forbade you, except for what you have forced to do: He is obliged, so he should be cleared.And the second: His Excellency said: Do not kill yourself, God was merciful to you [Women: 29] and he said: Do not cast your hands to the reassurance [Al -Baqarah: 195] and abstain And the meeting of the soul in consumption, so it is obligatory to prohibit.And the third of it: It was narrated that peace be upon him, who was licensed for the resident one day and night, and for the traveler for three days and for them, and it was not separated from it between the disobedience and the mutihad.And he pushed it: that the sinner is traveling, if he is asleep, then he honored a fine or a burning that is obligatory for the present who is in the prayer that he cuts his prayers for the sake of the sacrifice.Because in this picture, he must seek to save the glow.Fifth: that the causes of destruction are pushed, such as the elephant, the camel, the living, the neighborhood, and the relative, but it is obligatory for it, so it is so.And its sixth: that the sinner with his travel, if he is forced, then if a man permitted him something of his money, then he will be permissible for him, but he must be upon him, so he is so, so we are.And its sake: that the one in the payment of the harm of the people is greater in the garment of everything that drives the woman from harming himself He was disobedient.And eighth: that the deportation will be permissible to take over the food of others without consent, but rather on the path of oppression, and this transformer is forbidden, if not for the persecution, so so.Al -Shafi’i answered the assignment of the generalities that our exile is the delicate of the licensed evidence, and the private is presented to the year, and from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the year The connection to this license With repentance, and if he does not repent, the side is on himself, then he knows this face with a strong face, which is that the license is a support on the travel, so if it is the travel, then it was Summary is an insult to disobedience and that is referred, because disobedience is varied from it, and the insistence is to seek to get it, and the collection between them is contradictory and the knowledge.* * * The second question: Al-Shafi’i, Abu Hanifa and his companions said: The obligatory person does not eat from the dead except for what he is touched by his thief (P-22) and said: He eats from what fills his hunger, and from Malik: he eats from it until he saves and supplied, so if he finds a richness for her, it will be given to her, and the closeness is in the significance of the verse.Because because of the privilege, if the abandonment, when the abandonment raised, the privatization has increased, as if the halal did not find it, it was not permissible for him to take the dead to the time To the existence of the permissible, so if the persecutions are still in eating destiny of it, then the well -being is forbidden, and I do not adopt in that as a link of the sect to what Al -Anbiri said; Because the pious in the appetite does not praise the eating of the dead if it is not hurt by leaving it, then it is here, and it is indicated by it, too It is not permissible for him to take care of the dead, so if that food eats and the fear of the wrapping is not permissible, it is not permissible for him to eat the dead.Al -Durar must prohibit the most after that.* * * The third question: they disappeared in the obligatory if he finds all the prohibited women, so the most of the scholars are good among all; Because the dead and blood and the flesh of the pinging are both in the prohibition and the persecution, then it is necessary to be a choice in all of it, and this is the one who lives with the dignity of this is the one who says: The death of the dead without the meat of the pingling is the greatest thing in the prohibition.* * * The following question: they disagreed with the obligatory to drink if it finds a wine, or whoever is grown with a bit, then he did not find water that he would like and find the wine, so whoever is from it, so whoever is the one who is good for them The image, for God is exalted, but this deprived of the souls of the soul and the payment of the people of it, so that is in this picture, and this is the closeness, and it is the closeness, and it is Bin Jabir and Abu Hanifa.Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: He does not drink; Because he increases his thirst and hunger, and his mind goes away.It is answered by his saying: He does not increase it except thirst and hunger with perseverance, and his saying: He removes the mind, our words in the few who are not like that.* * * Fifth question: They disagreed if the dead needed to take it to treat, either by its rises or by its struggle in some of the paths of the richness, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same.And the meaning; As for the text, it is permissible For the two people, the elders of the camels and their sons are drinking for the length of the people To say the Almighty: The goods are permissible for you [Al -Ma’idah: 4] The end of what is in the door is that this general is special, but it is not praised in his quantity.The second: that Abu Hanifa, when he pardoned the dirham from the impurity for the sake of the need, and the presidency, forgive the blood of the ritual for the need.For need?.The third: It is the highest that permitted the food of the soul of the soul, so it is all of us, and from the people who forbade it and the one who said it, peace be upon him: While he forbade them, "and the first answered that he was committed to this news, but it is fulfilled, even if it is proven that he is forbidden by him, and the conflict is not.* * * The sixth question: they disagreed in the circulation of wine, and know that the need for that handling if it ends up to the limit It did not end up to the limit of the deportation, so its judgment was presented in the fifth question.
