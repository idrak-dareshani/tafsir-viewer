The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty, and when we took your covenant and raised us, then the phase, take what we have brought with strength, and remember what is in it, so that you will fear, then you will fear then The best of God is upon you and his mercy, because you were among the losers.Ali: As for his saying, the Almighty: And when we take your covenant, then he will be in the end: the first: know that the covenant is that it is the verb of the things that are required.And the interpreters mentioned in the interpretation of the covenant and its faces: one of them: what God called the minds of the evidence indicating the provision of the chants and the ruling of the evidence of the evidence of the evidence His prophets and messengers, and this type is one of the strongest events and the righteousness because it does not bear the backwardness and the way of the face of the dead, which is the saying of the deaf.The second: What was narrated from Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is that Moses, peace be upon him, when he returned from his Lord in the eyes, he said to them: “There is no book” By saying that we see God as a wicker, and he says: This is my book, so they took it, so I took them to the thunder He raised them above them, and they were told: Take the book, or we will be blessed with you, so take it.The raising of the phase is the covenant, and that is because raising the phase is a splendid, wondrous verse that shows the minds and returns the liar to the belief and the complainant to the two of you And they recognized that he was a knowledge of peace be upon him, with the knowledge of peace be upon him, in addition to the path of the verses.To what was among them from the worship of the calf and that they would perform a conversation, then this was a documented covenant, making it to God for themselves, and this is the choice of my father.And the third of it: that God has two charters, for the first: when he was brought out from the heart of Adam and I testify to themselves.The second: It is obligatory to follow the followers of the prophets and what is this is the covenant.This is the saying of Ibn Abbas and he is weak.Al -Thani: Al -Qafil, may God have mercy on him, said: Rather, he said: Your covenants and did not say your events for two guys: It brings you a hole [Ghaffir: 67], that is, each of you.The second: It was one thing that was taken from each one of them, as it was taken otherwise, so it was not a crime, all of which was one of the covenant, and if it was said that your events were said to be I was taken to them, not one of the one charter, and God knows.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: We raised us, and the phase is your perception, so hisor said: “And when we fear the mountains, according to them, as if it is a shadow [Al -Arafah: 171] The first: Al -Waw in his saying: We raised us Or a kindness on the interpretation of Ibn Abbas, and the meaning is to take (P-100) the charter was stated, so when we gave it to him by abstaining from the acceptance of the book, they are raised by the book The interpretation of my father is a Muslim, so it is not a kindness, but it is, or the situation, as it is said: I did that and the time is time, so he said: And when we took us, then we have taken you.The second: It was said: The phase is every mountain.Al -Ajej said: I will give him his wings from the phase, so he passed the bazi, if the biz is broken, as for the immortality, he said in his book: The phase is the name of a known mountain, and this is the closeness of the It is necessary to carry it on a mountain with a grace that is known as its name, which is called this name, and the bodies are the mountain that the survivor has come to him, and they have come to him.So he makes it by them, even if it is far from them, because the righteousness is to relieve the mountains in the air, as well as it is also to take it off and transfer it to them, and he said to them, and he said: A mountain from the mountains of Setsin, and he was then swallowed from his origin until he rose up like the shadow, and he was the masters of a firmness in a firm, so God revealed to them that they are.The mountain is upon you, and when they saw that there was no Arab, they accepted the teeth in what was in it and they found for the fear of prostration, and they observed the mountains, so that they found a prostration.The third: It is from the one who denies the possibility of the rituals of the heroic in the air without a baptism, and the earth said, but it stopped because it is a picker for the sake of the time, and it is not the same.And our evidence for the corruption of their saying is that it is granted by all the possibilities and the ease of the trustworthy in the air from the possibilities, so it is necessary for God to be, and God is forbidden, and it is forbidden.The two introduces are known in the books of origins.The fourth: Some of them said: The shadow of the mountain is not permissible, because that if he had fallen, he would run the course of the abandonment to faith, and he contradicts the cost.The judge replied that he does not refer to that the most of the fear of the stallion is upon them, so if it is dominated in its place for a period of time, and they have witnessed the heavens, so it is not a good way Fear disappears from them, and the abandonment goes away and the cost remains.As for his words of exalted: Take what we have brought to you with strength, that is, a complete, determined, and domesticated determination, and the horsemen, the Jubaiyeh said: This indicates that the one is the one.Because it is not permissible to say: Take this with strength and no power, as it is not said: Written by the pen and no pen, and our companions answered that the meant The determination may be advanced by the verb.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Remember what is in it, that is, keep what is in the book and study it and do not forget it and do not forgive it.If it was said: Did you carry it on the same remembrance?We said: Because the remembrance that is Against the forgetfulness of the act of God, so how is it permissible for him.But if we carry it on the running, then there is no form.As for his words, the Exalted: Perhaps you will fear that you will fear, and the Jaba’i began with that on that he wanted to do the obedience of all, and his answer.He knew that the concept is from his saying: And when we took your covenant and raised us, then the phase is taken.For the charter, and it is not true after: then you took over, and that was rented from them on acceptance and commitment.As for his words, the Almighty: Then you took care of that after that, then you exposed the covenant and the sufficiency of it.And raised the phase, they took away from the teeth with many matters, so they cited the teeth, left the work with it, killing the prophets, and disbelieved in them and disbelieved in it, and they did not.Some of them are without some, and among them what they did, and what he did to delay them, and they did not go to the end with their views of the wings of nights, night and day, and they will be disbelieved.And they throw it with all the harm, and they are directed to the sins in their affliction, that until it was lost with some of them, and the fire was burned, and the fire is so much, In the delay of the deeds that they acknowledge, then he did not delay them, what is not hidden from it until they were neglected by the abandonment of the house of the sanctuary, and they disbelieved.And the Qur’an, and if there is no way in it, what they have taken over from the deeds, then the sentence is known, and that is a news from God, who is up to the stubbornness The peace and blessings of peace be upon him from the book and their unjust for its right and their condition in their writers and their prophets what was mentioned, and God knows best.As for his words, the Almighty: If not the best of God is upon you and his mercy, you were among the losers, so he will come to him: the first: the locking of the lock in the lock of it: God preferred with you from you from your glory and delaying the torment of you, so that you were among the losers, that is, from the wanders who have sold themselves with the light of Hell They came out of this loss, because God Almighty preferred them to be aware of them until they repented.The second: that the news is that it has ended with his words, the Almighty: Then you took care of after that, then it was said: If not the best of God, and the mercy of God, and the mercy of God, and may God bless you If not for God, I would have looked at you by lifting the mountain, so you would have been blessed with your response, but it is preferred to you and your mercy, so you will be blessed with you.The second research: that there is a saying to say: a word, if not to benefit the thing, the thing is to be proven otherwise, so it is required that the loss of the loss is from the righteousness So where The losses obtained, and there is no excessive kindness of God.This requires that God Almighty did not do anything from the religious kindness, and that is the difference of the saying of the disgrace.Al -Kaabi answered that he was up to everyone in the grace, but some of them benefited without one, so it was correct that it is said that as he said to the one who said to the one who said to the one who said to the one who said to the one who said to the one who said to a man The giving, so he took advantage of them: If not for your father, you would have been a poor, and this answer is weak because the people of the language are stipulated that: “If only“ Other than that, then this is the way of the cake, the words of the Kaabi are very fallen.
