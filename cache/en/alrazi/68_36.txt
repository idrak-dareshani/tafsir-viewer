The Quranic researcher is that God has answered this speech by saying: So make the Muslims like the criminals, what you have, how do you judge, and the meaning of the words is that Equipped, and in the verse.The first question: The judge said: There is a clear indication that the human being described as a Muslim and a criminal like the opponent, so the immoral is when it was a criminal, it is not necessary that he is not a Muslim, and the answer is that He denied making the Muslim a proverb for the crime, and there is no doubt that what is meant is not the denial of the same in all things, so they are similar in the Jawar and al -Jashar And the animal, and others of the many things, but what is meant by the denials of their equality in Islam and the crime, or in the effects of these two things, or what is meant is the denial of the effect of Islam To the influence of the crime of the crime with God, and this is a Muslim in which there is no conflict in it.The second question: Al -Jubai said: The verse indicated that the crime is not a girl in Paradise; Because it was the highest of the crops between them, and if they were obtained in paradise, the level of which was brought between them in the reward, but perhaps the reward of the reward is the reward of the reward The Muslim, if the criminal is the longest of the age of the Muslim, and his obedience was unaware.Answer: This is weak; Because we have indicated that the verse is not prevented from collecting leveling in something in the first place, but it is prevented from collecting leveling in the path of reward, and perhaps they are equal in it The Muslim who did not disobey more than the reward of those who disobeyed, that we say: Why is it not permissible for what is meant by the criminals are the disbelievers who have told them The fall, and that is because the holding of the local collection with the thousand and the blame on the previous bodies is famous in the language and the knowledge.The third question: that God is the highest, denying the settlement between the Muslims and the criminals in the reward, so this indicates that it is the sake of the mind of the mind That the infidels enter Paradise and those who are obedient in the fire and the answer: that it is the highest, denying that with the judgment of the best and the goodness, not that, because one of it.And know that he was upset when he said on the path of the repetition: I will make the Muslims like the criminals.You judge this woven judgment.* * * Then he said: A mother has a book in which you study, for you have no choice, and it is like his saying: a mother who has a sultan, so that you will come to you (156) You study that you do not choose that because he is a teachings, when the mother came, she was broken, and the thing was chosen and his choice, that is, he took his goodness, and he took it And he used it if he takes his climate.
