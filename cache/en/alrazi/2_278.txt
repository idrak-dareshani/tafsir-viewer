The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: O you who believe, fear God and infer what remains of usury if you are believers For you are the heads of your money, do not oppress and do not oppress, and if it is difficult, look at a facilitator, and that you believe that if you know, and you will know, and you will not know.And God then passes away every soul that has been caused while they are not wronged in the verse: The first question: Know that he is up to what he explained in the verse that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been in the verse that is not from A predecessor, it was permissible to think that there is no difference between the conquest of it and between the rest of the people in the dhimma He was on them and did not hold, for the leadership was prohibited, and they have nothing to take except the heads of their money, but rather the exaggeration in that; Because whoever is waiting for a long period of time in the lofty solutions, then the time was attended and he thought that he had the same time.Great, and he said: Fear God and fear what he forbids and prevented what remained of usury means if you have seized anything, then they will not be pardoned, and if he did not Some of him, that is the one who did not hold it, both or some, so it is forbidden to hold it.And know that this verse is a great origin in the rulings of the disbelievers if they are Muslim, and that is because what has passed in the time of the infidels is that it remains and does not arise, and it is not spared, His judgment is ahead of Islam.He has passed, and if you did not hold it, it has a skillful like it without the skilled skilled.This is the gold of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him.If it was said: How did he say: O you who believe, fear, then he said at the end of it if you are believers?Answer: From his faces: The first: that this is the same as what is said: If you are a brother, then be sure of me, meaning: whoever was a brother who honored his brother.The second: It was said: It is meaning if you are believers before him.The third: If you want to sustain the judgment for you with faith.The lord: O you who believe in their tongues, they are the same as the usurc.If you are believers in your hearts.The second question: In the reasoning of the revelation of the verse, the narratives: (P-87) The first novel: It is a speech for the people of Mecca, who were raised, and when they greeted them, then they are the one who did not It is up to take the heads of their money without the increase.And the second novel: A fighter said: The verse was descended in four brothers from a ritual: Masoud, Abdullah Yalil, Habib, and Rabiah, Bani Amr ibn Amir They guided the children of the deceased, so when The Prophet ﷺ appeared on the sect, the Muslim of the brother, and then they demanded that they be the children of the deceased, so God Almighty revealed this verse.And the third novel: it came down in Al -Abbas, and Uthaman ibn Afan, may God be pleased with them, and they were a lineage in the dates, so when he attended the gunfire, then he was in the past, and he increased the rest of the This is the saying of giving and honor.The loyal novel: It was descended in Al -Abbas and Khalid Bin Al -Widaid, and they were shed in usury, and he is the saying of Al -Saddi.The third question: The judge said: His saying: If you are believers, like the evidence that faith does not exist if the human being is overburdened, but it becomes a believer if he is a believer.Blacks.The answer: When the many evidences are mentioned in the interpretation of its saying: Those who believe in the unseen that the work is outside the name of the faith of the faith, which was the name of the faith.On the fullness of faith and its parts, then the estimation was: If you are workers with the requirement of the law of faith.This is, even if it is leaving for the back, but we went to him for the evidence.* * * Then he said: “If you do not do, then give permission to a war of God and His Messenger, and in which there are books: the first question: Read Asim and Hamza (so the one) Mamddida, the crushing of the one, for example (safe), and the rest, so let them be a silence of the darkening of the worse, and it is narrated from the Prophet, and it was narrated from the Prophet.On the authority of him, they have read (so they are ears) The verse, and the appreciation: So know who did not give up on the usury with a war of God and His Messenger, and if they are commanded by the flags other than them, then they have not been aware of that Their knowledge is a sign of the flags other than them, so this is the reading in the rhetoric, and Ahmad ibn Yahya said: The readers of the public are from the ears, meaning that they are the knowledge (So ​​be certain), which is an indication of the public rule.The second question: They disagreed that the speech is by saying it, then you did not do, then give permission to a war of God, a speech with the believers, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one With the infidels who are desirable for rabies, those who said, but the sale is like usury, the judge said: The first imitator is the first; Because he said: So they said a speech with a people who submit their remembrance, and they are addressing with his saying: O you who believe, fear God, and those who are lost, On the discourse with the believers.If it was said: How did he command the warning with the Muslims?We said: This is the memorial, it is called the one who has disobeyed God, and it is not desirable, as it came in the news.He did not invite the hidden, so it is permissible for a war of God and His Messenger.He has made many of the interpreters and jurisprudence his saying: Rather, the penalty of those who fight God and His Messenger [Al-Maaidah: 33] originally in Qutta (P-88) The Muslims, so it was proven that the remembrance of this type is from the threat with the Muslims and a response in the book of God and in the Sunnah of his Messenger.If you know this, then we say: In the answer to the remote question, the first: the first: the intended thing in the threat without the same war, and the second: the intention is the same Displacement, so we say: the righteousness of the deeds of usury, if it is from a person, and the imam was destined to arrest him and run in it the ruling of God from the conjugation, until the time of the ritual And if he sits from whom he will have a disorder and a thunderbolt, the imam fought him as he fights the prostitute category, and when the father of Bakr, may God be pleased with him, fought, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good Leave the call to prayer, and the burial of the death of the dead, for he does what we mentioned, and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: Whoever treats the god is a success, then he will be repent.And the second saying: In this verse, it is saying: If you do not do, then give permission, a speech for the atone Affiliated with the prohibition of usury, then if you do not do any, then if you do not be a well -being of his prohibition, then then give permission to the sake of God, and from God, and from God, and from God, and whoever is a mess.There is an indication that those who disbelieved in one project of Islam were disbelieving, as he disbelieved in all his parts.* * * Then the Almighty said: And if you pass and the meaning on the first saying, you will be made from the treatment of usury, and on the second saying of the sorrow of usury, then you are the heads of your mother, and you will not be darkened.You shadow the deceased by demanding the increase in the head of money, and do not oppress any minimal money.
