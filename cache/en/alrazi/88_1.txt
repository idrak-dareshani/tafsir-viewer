The Quranic researcher (P-137) Surah Al-Ghaffiya, which is ten and six verses, is an angel ﷽ Is it the hadith of the ghusid The faces of a humiliating day, a long -standing act, know that in his saying: Do you come to the hadeeth of the raid His saying: The day the torment is covered [the spider: 55] Rather, the resurrection was called by this name, because what was surrounded by the shoes of all its bodies, so it is a ram of it, and it is for it, and it is the one who has a brutal for it, The first: that it returns to creation, and it is like the Almighty saying: I believe that you will bring them a feud of the torment of God [Joseph: 107].The second: that it fades all the first and the others.The third: that it fades the people with the horrors and the hardships.The second saying: The fraud is the fire, that is, the faces of the disbelief and the people of the fire are faded, and the heavens of the fire.Jabir and fighting.The third saying: The fresher, the people of the fire, are cheating on it and falling into it, and the first is close, because on this estimation it becomes the meaning that the day of the resurrection is in the day of the resurrection.And some of them are in happiness.The second question: Rather, he said: Did he come to you and that because he is the highest of the Messenger of God from its condition and the condition of the people in it is not what he was nor his people, he is a disobedience to him It indicates that it only indicates that the state of the disobedience is contrary to the state of the obedient.As for how this conquest is not a reason for the mind to it, when God introduced him to detailing those conditions, there is no crime he said: Do you come to the hadith of the gash?As for the saying of the Exalted: The faces of a humiliating day are an action, and I know that it is a description of the people of the slander, and there are two issues: the first question: the first question: And they are the infidels, with an indication that it is the same and the description of the faces is that it is (P-138), and it is a bounced, and it is a bound, and that is one of the attributes of the cost, but the righteousness is in the face of it.That is, and it is like it: it is the faces of the day, the day, the resurrection [Resurrection: 22].And his saying: A humble, that is: the dementia of the camers of the shame and the love, as he said: If you see when the criminals are their heads of their heads [Al -Sajdah: 12] and he said: And he sees them.From humiliation, they look at a hidden orientation [Al -Shura: 41], but the humiliation appears in the face, because it is against the arrogance with which the head of the head and the brain.As for the worker, it does the work, and the meaning of the monument: the diligent in the work with tiredness.المَسْألَةُ الثّانِيَةُ: الوُجُوهُ المُمْكِنَةُ في هَذِهِ الصِّفاتِ الثَّلاثَةِ لا تَزِيدُ عَلى ثَلاثَةٍ, لِأنَّهُ إمّا أنْ يُقالَ: هَذِهِ الصِّفاتُ بِأسْرِها حاصِلَةٌ في الآخِرَةِ, أوْ هي بِأسْرِها حاصِلَةٌ في The world, or some of it in the last and some of it in the world.As for the first direction: It is It is with her families to be seized in the last, so it is that the infidels are the day of the resurrection, who are humbled, that is, who are not humiliated, and that is because they are in the world, and it is more than what God has grown up The fire is a work that is tired in it, and it is the richness of the wealthy and the ethical yields, according to what he said: In a seed of seven seven arm [Al -Haqa: 32] and its murder in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as it is in the fire as the fire is as it As you are righteous from it, it is divided into it, and the inhalation in the free hell and the dignity is naked, with a hungry, thirsty in the hills before the entry of the fire in A thousand years, and persevere because they are always in that work.Al -Hassan said: These attributes had to be in the world for the sake of the sake of God, for the sake of God, for the sake of God Also, God blessed her on the day of resurrection on the path of punishment.As for the second direction: that it is with its families, it is in the world, it was said: They are the companions of the fasting from the Jews, the Christians, and the slave of the two and the mummy, and the meaning is that it is shivered and did not Her work is from the permanent fasting and the stained glorification, and that is because they did not hide in God what he did not fit with, as if they obeyed a self -made self in the end of them The truth is what they worshiped, but they worshiped that imagined, who is not available to him, so there is no crime that does not benefit that worship in the first place.As for the third face: that some of these attributes are in the hereafter and some of them in the world, then they are faced with it: one of them: that it is humbled in the hereafter, with the end of the world, with the end of it.The meaning is that it did not benefit from its work and its position in the world, and it is not forbidden to describe them with some descriptions of the hereafter, then it is reminded of some of the descriptions of the world, then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same In that concept, as if he said: He said: The face of the day of resurrection is humbled, because it was in the world a factor that is not in the obedience of God, then it is a fire.Second: It is a humble in the world, but it is anchor in the hereafter, so its fear in the world is its claim of its call to the symptoms of the unjust, the one who does it, and its prayers, and the goodness of it.And its installation in the hereafter is the hardness of the torment on what the Almighty said: It seemed to them from God, and they did not seek to be seen [Al -Zumar: 47] and read “a backering worker” And he described them with these three characteristics, after that, how their place, their drink, and their feeders, we seek refuge in God from it.
