and he said: The dye of God, then in the verse, the first question: The garment is dyed with the opening of the B and broken and broken three languages, dying with the opening of the hunter and breaking its two languages.And the dye: a verb of dye like a sitting from Jalis, which is the case that the dye falls on, then they disagreed with the meantic of the sacrifice of God on the words of God: the first of God: It was not called the religion of God, as one of them: some of the Christians were clinging to their children in a yellow water that they called the baptism and say: And if the one did with his son, he said: Now he has become a victory.And God Almighty said: Ask the dye of God, which is the religion, and Islam is not their dye, and the reason for the release of the dye of

them with generosity: I amg They are mocked by them [Al-Qar: 15, 14], they deceive God and he deceived them [the women: (P-79) 142], and they are depleted and the deceased of God [Al-Amran: 54], and the reward of a bad thing.[Shura: 40], If you make fun of us, then we are harnessed from you [Hood: 38].And secondly: Jews are dying of their children, and the Christians are dying of their children, in a sense that they will throw them, and they are dyed with that of what they drink in their hearts, and they said: Al -Anbari: It is said: So that so and so in the thing, that is, he enters it in it and is obligated to it as it is made the dye to be obligatory for the garment and shed a fool: The survivor is embarrassed if you do not want you in evil, and the third is: the religion was called a dye because it is a prestige that appears in the witness, who is the one who has the effect of the one who has the effect of the prayer, and he said: Their faces are from the effect of prostration [Al -Fateh: 29].And its elevation: The judge said his saying: The dye of God is attached to his saying: Say: We believe in God to his saying: And we have a Muslim who is a Muslim who is a peace God Almighty shows that the adornment between this religion that God has chosen, and between the religion that was chosen by the abundant phenomenon, as it appears, as it appears For the good sense.The second saying: that the dye of God is his innocence, and he is like his saying: the innocence of God, which the people of the people have been broken upon, and do not turn to the creation of God [the Romans]: 30] Motums in his installation and structures with miracle and horizons, and the witnesses are upon him With edge and limitation to the Creator, these monuments are like a dye for him and the unparalleled sequence.The judge said: Whoever carries his saying: the dye of God on the fast, then it is close in the meaning, because the saying of those who say: He is the religion of God, because

debt and a world like a prestige To say whoever says: only that is a neighboring return for Jews and the Christians in a dye that they can use in their children, because the words if he is a righteousness of the one who is righteous In it, and we will now remember the rest of the sayings of the interpreters: the third saying: that the dye of God is the betrayal, which is purification, that is, as is the one who is the one who is the one who is Cleaning to them, as well as the betrayal of the Muslims who are Muslim.The righteous saying: It is the Hajj of God, on the authority of the Deaf, and it was said: He is the Sunnah of God, on the authority of Abu Ubaydah, and the good saying is the first, and God knows.The second question: in the text of the “dye” sayings: one of them: that it is an extension of “mortar” and an interpretation of it.The second: Follow the dye of God.The third: Sibuyeh said: It is a confirmed source, so he will be on the authority of his saying: We believed in God as he affected and counts God.As for his saying: Whoever is good from God is a dye, it is what is meant that he is dying of his servants with faith and purifies them from the dirty disbelief, so there is no stain of the sake of his prestige.As for his saying, “We are worshiped for him, and the owner of“ Al -Kushf ”said: He is a kind of kindness on: Abraham, or we are in the sense of the dye of God, because it is in the dismantling of the systems, and it is an affirmative source that it is a certain source, which is the one who mentioned it.Whale
