The researcher, the Almighty, says: They ask you what they spend, say what you have spent for the best, for the religion, the closest, the orphans, the poor and the son of the way, and what you do for the good Glory be to him and the exalted when he wanted to be in Bayan that it is obligatory for every cost to be exposed to the request of the urgent, and that it is an accusative of the request of the later, and that it is the right of the lap, and that it will be in the right of the lap, and that it will be That was launched after that in the two rulings, and it is from this verse to his saying: Did you not see to those who came out of their path [the cow: 243] because from the habit The neutrality, the excess and the advice, and the two rulings are mixed with each other; Let each one of them be tense for the other and affirming it.The first judgment, while it is attached to the hypocrisy, is this verse, and it contains questions: the first question: Ata said about Ibn Abbas: This is the one who is in this verse.Prayer and peace, he said: I have a dinar.He said: I have four.Al -Kalbi narrated from Ibn Abbas that the verse was descended in Amr ibn al -Jamouh, and it was a great sheikh, and he was the one who was killed on the day of one, and he said: Our mother and where do we put it?This verse was revealed.* * * To him that the Arabs say: What do you ask?With the afflictions of the thousand in (what), if it was not (P-21) that (what) is with (who) with a single name, they said: What do you ask?By deleting the thousand as they deleted it from the words of the Almighty: when they wonder [the news: 1] and his saying: that you are from its remembrance [the disputes: 43], so what is the one who did not.(What) I knew that it is with (the) with a single name, and they did not delete the thousand of it when it was not the last name, and the deletion is attached to it if it is another Like his saying: “No, a deem, like a chicken, is empty in Ramad and the second saying: to make (who) in the sense of the one who is (what) is a lifetime.” And the Arabs may work (who) in the sense of the one who says: Who does that say that?أيْ مَن ذا الَّذِي يَقُولُ ذاكَ, فَعَلى هَذا يَكُونُ تَقْدِيرُ الآيَةِ: يَسْألُونَكَ ما الَّذِي يُنْفِقُونَ.* * * The third question: in the verse a question, which is that the people were asked what they spend, not those who spend the time to them, so how did he answer them?The answer to it is from his face It will be an answer to the question, and it has an increase in it, which is completed by that intended; That is because his saying: What you have agreed from the best of answers to the question, then that spending is not complementary unless it is located to the side I add it to the remembrance of the bank.And the second: Al -Qafal said: If the question is and he responds with the word (what) except that the intended: the question about the Kayafiyyah; Because they were a scientist that the one who passed through the spending of money that comes out near to God is exalted, and if this is known, the illusion does not know that the money is any thing?And if this is out of this, it is intended to be aware that the one who is asked to ask is that his behavior is anything?Then, the answer is a custodian of the question, and his counterpart is the Almighty saying: They said, "Call your Lord to us, show us what the cow is similar to us, and if God wills, he will not say to us.He says that it is a cow, not a humiliation [the cow: 70].Rather, this answer was agreed to that question; Because it was known that the cow is the dignity that I had and described it like that, so he said: What is not possible to carry it on the request of the wiped From it the request of the adjective in which the cow is distinguished from otherwise, so this method is our saying: That answer is a picnic of that question, so we are so that they are so That the one who was commanded by his spending is what it is, it must be cut off by their intention from their saying: What do they spend, it is not the request of what is, but the request is required.And the third of it: it is possible that what is meant is that they asked this question, as if they were told: This is a pioneering question that woke up with anything that was, but it is a condition that it is that it is a condition of money Exclusive to the bank, and this is the same as if the human being is the same as the mood that does not harm any food it was, so he said to the doctor: What do I eat?And the doctor says: Every day in the two times, the meaning was: Everything you wanted, but this condition is like this, the meaning: whatever you want.* * * The loyal question: Know that he was the shepherd of the installation in spending, so he presented the parents; And that is because they are like the one who broke out from the numbers to the existence of the world, then its Lords were in the case of the weakness of the weak, so they were on the authority of the son, who is more Therefore, the Almighty said: Your Lord has eliminated not to worship him except for him and the religion [Al -Asra: 23] and there is a sign that it is not after the sponsorship of the right of God, the right of the right of the right of the right of the right.Because (P-22) God Almighty is the one who has brought the human being from the numbers to the presence in the truth, and the parents are the ones that are left to the world Their right is greater than the right to others; If this is obligatory, they would be able to provide them with the sponsorship of the rights, then the exalted after the two parents are close, and the reason for it is that the human being is not that it is not possible Al -Fakr, but it is necessary for one to be more likely to be likely, and the survival must be likely to be likely, and the kinship is reconciled to be a reason for the ritual: The closeness is the thought of mixing, and the mixture is because of the view of each one of them in the case of the other, if one of them is rich and the other is a poor one, and the one who broke up with the richness, The rich on the jurist has died, and that is one of the strongest of the tunnels.And the second: that if he did not take into account the side of the poor, the poor needed the rejoicing to others, and that is a shame and a bad in his right, so the first is to sponsor with the righteousness About the soul.And the third of it: that the closeness of the human being is a course of part of it, and the spending on the soul is more than spending on others, for this reason, spending was on the proximity of the one who is on the one Human remembered after the close relatives; And that is because they are for their minimum, they do not appreciate the acquisition and their being, they do not have no one who is acquainted with them, for the child who died of his father has died, He honored the loss.Then he mentioned the Almighty after the poor, and the need for these less than the need for the mantle; Because they were able to get more than the estate.Then the Almighty mentioned after them Ibn al -Sibil, then it is due to his obedience from his country, he may fall into the argument and poverty, so this is the ritual of the ritual How to spend, then when this detailed is complete, the best of which is after that, after that, with the integrity, and he said: What do you do from the best of it, for the good of it, so what is the best of God It is better, either from these masculine, or with them, with a calculation of God and a request for the reward of His rewards and an escape from his punishment for his punishment A scientist, meaning that he does not sing out from his knowledge, the weight of an atom in the earth, nor in the sky, so the best of the part of it will reward you, as he said: I do not waste the work of a worker from you Amran: 195] And he said: Whoever does the weight of an atom is better, he sees [Zallala: 7].* * * Fifth question: What is meant is good.For his saying, Azza and Galleh: It is the love of good for hardship [Al -Adiyat: 8] and he said: If the best will be left the will [the cow: 180], then the meaning and what you do from the money, And there is another saying, which is that it is his saying: What do you do from the best of this spending and the bridges of the righteousness and obedience, and this is the first.* * * The sixth question: some of them said: This verse is breezed with the verse of the inheritances, and this is weak; Because he carries the pregnancy of this verse on faces that the copies do not fall into it: one of them: the father of a Muslim said: spending on the two parents, and it is obligatory for them, and the one who is obligatory for the two parents, And what is meant by the close closers and the birth of the child, and their agreed upon at the time of the king, and if we carry the verse on this direction, then he said: He faced him; Because this hypocrisy is obligatory in the event of life, and the inheritance arrives after the death, and also, as it arrives after the death does not describe it as an expense.And the second: that the intention is the one who loves to bring closer to God Almighty in the chapter on the height, so the first person has to spend it in these buds, so he will be presented the first, so the first is (p-23) Violation.And the third: that what is meant is that it is connected to the debts and the closests from where it is sufficient, and when it connects to the orphans and the holders of what is Zakat.And its elevation: It is enticed to want to spend on the parents and the closests, what is sent to the prayer of the womb, and when it distracts it for the homes and the poor, it is not the same The verse is an inner of all these faces, without copying.
