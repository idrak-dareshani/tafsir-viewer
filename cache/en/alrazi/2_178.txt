The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: O you who believe, have been written on you in the free killing of the free and the servant with the servant and the female in the female, so whoever is forgiven by his brother And a performance to him with goodness, that is reduced from your Lord and mercy, so whoever takes over after that has a painful torment.Before the evil in the interpretation, it is necessary to mention the descent in which three of the faces are: one of them: that the reason for its descent is the removal of the rulings that were fixed before Peace be upon him, and that is because the Jews had to kill only, and the Christians were obligated to pardon, and only the Arabs were to be obligated, and they were obligated to kill the killing The religion, but they were showing the transgression in every one of these two judges, but in the killing, then if the killing falls between the two of them They used to say: Let us kill the servant of us free of them, and the woman of us from the man from them, and the man of the two men from them, and they made their inhabitants, the most important of them.Perhaps they increased on that, on what it narrates that one of the honorable people killed a person, so the kinship relatives glimpsed at the murdered son, and they said: What do you want?One of the three said they said: What is it?He said: Either you revive my son, or fill my house from the sky of the sky, or pay me to the sentence of your people until I kill them, then I do not see that I took compensation.“ His servants in the ruling of the penalty and descended this verse.And the second novel in this sense, which is the saying of al -Saddi: The Quran and Al -Muddir were with their debt in the book, the way of the Arabs in the transgression.And the third novel: that it came down in the killing of Hamza, may God be pleased with him.And the ritual narration: what Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri said about some people, and narrated it on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib and on the basis of the Basr al -Basri that the one who is the one Between the freedoms, the two servants, the remembrance, and the two females, the penalty falls, and that is enough for that, but if the killer of the servant is free, or for the sacrifice Recall, and he was free to kill a servant, and he is his standing, for if the slave of the servant will kill the free, they kill him with the condition that they fall from the servant of the servant, and they will be from the servant.The guardians of the freedom of his religion, and if a servant kills a free, then he has a standing, for if the guardians of the free will kill the servant and drop the values ​​of the servant, the servant of the servant After that, to the guardians of the free one, and if they wanted to take all the religion and leave the slave, and if a man kills a woman, then he will be in a woman The guardians of the woman killed him and performed the half of the religion, and if the woman kills a man, then he has a luminous.They were given all the religion and left it, they said, God Almighty has revealed this verse to Bayyan that the confessing with heasing is a pioneer between the freedoms, the two servants, the two servants, and the two servants, and the servants, When the bush is disturbed, the confessing is not shocked in it.* * * If we know, because of the descent, let us return to interpretation.As for his words, the Almighty: He was written on you, and it was written on you: He was imposed on you, so this is the memorial that requires the duty of two sides: one of them: that he said: The knowledge of the law, the Almighty said: The fasting has been written for you [Al -Baqarah: 183] and he said: It was written upon you if one of you is attended by death if you leave the best of the commandment [Al -Baqarah: 180].It is the cruisy prayers, that is, the paradoxes.And peace be upon him said: “Three were written on me, and you were not written on you.” The second: for the word (upon you) is a poetry, as it is in his saying, the Almighty: to God for people, Hajj is the pilgrimage [Al -Imran: 97].He said: So that so, so that so and so did so if he did the same as his verb, he said: He said, and he returned to their traces of their stories [Al -Kahf: 64] and he said: And he said to his sister: Its impact, and the story was called a story; Because the story equals the storyteller, and he was called retribution; Because he recalls the same as the news of people, and the deficiency is called a shortened to the equivalent of its two sides.As for the saying of the Exalted: in the dead, that is, by killing the death; Because the word (in) may be used for the reason, as he said to him, peace be upon him: Those who believed in you, and the killing of the dead, so the revelation of the verse was referred to, and the shadows of all the believers should be upon the sake of those who are killed, That the other killer is outside this general, and the killer has entered the specialization as well in many pictures, and it is if the father kills his son, and the master of his servant, and if he was killed, and if he is the slave of his servant, if he kills his servant.A war or a profession, and if a Muslim was killed, a Muslim was wrong, but the year that was entered by the specialization is a pilgrimage as he prepared.(P-42) It is said: Your saying: This verse requires the path of retribution in which Ikkalan: The first: that the penalty is that if it is obligatory, either on the killer, or upon me, or upon me.And the three sections are false, but rather said: It is not obligatory for the killer; Because the killer does not have to kill himself, but he is forbidden for him, but rather he said: It is other than that of blood; Because the guardian of blood is good in the verb and the lane To piety [Al -Baqarah: 237] and the third is also false; Because he is a foreigner of that killing and foreigners about something that is not related to him.The second question: If we indicate that the vocabulary is a phrase for leveling, then the concept of the verse was positive, and on this estimation, the verse is not indicated by the affirmation of the dead, according to the affliction of the dead.The most in the chapter is that the verse is indicative of the patronage of the privilege in the murder that is a legislator, and on this estimation, the significance of the verse will be brought down on the killing of the verse on the kings By killing.The answer to the first question: from Wajin: The first: that what is meant is the affirmation of the establishment of the penalty on the imam or whoever runs his chapters; Because when the boundaries of the steps are obtained, it is not permissible for the imam to leave the leaders; Because it is one of the sentences of the believers, and the appreciation: O imams, you have written to you in the end of the penalty.The second: It is a discourse with the killer and the estimation: O killers, you have written the soul with the demand of the guardian of the height, and that; Because the killer does not have it to be able to believe, and it is not for him to be denied, but the adulterer and the skeptical is the one who is raised from the limit, and they also have that it is not the same Adami.As for the answer to the second question: it is that the appearance of the verse requires the positive level of leveling in killing, and the level of killing is the row of the killing, and the affirmation of the adjective requires the positive of the time.Expanding the positive killing from this face, and separated from what we mentioned: the first question: Abu Hanifa went to the obligation of the pillar, the one who is the one He said that the obligation of the baptism is either the penalty or the religion, and Abu Hanifa transmitted this verse, and the direction of the one who is mentioned in the end of the weak; Because it is whether the addressee of this discourse was the imam or the ruler of blood, then he is in agreement with conditions, whether the ruler of blood wants the killing on the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the command, The penalty is subject, but the conflict is that the guardian of blood can be able to do so to the religion, and there is no significance in the verse that if he wants the religion, he will not have that.* * * The second question: they disagreed with the same as the similarity that this verse was indicated by its positiveness, so Al -Shafi’i said: The first killing is taken into account, if he was the first one, for the first killing, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first one, if he was the first killing By cutting the hand, the hand of the killer was cut off, so if he died from it in that time, or the grief of his neck, and so if I would burn the first with the fire, I will be burned.Otherwise, his neck was grieved, and Abu Hanifah, may God have mercy on him, said: What is meant by the example is the same as the one who can be able to do so.The Hajj of the Shafi’i, may God have mercy Between the two verbs, and that requires the cruise of the level of all the headed faces, and its faces are indicated by one of them: one of them is that it is permissible to say: How to kill, and the discretion comes out of the words, what he had to enter, so he entered this that the killing of the killing inside the text.And secondly: If we did not, in this sense of this verse on the equivalent of all matters, the verse would be beautiful, and if we have governed in it, the public (P-43) (P-43) (P-43) But it has become a specialized in some of the pictures, and the specialization is lonely from the busts.And the third of it: that the verse, if it is not provided except the positive of the settlement in something of the affairs, there is no two things except when they are equal in some of the things, so it is not possible.Something of bit, and this face is close to the second, so it was proven that this verse benefits the existence of the level of all the faces, then this is confirmed by this.The requirement of the same as the one who is the same: a bad reward, the same as it is [Al -Shura: 40], so whoever is accustomed to you, be accustomed to it with the same: Whoever does a bad, then it is only permissible for the same [Ghafir: 40] Then these texts are confirmed by the well -known news that is the most famous of the Messenger, and it is the one who has said: We burned him, and whoever drove us, "and from what is narrated that he is Jewish, he gave up the head of a girl with the carpentry, and he killed her, so the Prophet was commanded ﷺ to be broken by This was proven by the significance of the verse with the path of the verses, and with these hadiths on the saying of the Shafi’i, a strong amount.Abu Hanifa embarked on his saying, peace be upon him: The answer is that the hadiths when the connotations of the verses remained empty of the exhibitions, and God knows.The third question: they agreed that this killer is not passed and insisted on leaving the repentance; For heasing is a hungry in his right to be punished, and if it is a repentant, they agreed on that it is not permissible to be a wise man, and that is because the evidence is that Application is an acceptance.He deserves to be punished, and because he, peace be upon him, said: “The repentance eradicates the love.” This is clouded and our companions said: God will do what he does and does not have any symptoms in anything, and the disgraced said: Rather, it was made to be a kind of him, then they said: It costs after the killing, so how is this killing to be kind to it?And they answered it That this killing has a benefit for the guardian of the murderer from where the healing and the benefit of the captives of the costs from where it is imprisoned from the people of the people from the one It is when he knows that it is necessary and that it has become a reason for him to be good and the left of the secrets and the frequency.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: The free and the servant with the servant and the female in the female, so he said: Al -Harin and between the two servants and between the two females.And beg on him with Jajah: The first: The thousand and the blame in his saying: The free benefit the general person, and his saying: The free one is free to be killed by all of the warmth He killed a free slave, for that freedom was murdered, not free, and that contradicts the positive that every free is free.The second: The B is from the vanity of the run, so it will be attached to a verb, so the estimation will be: the free is killed by the free, and the beginning is not the best He is equal to him or more than him, and on the two estimates, this requires that every freedom be killed by the free and that is to contradict the free one.The third: It is that it is a reason for the first verse as the patronage of the similarity, and it is his saying: He wrote to you in the killing, so when he mentioned his mind, he said: This indicates that the sponsorship of the settlement in the freedom and the slave is considered; Because his saying: the free and the servant with the servant came out of the interpretation of the interpretation of his saying: It was written on you in the killing and the positive of the killing of al-Qadr al-Harq The servant is a thunderbolt of the pursuit of the level in this sense, so it is obligatory not to be a holy, for if the characteristic transcends its saying, the Almighty is: and we have written to them.[Al -Ma’idah: 45] Our answer is that the risk is with us for two ways: one of them: that his saying: We wrote to them in it that the breath is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same, and the soul We have been held by a law for us, and there is no doubt that our law is stronger in the significance than the law of those before us.And secondly: that the verse that we hold us is a disgrace to the rulings of souls on detailing and specialization, and there is no doubt that the private is presented over the year.Then the companions of this saying said: The appearance of this verse is that the servant is not killed except by the servant, and that the female is not killed except by the female, except that this is our immorality.Conservation, and the meaning is attached to the coordination of this verse, and that meaning is not supplied in killing the free servant, so it is obligatory for us to remain.As for the consensus, it is an appearance.It is necessary to be killed by the servant who is without him, and so is the saying in killing the female by the male, as for killing the male with the female, it is not in it.The second saying: that its saying is the Almighty: the free one does not benefit the confusion of the bit, but rather it is beneficial to the law of the penalty between the masculine, without it, it will be in it.And they embarrassed him with two Jahin: The first: that his saying: The female in the female is required to be free to the free woman with the anxious woman, and if if he said: With the servant, it is forbidden for that to fall into the contradiction.The second: His saying is the Almighty: He wrote to you in the killing of a complete sentence, which is independent of itself, and its saying: The free one is a specialization for the one who is a special one.With the remembrance, and if the remembrance of the independent sentence is presented, it was specialized in some parts with the remembrance of the remembrance, it is not forbidden from the evidence of the ruling in the sake of the parts of the parts.It is possible for the exiles of the ruling on the one who is the one who is the pictures of the pictures.Then they disagreed in that good, so they mentioned in it two sides: the first: which is the most mostly upon him, that this is the good that the people of what was upon him were the people We go to this verse; They were killing the servant of them free from the killing of the killer, so the benefit of specialization is their milestone from that.And he knew that the two sayings of the first saying to say: His exalted say: He was written for you in the killing of this.Because the penalty is a phrase of equality, and the killing of the free servant did not get the sponsorship of equality; Because he is increased to him in the honor and in the eligibility of the judiciary, the imam and testimony, so it is obligatory not to be hidden.The most in the chapter is that he left the work with this text in killing the scientist with ignorance and mourning with lies, except that it remains in the place of the collection of the origin of the original, then the one who says: You have to kill you in the killing, and it is necessary to kill the freedom with the servant, except that we have said that his saying: the free and the servant of the servant who prevents the pamphlet of the slave of the slave of the slave of This is special and what is before it is a year, and the private is presented for the year, not if the private is connected to the year in the memorizer, then it is a neighbor of the junction, and there is no doubt in the public.The second direction in Bayyan is a special specialization: what Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri said on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Taleb and Al -Hassan Al -Basri, that this is the one who is in the way With retribution, but in the birds of the pictures, which is whether the retribution is located between the free and the servant, and between the remembrance and the female, then there is not only satisfied with the heights, but it is necessary for us to do so.The saying in the reason for the descent of this verse, except that many of the investigators claimed that this The transfer was not valid from (P-45) Ali ibn Abi Taleb, which is also weak at the view; Because it has been proven that the group is killed by the one and does not return, so the male is killed by the female and does not return, and because the feet are the end of what is obligatory in the killing, then it is not obligatory He is with him.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: Whoever pardoned him from his brother is something that follows the well -being and a performance to him with goodness, know that those who said: the one who is the one who is a doctrine; Either the penalty, or the religion, they hold this verse and they said: The verse indicates that in this story, he is healthy and exempt from it It is not permissible to be the killer; Because the phenomenon of forgiveness is the overthrow of the truth and that is coming from the guardian who has the right to kill, so the inclusion of the verse became: if he pardoned and has the same as the blood of the blood Let the killer follow that forgiveness with a well -being, and his saying: something vague, so it is imperative to carry it on the precedent, and it is the one who is the one who is the one The estimation of the verse: If the pardon is obtained to fight the camels, let the deadly killer to follow the well -being, and to lead him with money.With consensus, it is not obligatory to perform otherwise, so that the duty is the religion, and this indicates that the obligation of the pillar is the feet or the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money, and if it is not the money.When pardoning the leadership, and from this face, the saying of the Almighty: that is a reduced from your Lord and the mercy of any, and the choice is for you in the goodness of the You have; Because the judgment in the Jews is the necessity of the punishment and the judgment in the Christians, the necessity of pardon, so it was relieved of this nation and the abomination of them is allegedly among them.And mercy in the right of this nation; Because the guardian of blood may be the effect of it from the leaders if it is needed for money, and the leaders may have a effect if it is a desire to recover and pay the evil of the evil The good is for him as he loves him as a mercy from God in his right.If it is said: We do not surrender that the well -being is the guardian of blood and his saying of forgiveness is the overthrow of the truth, and that is only suitable for the blood of blood.We said: We do not surrender that forgiveness is the overthrow of the truth, but what is meant by his saying: Whoever pardoned him from his brother is something, that is, whoever is easy for him from his brother is something that is said: That is, easy, and it is said: Take what is pardoned, that is, what is easy, God Almighty said: Take pardon, and the estimation of the verse is: Whoever is from the guardians of blood and is easy for him from the brother of the brother Let the blood of blood follow that killer in the demand of that money, and the killer will lead to the children of blood.That God Almighty urged the guardians if they called for the reconciliation of blood on all of them or some of them to satisfy it and pardon the leaders.We greeted us that the well -being is the guardian of blood, but it is not permissible to say: What is meant is that the penalty is partner among the partners, so they pardoned one of them, so they will be exempt from Money, God Almighty has the silence of the silent partnership by following the killer with the well -being, and commanded the killer to perform to him with charity.We greeted us that the well -being is the guardian of blood, whether he had a partner or was not, but it is not permissible to say: This is the conditions of the murderer's satisfaction, except that it is the one who is the one who is a miracle.Because it is steadfast, not referred; Because the phenomenon of every worker is that it makes all worldly to the payment of the killing of itself; Because if he is killed, there is no soul for him, nor money, but the humiliation of money is in the life of the soul, so when this satisfaction was in the world, the most is not a crime, and it is left.And the answer: Carrying out the memorization of pardon in this verse on the overthrow of the right of the punishment, the first of his pregnancy to send (P-46) the killer of money to the sons of blood, and from the one who is the one who is the one who is from the blood.The truth of the pardon is the projection of the truth, so it should not be a truth in otherwise, a payment of your destination, and the sacred in this verse on the right of the right to the right of the right to the right of the truth You mentioned; Because when his saying was presented: He wrote to you in the killing, he was pregnant with his saying: So whoever pardoned him from his brother is something on the projection of the right Because his saying: something is vague, and he carried this vague to that meaning that is the previously mentioned.The second: If it was intended for pardon, what you mentioned, his saying was: Fear with the well -being and a performance of it with vast goodness; Because after the money was reached to it with the ease and the ease, there is no need for it to follow it, and there is no need for that given until it is commanded by the performance of that money.As for the second question, it is a burden from two faces: the first: that that words are walked with the hypocrisy of a special image, which is whether the right of the penalty is shared by the one who is blessed with a shame between the one who is blessed The other was silent, and the verse is indicative of the partner of this judgment on release, so the absolute memorization is carried on the image that is different.The second: that distraction is in his saying: and a performance to it with charity, a guerrilla, which is a prior to a precedent male, and the previously mentioned is the well -being, so this money is required to the well -being, and it is for you However, the well -being was void.As for the third question: that the condition of contentment is either that it is forbidden to disappear, or if it is possible to disappear, then if it is forbidden to disappear, then it is necessary to be a place Development on divorce, and if it is possible to disappear.What the verse has not been referred to is contrary to the back and that it is not permissible.* * * And when this research summarized, then we say: the verse remained in it research, which we remember in the exposure of the question and the answer.The first research: How do you install his saying: Who is his pardon for him from his brother something?Answer: His estimation: Whoever has his brother is something of pardon, and he is like his saying: He walked with more than one walking, and a group of traffic.The second research: that (my pardon) exceeded by not the imam, then what is said: He who is forgiven for him].The answer: It is transgressing from the perpetrator and to the sin, and it is said: I forgive it for so and his sins, God Almighty said: May God forgive you [repentance: 43], so if you are a person who is a person who is.Yes, as you say: I forgive him for his sin, and I passed on him from him, and this verse on him, as if it was said: Whoever is forgiven for him, then he is from him Genius.* * * The third research: Why was it said (something) of pardon?The answer is from two voices: one of them: that this is formed if the truth is only the rulers, then it is said: the fence is not bitten, then it is not left for it, then it is not for it.The entire group was either the standing, or the money was the group of its right.Because he may have pardoned from the rule without money, and he may pardon everyone, so when the matter was like that, it is permissible to say, so whoever is forgiven by his brother.The second answer: that the denying thing is a great, great; Because it is permissible for it to be deluded that pardon does not affect the descriptions of the leaders, except that it is pardon for all of it, so he showed that the forgiveness is like the pardon of his part.The rituals of the rule, and the pardon of (P-47), some of the guardians of his right, such as the pardon of all of them from their creation, and if he had known the thing, he would not have understood that This meaning is understood from it, so he said: “Whoever pardoned him from his brother is something.* * * Follow -up search: in any sense, God has proven and described the brotherhood.The answer: It was said: Ibn Abbas holds this verse in the Bayan, as the evildoer is a believer from three of the faces: the first: that he is the one who has the right to be a believer.The penalty is upon him if the killing of the baptism is the aggression, and it is unanimously from the cabaret, and this indicates that the great owner is a believer.The second: that the exalted, the brother, between the killer and between the blood of blood, and no doubt that this brother is in the cause of religion, because of the saying of God: 10] Had it not been for faith that remains with immorality, otherwise the brotherhood that has been shared by faith is the reason for faith.The third: It is the Almighty to spoil the murderer, and the delegation to pardon, but it is worthy of the believer.Books You have to be killed in the killing, they are the imams, so the question is visiting, and if we say: They are the killers, so his answer is from two sides: one of them: that the killer before he took it, was the one who was killed.God called him a believer in this interpretation.The second: that the killer may repent, and when it is a believer, then he is the highest in which he entered into it other than repenting to the path of alienation.As for the second face: It is the remembrance of the brotherhood, and they answered him from his faces: The first: that the verse is a descending before the one who kills anyone, and there is no doubt that the believer is a brother The killing.The second: The apparent that the evildoer is repenting, and on this estimation he will be the guardian of the one who is his brother.And the third: It is permissible for him to make him a brother in the proportions as his saying: And to the return of their brother Hudh [Al -A'raf: 65].And the lord: He obtained between the guardians of the blood and between the killer, an attachment and a choice, and this destiny is sufficient to release the name of the brotherhood, as you say to the man: The lowest attachment.And the fifth: He mentioned it with the memory of the brotherhood to convert to one of them on his owner by mentioning what is fixed between them from the gender in the declaration and the belief.The answer: that this face with its families requires that the brothers be given with time without time, and with a description without a row, and God has proven to the brother.* * * As for his words, he said: Fear about the well -known and a performance to him with charity, in which he has research: the first search: his saying: Fabrin with the well -known.Because it is a beginner, deleted and estimated: its judgment is followed, or it is a beginner that is deleted by his estimation: it is a follower.The second research: It was said: On the well -being followed by the well -known, and the pardon for him is a performance with goodness, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, Al -Hassan, Qatdah, and Mahda, and he said: The forgiveness of the well -being is followed by a well -known, and that is known to him with charity.The third research: the following is not to be tightened by demands, but rather in it on the habit of the dead, if it is difficult, then the look is not, and if it is not, then it is not.He asks him for leadership on the destiny of the right, and if it is a find for other than the obligatory money, then the groaning until he is brought and rejoicing, and that he does not prevent him from the reason for As for (P-48) performance with charity, it is intended for it to be invited in the event of a possibility and does not delay it with the existence, and it is not provided for what is not obligatory for it, A beautiful saying.As for his words, the Exalted: This is a reduction from your Lord and a mercy, and he has faces.One of it: that what is meant by saying: That is, that is, the judgment of the row of the penalty and the religion, a reduction in your right; Because the pardon and the religion are deprived of the people of Al -Tawara and Al -Quds, who are written on them, the bit of bit The escape and the pardon are written on them, and this nation is a good one between the penalty and the pardon and the pardon of them, and it will be expanded to them, and this is the saying of Ibn Abbas.And the second: that his saying: that is returned to his saying: a follower of the well -known and a performance to him with goodness.As for his saying: Whoever has taken advantage of after that dismissal means the equivalent of the limit to what is more than it, Ibn Abbas and Al -Hassan said: What is meant is that he does not kill after the pardon; Because the people of the ignorance, if they pardoned and took the religion, then they disappeared after that with the fight, killing him, so God forbade from that, and it was said: He fought, or asked for more than what he had from the religion, or the limit of the limit then showed him how to release.It is obligatory to be carried on the whole of the perpetrators of the memorizer, so he has a painful torment and in which they say: One of them: and it is the most famous that it is a type of torment in the last.The second: It was narrated from Qutdah that the painful torment is to kill no referral and is not exempt from it, nor is it accepted from it for his saying to him, peace be upon him.Al -Daiya, “It is the narrator of Al -Hassan and Said Bin Jabir.This saying is weak to its faces: one of them: that the concept is from the painful torment when release is the torment of the hereafter.And the second: We have shown that the standing is a torment that is a torment and a bullish, as it is in the right to repent, so it is not valid to release the name of the torment on it except in the face of the face.And the third of it: that the killer of those who forgive him is not permissible to be specialized that he could not be able to pardon him; Because that is the right of blood, and he has a measure of a measurement on his ability to drop the paths of rights, and God knows best.
