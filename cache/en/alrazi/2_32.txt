The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: They said: “You will not know you except what you have taught us that you are the wise knowledgeable.I know the absence of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you seem and what you were associated with (P-192).Whoever spoils it said: When they know their mistakes in this question, they returned, repented, and reserved for their mistakes by saying them: they will not know you They denied their disobedience, so they mentioned in that and two sides: The first: that they said that on the face of the confessions with the miracle, and the peace is that they do not know what they know.Because they said: We only know what you taught us, so if you do not teach us, how can we know it?The second: that the angels only said: I will make it in it because God Almighty knows them, as if they said that you have learned that they spoil the earth and shed the blood.In it who spoils it, and this is the names, you are what you have taught, how do we know it?Here are the questions: (The first question): Our companions were transmitted by the Almighty saying: There is no knowledge of us except what you taught us that the knowledge is a creature of God, and he said: The knowledge of us is only from his own Other than that, it is not said: The learning is a phrase for the benefit of the matter that is arranged for knowledge, even if the condition is obtained and the municipality is not The knowledge is arranged upon him, the place of evidence, and God has done so that he did; Because we say the influenced in the existence of knowledge is not the same indication, but rather the view in the evidence, and that view, the action of the servant, so it was not the same Its saying is contradicted: there is no knowledge of us except what you taught us.* * * (The second question): The people of Islam embraced this verse that there is no way to know the absences of the absences, except by learning God, and it is not exalted The priesthood and the norms, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: He has the confessions of the unseen, and he does not know it except it is [Al -Anam: 59] and his saying: the scholar of the absence, so there is no He is satisfied with a messenger [Al -Jin: 26, 27] and for the sake to say to the one who is disgraced: If you explain the admission to the place of the evidence, then I have the stars of the stars.The conditions of this world, then if you recite it on this, it was also that of the knowledge of God Almighty, and it can also be said that the angels are not for the sake Because one of us was miraculous.(The third question): The knowledge is one of the attributes of the complete genius in knowledge, and the complete genius is not achieved only when the surrounding is all the information, and it is only The absolute knowledge is not only, so he said that you are the wise knowledge of the path of life.(The following question): The wise is used on two sides: one of them: in the sense of the knowledge, so this is one of the attributes of the self, and on this interpretation: The other: It is the one who is active for what is not symptoms for anyone.So that is one of the verbs of the verb, so we do not say that it is wise in the eternal, and the closest here is that what is meant is the second meaning, otherwise it is necessary to repent, as if the angels said: With all the information, I can teach Adam, and you are the wise in this act that is in it, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas: that the angels are the one who is the wise of the wise man Calculating the earth.
