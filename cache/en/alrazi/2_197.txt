The Quranic researcher (P-137) said by the Almighty: The pilgrimage is a well-known for the pilgrimage, so the pilgrimage is in them, so there is no rip, no, no, and no, and no newness in the pilgrimage, and what you do from the good The best of the piety is and you fear my first people; There are issues: the first question: it is known that the pilgrimage is not the same as the most famous, so we must be interpreted, and there is no one: The most famous of the information, so the additive is deleted, and it is like their saying: the cold is two months, that is, the time of the cold is two months.The second: The pilgrimage is the most famous, that is, there is no pilgrimage except in this famous, and it is not permissible other than it as the people of the ignorance were in the face of it.The source added to the famous.The third: It is possible to correct the verse from others, which is that he made the most famous breath of Hajj, when the pilgrimage was in them as their saying: a night, and a righteous.* * * The second question: I am gathered the ones who are shawl and that is the seat of the most famous pilgrimage, and they differed in the pilgrimage, so he said: The most famous pilgrimage, which is the saying of the money of the Most Merciful, may God bless him, and Abu Hanifah, may God have mercy on him, said: Al -Sha’abi, Mujahid and Al -Hassan, and Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The pilgrimage of Malik, may God be pleased with him, from his faces: The first: that God Almighty mentioned the most famous of the gathering, and the least of it is three.The second pilgrimage: that the days of the sacrifice do some of what is connected to the pilgrimage, and it is the throwing of the jams, and the woman, if you are menstruating, you will delay the rituals that are not from the one who is not from The twenty, and the ears of the fraud of the delay of the veil of the visitor to the last month.The answer is about the first: from two faces: one of them: that the gathering is notified in which there is nothing beyond the one, with the evidence of his saying: your hearts are listened to [4].The second: He descended some of the month, as it is said, as it is said: I saw you a year like this; He saw him at an hour.والجَوابُ عَنِ الثّانِي: أنَّ رَمْيَ الجِمارِ يَفْعَلُهُ الإنْسانُ وقَدْ حَجَّ بِالحَلْقِ والطَّوافِ والنَّحْرِ مِن إحْرامِهِ, فَكَأنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِن أعْمالِ الحَجِّ, والحائِضُ إذا طافَتْ بَعْدَهُ فَكَأنَّهُ في حُكْمِ The judiciary is not in the ruling on performance, but those who said: The ten days of the first pilgrimage are among the most famous pilgrims, they have been held in it in it with the one who is the one: the first: the one who is the one who is the one: That the day of the greatest pilgrimage on the day of the sacrifice, and the second: that the day of the sacrifice is a time for the pillar of the pilgrimage, and it is the circumambulation of the visitor, and the Shafi’i is the best of God, the one who is pleased with him That the pilgrimage is missing the vagina on the day of the sacrifice, and worship does not be It is lost with the meeting of its time, so this is the report of this doctrine.The remaining two: the first: the first: that he said that he said before: They ask you about the people, say it is the time of people and the pilgrimage, so he made all the people of the time.The second: He was famous for the majority of the companions that they said: It is complete the pilgrimage to prohibit the woman from the role of his family, and whoever is after his house is the distress that he does not His family with pilgrimage except before the most famous pilgrimage, and this indicates that the most famous pilgrimage is not restricted with a special time.The answer to the first: that that is a general verse, and this is the verse, which is its saying: the pilgrimage is the most famous information, and the private is presented to the year.On the second: that the text is not opposed by the marital effect of the companions.* * * The third question: His exalted say: information in which there are faces: one of them: that the pilgrimage is in the year one time (P-138) in the most famous, in the most famous of it.Like the Umrah that it comes in the year, and I refer them in the knowledge of those famous for what they knew before we descended this, and on this one, then the saying of the one who said: They did not know, but it came as a decree.The second: that what is intended for it is known to the Messenger of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him.The third: It is intended to be temporary in certain signs that it is not permissible to be presented and not delay [Table: 37].* * * The following question: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: It is not permissible for anyone to be prepared by Hajj before the most famous pilgrimage, and with him, Ahmad, and I said: May God be pleased with them: It is not permissible in all the Sunnah.The argument of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, his saying: The Hajj is a well -known and famous for the collection of a gathering of recklessness, so it is not the same.It is three and when the denial is scattered to the lowest, so it was proven that what is meant is that the most famous pilgrimage is three, and the interpreters agreed that these three are three, And some of the pilgrimage, and if this is proven, then he says: It is not permissible for a warrior to be forbidden before the time, and three faces are indicated by him: It is valid for a measure on prayer.The second: The sermon in the Friday prayer is not permissible before the time; Because it was evaluated by the place of two knees from the noon, because it is not valid for warrants and it is a honesty in worship.The third: that the burning does not remain correct to perform the pilgrimage if the pilgrimage is gone before the performance, because it does not hold a right to perform the pilgrimage before the time.Because the survival is easier than the appetite.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, and Jahan: The first: His Excellency said: They ask you about the people.For people and the pilgrimage, so he made all the people of the pilgrimage, and it is not a saying of the pilgrimage.As the time was called a pilgrimage in his saying: the pilgrimage is the most famous, but this is the first; Because the warning to the pilgrimage is close to the time.The second argument: that the warning is a commitment to the pilgrimage, so the reward for its presentation at the time is like the warning.The answer to the first: that the verse that we mentioned is more special than the verse that you are holding.The answer to the second: that the difference is between the vow and between the forbidden that the time is considered a perpetrator of performance and communication to the warning of the performance with the way that the performance is not made, Harm is with his being obligatory, as it is also a pupil in performance and a contract on it, so it is not a crime that has become a time.And the Almighty said: Whoever imposed the pilgrimage in them; There are two issues: the first question: the meaning of “imposition” in the language is obligatory and obligatory, it is said: I am obligated to you like this, that is, I answered it, and the origin of the meaning of the abuse, the abuse of the abuse in Al -Arabi: The hypocrisy of the sadness in the praise, in the mobilization, and in it, and the imposition of the sitting: the sadness in which it falls in the time, and the imposition of the wilderness: the sadness that is in it.Because it is a necessity for the servant, like the sadness of the Glory, so it was imposed in the sense of it, and it came in the Qur’an: he was imposed in the sense of it, and it is the saying of it: [Al -Nur: 1] With lightness, and his saying: God has imposed for you to solve your faith [Al -Taraim: 2] and this is also a return to the sense of the piece; Because whoever cuts something, he has lost it from others, and God is exalted, if he imposed something during his other, so he was imposed in the sense of his duty, and he was imposed with me.(P-139) * * * A forbidden, as there is no disagreement that he does not become a pilgrim except with a verb that he does, and he is removed from being permissible, and he is forbidden for him the hunter, the confusion, the goodness, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, and the good, and the good, and the good, and the good, and the good, and the good, and the good This is not that, and for the sake of the prohibition of these things, it is forbidden; Because he did what these things forbade themselves, and for this reason also the seat was called a sanctuary; Because he prohibits what is in which he was not forbidden, so he said to him: He who imposed the pilgrimage in them is that it is not necessary for the sake of the forbidden one who does not For his sake, he becomes a pilgrim and a forbidden, and then the jurisprudence was disturbed that that action is what is it?Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: It holds the warrant of the municipality of the intention, without a need for discipline.And Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, said: It is not valid in the warrant of the municipality of the intention until it is joined To them, the loyalty or the market of guidance, the lock, may God have mercy on him, said in his “interpretation”: It is narrated from a group that whoever feels his guidance or imitated him, and he is a sake of his sake Omar said: If he was imitated or felt, then he will be forbidden, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas: If the guidance and his companions are imitated, he wants the life and the pilgrimage, then he is forbidden.The argument of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, is a face: the first pilgrimage: the saying of the Almighty: whoever is imposed in the pilgrimage, then there is no puff, no cousin, nor the righteousness, and there is no It will be a expressions of discipline or the market of guidance, for it is not a lot of fragrance in the custody of his being forbidden, not with a truth, or a vagina, so he did not Explanation of the intention, and the imposition of the pilgrimage is obligatory to hold the pilgrimage, with the evidence of its words, the Almighty: so it is not obligatory, so the intention is sufficient.The second pilgrimage: the appearance of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: “Rather, for every one who intended.” The third argument: the measurement; It is that the pilgrimage is a stop from the banners, so it is correct in it with the intention like fasting.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him and Jahan: The first: What was narrated by Abu Mansour Al -Maatidi in his “interpretation” on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, he said: Powered." The second: The pilgrimage is a worship, it is a solution and a prohibition, so it is not necessary for it except with the same intention as prayer.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: There is no journey, no veil, nor a new argument in the Hajj, so he has questions: the first question: Ibn Katheer and Abu Omar read?And the call to "and not" the "in the interest, and those who read all the erection.And know that the words in the difference between the two readings in the meaning must be preceded by two submission, the first: that everything has a name, so the name is the name The name, and the movements of the name and the paths of his state of evidence of the name of the name, your saying: Ended, ravaged, and boring, indicating the conditions of those essence, which is the effective, the effective, and the additional, and this is the mind of the mind until the original is the original, And the adjective in the midst of the adjective, so on this name indicating the essences, it is noteworthy that it is preserved by the skeleton It was placed to define different conditions in the same name, so I want to know the name of the name other than the tattooing of the so -of -being of the name of the name.If I want in some of the leaflets, it must be said by the erection, because it is the lighter of the movements and its closeness to the silence.(P-140) The second presidency: If you say: “No man” is in line, then you have denied what is All of her individuals are cut off, but if you say: “There is no man” by lifting and calling, then you have denied a man who is vague, and this is not a matter This wiper is only with a separate, and you have proven that your saying: “There is no man.” If you know these two submissions, let us return to the difference between the two readings, then say: As for those who read “three” by the basis, then the one who is the one who is the one who is the first By lifting with the calls, and the third with the installation; That is indicated that the fulfillment of the negligence is more severe than the fulfillment of the negligence of the ritual and the debt, and that is because the spoil is a dormant about the judiciary of the rituals, Because the argument desires to walk his saying, and the debauchery is a phrase for the violation of the command of God, and the argument does not lead to the truth, and many are offered to be given to the abuse and the abuse of the And hatred.When the new chair is disturbed by all kinds of ugliness, God has not permitted in this reader with the increase of the dirt and the exaggeration in the negation, but the one said: الأوَّلَيْنِ بِالرَّفْعِ والثّالِثَ بِالنَّصْبِ فَقَدْ حَمَلَ الأوَّلَيْنِ عَلى مَعْنى النَّهْيِ, كَأنَّهُ قِيلَ: فَلا يَكُونُ رَفَثٌ ولا فُسُوقٌ, وحَمَلَ الثّالِثَ عَلى الإخْبارِ بِانْتِفاءِ الجِدالِ, This is what they said, but it is not that it was not that the first was forbidden, and the third was special.* * * Everything that relates to the consensus, so the pipe with the tongue is the remembrance of the group and what is related to it, and the spoiler with the slander of the touch and the thym The absence of the women is not exaggerated, and they needed that Ibn Abbas was limiting his camel while he was forbidden and said: They are walking with us, if you are not.Her Abu Al -Ala: Do you go and you are forbidden?He said: Rather, what was said about the women, and others said: The spoiler is the saying of the treachery and the obscenity, and these were transmitted with news and language; As for the news, the prayer and peace be upon him: “If the day of the day of your day is one of you, then it will not be spilled and does not ignore, then it is a sample of his sham He only carries the saying of the treachery and obscenity, and the language is that it was narrated from Abu Ubayd that he said: The ritual puffs are in the penetration, it is said: The man is spilled, and the man said: Language of speech.As for immorality, I know that immorality and immorality are one and they are a source of immorality, and we have mentioned us as before that the pose is the abandonment of the obedience Those who are many of the investigators who carried it on all the sins.Its types, so loyal to some kinds of immorality are governed by a sign, and this is confirmed by the words of the Almighty: So, the Lord of the Lord: And his saying: He hated it to you, disbelief, immorality, and disobedience [Al -Hijrat: 7].Some of them went to the fact that what is meant by some types, then they mentioned his face They rejected the titles of the name of the name, after faith [the stone: 11].As for the news, it was said by prayer and peace: And the second: What is meant by him is harmful and stuffed.The third: Ibn Zaid said: It is the sacrifice for the idols, so they were in their pilgrimage to sacrifice for the sake of Hajj, and for the sake of idols, and he said: Do not eat, and do not.اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وإنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ [الأنْعامِ: 121]; And his saying: Or a immorality is the best of God for him [Al -Anam: 145].And Al -Rabaa: Ibn Omar said: It is the sinner in killing the hunter and others of what is forbidden from it.And the fifth: that the spoiler is the gathering and its progress with the solution, and the debauchery is the gathering and its preservation on the path of adultery.And the sixth: Muhammad ibn al -Tabiri said: The mosquitoes are the determination to perform the pilgrimage if it is not determined to leave its prohibitions.As for the grandfather, it is an effective from the argument, and its origin is from the grandfather who is from the killing, it is said: an alternative to a renewed and a grandfather, that is, a void, and the grandfather is the name of the consequences, because it is not the name The quarrel was called an argument because each one of the two characteristics is that his friend is separated from his opinion, and the interpreters mentioned it in this way.The first: Al -Hasan said: It is the grandfather from which the exit is afraid of insults, denying, and ignorance.And the second: Muhammad ibn Kaab al -Qarashi said: If a Quraysh, if they gathered with me, they said: “Our pilgrimage is full,” and he said: “Rather, we will come to them.” The third: Malik said in the “Al -Muwaqd” the new pilgrimage that a Quraysh was standing at the ritual poet in Muzdalfah with a diller, and they were not.They argue with these saying: “We are wounded, and these people say:“ We are woven.Your Lord, for you to be straight, straight, and if you argue with you, say God, know what you do [Hajj: 67] Malik said: This is the seriousness when it is narrated, and God knows best.And the lord: Al -Qasim bin Muhammad said: The new pilgrimage is to say each of them: The pilgrimage today, and others say: but tomorrow, and so they commanded that they make the Shahr al -Shahr on the vision of the people, and others were making it the same They were different, so each of them said: This day is the day of Eid.And some of them say: Rather, tomorrow, God Almighty forbids them, as if he was told: He has shown us that the people have been tied to people and the pilgrimage, so they will be upset, so do not be up to you, and do not stand up.This side.Fifth: Al -Qafil, may God have mercy on him, said: He enters into this time, what they have fallen into the Messenger of God ﷺ “When they commanded them to annul the pilgrimage to Umrah, then they will be to the life.From our doctrines, we have been subjugated?The sixth: Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd said: Their new ones in the pilgrimage in the causes of their disagreement in which one of the calamities in the pilgrimage was on the authority of the rituals of peace and blessings be upon him.The sword: that they were different in the two years, so they were said to them: There is no response in the pilgrimage, because the time is a reference and returned to what the pilgrimage was in the time of his veil, and the peace be upon him.The prayer and peace be upon him in the Hajj of the Hemorne of the Punishment: “Except that time has been the same as his body on the day of God created the heavens and the earth.” (P-142) The judge mentioned a good words in this position, so he said: His exaltation said: So there is no journey, no debauchery, nor a response in the pilgrimage, and it is necessary to be the news of it.As his saying: There is no doubt about it [Al -Amran: 9], meaning that you do not turn in it, and the appearance of the word for the news, so if we carry it on the news, it was with it that the pilgrimage is not from it.Class, but spoil; Because it is like the against it, and it is a prohibition of its health, and on this face the meaning does not evaluate the meaning, except that it is intended by the spoiling gathering for the pilgrimage; Because it spoils the pilgrimage, and the newness is carried on doubt in the pilgrimage and its duty; Because this is an infidel, then the pilgrimage is not valid with it, but we carry these three righteousness on these suffering until it is true that God does not have the truth of this.If it is said: Is it not that with these things, the pilgrimage becomes a corruption, and it is obligatory for his owner to be in it, and if the pilgrimage is remaining with it, he did not believe that the news is not.The pilgrimage, we said: What is meant by the verse is the opposite of the opposite between these things and between the pilgrimage that God has commanded, and that is the argument that is not true.In a manner that it is obligatory to judge, and the corrupt Hajj that must be in which other things are required, only that Hajj, which God has commanded, is the same By the doubt about the pilgrimage, it shows that it does not remain with the work of the pilgrimage; Because that is an infidel, and the pilgrimage is made in Islam, then if we were carried by the word, we are kept on the news.The forbidden, which is in the truth, is noticeable for the appearance of the memorizer, so it is true that it is intended by the gathering, the gathering and its advances and the saying of obscenity, and that it is intended to be intended, and it is intended to be in the same way All its types; Because the memorization is divorced and loyal to all of these sections, so the prohibition of it is forbidden from all its sections, and on this direction, this is like this.Glory, and holding the good morals, and the premise of what the reward of obedience is the reward.The third question: the rule is that God is the highest of this is the three conservatives, neither more nor a decrease, and it is his saying: So there is no journey, no, no, no The mental sciences are that the human being has a powerful power in which he is a thunderous force, and a prestigious angry force, and a powerful force, Mixed, and what is meant is one of all worshiping the three powers, I mean the Shahwiyyah, the anger, and the vicinity, so he said: So there is no manner to the one who is noticeable to the authority of the And his saying: There is no point of significance to the power of the angry power that requires the frequency and the anger, and its saying: There is no sign of a sign to the humiliation of the one who is the one who does The same God, his attributes, his acts, his rulers, and his heavens, and they are the source of a person to dispute the people and their perpetrators, and the violence with them in everything He is counted in these three matters, and there is no crime.The properties of his worshipers are not in it, so there is no way in it, and this is the precious secrets that are the most intense integrity of these verses, so it is not necessary for the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of it Exclusivity in all matters.* * * The following question: One of the people who is a matter of the extension, the search, the look, and the newness, and he embarrassed with its face The newness, and if the newness in the religion was obedience and path to the knowledge of God, the Almighty would not be forbidden in the Hajj, but rather for that estimation, the preoccupation with the new) Obedience, so he was overwhelmed by it.And the second: His Exalted: What they have struck for you, but they are the ones, but they are the people who are deaf [Al -Zakhrif: 58] Their game of their being from the people of the grandfather, and that is the same.And the third of it: it was said: Do not disgust, and shive up and go your wind [Anfal: 46] forbidding the dispute.As for The two speakers are gathered, so they said: The newness in religion is a great obedience, and they needed it with the words It is the best of the bee: 125] and by its words, it is a story about the infidels that they said to the peace be upon him: They said: “We have been brought up, so we have multiplied.” [32] That chant was only to report the principles of religion.If this is proven, then we say: It is necessary to fulfill between these texts, so we carry the slander that is reprehensible to the grandfather in the report of the falsehood, and the demand of money and the ignorance, Reporting the truth and calling the creation to the path of God, and volatility from the religion of God Almighty.As for the saying of the Exalted: What do you do from the best that God knows and provided that the best of the piety is the best of the piety, so know that God is up to be before this And he said: And the pilgrimage and Umrah are completed to God and said: Whoever imposes the Hajj in them and forbids what is evil and disobedience, and he said: So, there is no puff, no, no, no You did from the best that God knows, and it was the first in the phenomenon to be said: and what you do from something that God knows, until all of the goodness will be given, and the goodness is that the good is, The best that God knows it is for the people and the people: one of them: if I knew from you the best, I remember him and his famousness, and if I knew from you, I will be hidden from you; Let you know that if you have mercy on you in this world, then how can he be in the heart.And the second: that one of the interpreters is the one who said in the interpretation of his saying: The hour is coming, I almost hide it [Taha: 15] with it: If I could not hide it from it This is the verse, as if it was said to the servant: what he does from the best of his knowledge, and as for the one who does it from evil, if I could not hide it from your soul.And the third of it: that the great Sultanate, if he says to his obedient servant: everything that you bear from the types of hardship and servitude in my right, for I am a scholar, and I have it, and it is for him, With the great rewards, even if he said to his servant, the ritual singer, he was a promise to the hard punishment, and when the truth was the one who is the most generous of the rituals, there is no male.The promise of the reward, and he did not remember what is indicated by the return.And the one who has been: Jabriel, peace be upon him, when he said: What is charity?The Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Charity is to worship God as if you see him, for if you did not see him, then he will see it.” It does it from the good; Let the servant obey the Lord of the charity, which is the highest degree of worship, is that the servant knows that his servant is lonely upon him I keep working on work, more than him, and least an alienation from him.Fifth: that if the servant knows that the servant is informed of all his conditions and what he does, his grandfather and his douring in the performance of obedience and in the outstanding of the banner were not more Likewise, so that this is the one who followed the end of the pilgrimage and the forbidden from the spoil, the debauchery, and the roar of its saying: What do you do from the best of God.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: and they are provided that the best of the piety is in it, so they say: one of them: that what is meant is: and they are provided with piety, and the evidence is upon him: The best of the piety and the verification of the words is in it that the human being has a travel: (P-144) is a travel in the world, and a travel from the world, so the travel in the world is not from the world, and it is not necessary for it.The compound and the money, and the travel of the world, must also be of more, and it is the knowledge of God and his love and the symptoms of what is it It saves you from the torment of dough, and increased the hereafter, saves you from a burning torment.And the second: that the world has increased the world, which broke you from a severe torment, and increased the hereafter, and it will save you from a constant torment.And the third of it: that the world has increased the world, it connects you to a pleasant, with the pain, shrines, and ears, and the hereafter increased, bringing you to the remaining remaining, pure from the districts of the harmful And the ritual.And the one who has increased it: that it increased the world, which is every hour in the manifestations and the elimination, and the hereafter increased, bringing you to the hereafter, which is every hour in the turnout, kinship and communication.Fifth: that the world has increased the world, it connects you to the lust and soul.If you know this, let us go back to the interpretation of the verse, as if he is up to the Almighty, he said: When you have proven that the best of the piety is the piety, then they would be able to meet me, my first people Those who know the truths of the affairs, and you must have the right of your mind and your heart is to be able to get this overburden, because it is in it, and he said that there is a lot of it.Meaning: If you do not leave with the increase in the patent and you will meet after the death, you have provided that you did not The second: That this verse was descended in people from the people of Yemen, who were pilgrimage to others, and they said: We are reluctant, then they were asking the people, And God commanded them to provide them with goodness, and he said: And provide what you are informed of; For the best of the increase is what you are sufficient for you and your faces from the question and yourself of the darkness; And on the authority of Ibn Zaid: that the tribes of the Arabs were forbidden to increase in Hajj and Umrah, and they were revealed.Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri narrated On the authority of Ibn Umar, he said: If they were forbidden and with them, they would have threw it with it, so they would have been from that of this verse.His saying: And they were provided, and it was appreciated: they were provided with piety, and piety in the knowledge of the law and the Qur’an is a dilemma of the work of the obligations, and he said: تَصْحِيحَ هَذا القَوْلِ فَفِيهِ وجْهانِ: أحَدُهُما: أنَّ القادِرَ عَلى أنْ يَسْتَصْحِبَ الزّادَ في السَّفَرِ إذا لَمْ يَسْتَصْحِبْهُ عَصى اللَّهَ في ذَلِكَ, فَعَلى هَذا الطَّرِيقِ صَحَّ Its entry under the verse.The second: to be in the words, and to be the intention: and provide for the speed of your travel and for the sake, for the good of the piety.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: and you fear that it is: the first question: his saying: and you fear that he alerts him on the same as the greatness of God and His Majesty: The stars and my hair are the second question: Abu Umar attributed the ya in his saying: and fear the origin of the original, and the other deleted it to reduce and the calamity.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: and you fear my first people, so know that the door of the thing and his father is the pure of it, then they disagreed after that, (p-145) said: For reason; Because he honored what is in the human being, and whom the human being distinguishes from the Bahaim and is close to the arrogance of the angels, and he returned to him for the distinction between the good of the good, and he said: In the original, it is a name for the heart that is the place of the mind, and the heart may make a fennel from the mind, the Almighty said: That is in the male of those who have been for whom he has a little [Q: 37] So we have made the pulp from the mind, so he said it: And you fear, my first, the doors, with it: O first minds, and release the name of the case, It is said to those who have others and protective: so that there is a soul for him, and for whom he has no fever: so and so we do not have a soul for him, so we are so.If it is said: If the speech of the mind is only valid, then what is in his saying: and fear my first people.We said: It is that you are what you were among the first people, you were able to know these things and work with them, so it was upon you, and it is for you, and it is for you, and it is for you.الشّاعِرُ: ؎ولَمْ أرَ في عُيُوبِ النّاسِ شَيْئًا كَنَقْصِ القادِرِينَ عَلى التَّمامِ ولِهَذا قالَ تَعالى: أُولَئِكَ كالأنْعامِ بَلْ هم أضَلُّ [الأعْرافِ: 179] يَعْنِي الأنْعامُ مَعْذُورَةٌ بِسَبَبِ العَجْزِ, As for these Qadruns, their symptoms were obscene, so they were not lost.
