The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of it, will be avoided: it will be avoided by the one who comes to his money, and what no one has a blessing that will be rewarded with the meaning that will be avoided, that is: it will be made, and it will be made from it and will be made from it.The thing has gone away, that is: I did it and spare it from it, and it has two questions: the first question: the assembly of those who are among us is that the one who wants it is the one who is good.And know that the Shiites, with their families, denounce this narration, and say: It has come down in the right of Ali, the son of Abi, who is upon him, peace be upon him, peace be upon him.Zakat while they are pious [Al -Ma’idah: 55] and his saying: The righteous who pays his money is a zakat of reference to the verse from his saying: they will pay zakat while they are pious, and they are not.I said: The mentality is evaluated that what is meant by this verse is Abu Bakr, and its report: that what is meant by this ritual is the best of creation, so if it is like that, then it is like that.What is meant is the father of Bakr, so the two lists are the validity of the intended.And the honor is the best, so it indicates that everyone who was feared must be better, because it was said: the verse indicated that everyone who was a generosity was that I had, and that is not that it was not.Say: The description of the one of the human being is a male who is a timer, and the description of his being is more than one knowing and no viewer, and the one who is known is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one He reflected it, so it is a beneficial, so the inclusion of the verse is as if the suspicion of the suspicion was that the honor is with God who is?It was said: It is the righteous, and if it was like that, the estimation will be perished, I will honor you with God, then it was proven that the one who is mentioned is the one that is necessary, and it is more than the best of the creation.It must be the one who is intended for Abu Bakr; Because the nation is collected on the preference of creation after the Messenger of God, either Abu Bakr or Ali, and it is not possible to carry this verse on the authority of my son On my father, Bakr, but he said: It is not possible to carry it on Ali ibn Abi Taleb because he said in the adjective of this rhetoric: and no one has a gray of this Approaching Ali Bin Abi Taleb;
