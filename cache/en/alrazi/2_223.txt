The Quranic researcher (P-61) The eighth judgment is your abuse of you.Your misfortune is a plow for you, and you will come to your plow that you will come and offer to yourself and fear God and know that you are met with the good people of the believers in the verse: Because of the descent, it is a face: one of them: “It was narrated that the Jews said: Whoever is universed in his kisses from her custodians was her son, he was hidden, and they claimed that this is in that For the Messenger of God ﷺ He said: The Jews lied.And the second: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, “Omar came to the Prophet ﷺ He said: O Messenger of God, I have been destroyed.” And the third of it: the supporters were denying that the man came from her arrangement in her kisses, and they took that from the Jews, and a Quraysh was doing that On them, the verse was revealed.* * * The second question: a plow for you any treasures and a siblings for a child, and this is on the way to the likeness, so the way is like the land, and the sperm, like the sperm.And the plow is a source, and this is the limit of the plow, so the meaning was your misfortune, with the plow, in which you are plowing for a child, so the added, and the one who has been said, In the name of the thing on the way of the exaggeration as his saying: ؎ But it is an infection and angels and it is said: This is the matter of God, that is, his affairs, and this is a lust, so that it is a matter The man is his plow.* * * The third question: the most of the scholars went to the fact that what is meant by the verse is that the man is a choice between her kisses in her kisses, and between her kisses, and between her coming from her, from her kisses, and between her from her coming from her His saying: (I am a thing) is a proof of that, and a fool was transmitted from Ibn Omar that he was saying: What is meant by the verse is the convergence of the people of the people in the people of the Water in this narration, and this is the saying of your money, and the choice of the master is satisfied with the Shiites, and it is satisfied with his narration from Jaafar bin Muhammad al -Sadiq, who is the one who is pleased with him It is not permissible for the women in their ads from his faces: the first pilgrimage: that God Almighty said in the verse of the menstruation: Say: He is a harmful, and they disgraced the women in the menstruation.The place of harm, and there is no meaning for harm except what the human being hurts from, and here the human being hurts the daughter of the lights of that blood.And the obtaining of this cause in the place of the conflict is the appearance, then if that reason is based on this, then the prohibition must be obtained.The second pilgrimage: His exalted saying: So they came to them from where God commands you and the appearance of the matter of the obligatory, and it cannot be said: He is alienated, and they will be repeated.Because that is not obligatory, so he must carry it on that What is meant is that whoever comes to the woman must (P-62) come to her in that position that God has commanded, and then this is not the same as the proof; Because this is unanimous, and it is necessary to be the proof of kisses, and that is the one who is required.The third pilgrimage: The Khuziya ibn Thabat narrated, “A man asked the Prophet ﷺ about the women of the women in their ads.That is, the two times, or in any of the two consequences, or in any two rows, the security of its kisses in its kisses, then it is yes, the security of its arches in its kisses, then it is safe for it, so it is the security of it.He is ashamed of the truth: “Do not come to women in their families.Al -Kharaz, I was about it from the dead, and also the one of their saying: I saved the skin if I preached it.The pilgrimage of the one who said in the parallel is a face: the first pilgrimage: holding this verse from two voices: the first: that the exalted is he who made the plow a name for the woman, so he said: On that the plow is a name for the woman, not for the appointed place, and when he said after it: So they came to your plow that you were the intention, so I will come to you, so I will come to you.They are on all the faces, so he enters the place of the conflict.The second face: that the word (me) is with whom, God Almighty said: I have this, I said it is from God [Al -Amran: 37] and the estimation: from where is this for you, this So, where are you?If this is proven, then he says: It appears that it is not possible to carry the verse on the two kisses in its kisses, or from its rituals in its kisses; Because on this place is one of the places, and the supply was located in the way of the two, and the extensive memorization of it is to say: they go to it, how are you?For the memorization: How, but a word (Ana) and it is proven that the word (Ana) is a sense of release between the place, it is not possible that it is not what you mentioned.The second pilgrimage to them: the one who has the general saying of it: except for their waves, or what their faith possesses [the believers: 6], the action is left in the right of the right to the right of the right to the right of So he must be worked in the right to the human.The third pilgrimage: We agreed on that if he said to the woman: I have a forbidden to me and intend to divorce that it will be divorce, and this is required for it, so that it is a shame for it The words of the people in this section.The first replied and they said: Who indicates that it is not permissible for what is meant by this verse is the women who are not coming Wajoh: The first: that the plow is a name for the position of plowing, and it is known that what is meant by all its parts is not a place for the lament, so it is forbidden, so it is forbidden.The woman, and this indication is required to give the memorization of the plow to the same woman, except that we left the work with this evidence in his saying: your misfortune is that you are a good man.Here, by release the cure of the plow on the same woman, we carried that on the famous metaphor from the name of all things in the name of its part, and this is the one in the name His saying: So they came to your plow, and it is obligatory to carry the plow, here we are on the position of plowing on the threats, so it was proven that the verse is not a sign of it except for the one.(P-63) The second face: In Bayan that this verse cannot be indicative of what they mentioned; When we have indicated that what was before this verse indicates the prohibition from what they mentioned from two faces: one of them: his saying: Say it is more.And the second: His saying: So they came to them from where God is your command Decomposition is in one position, and the origin is that it is not permissible.The third face: the famous narratives that the descent of this verse is disturbed by that it is permissible for it to be in its kisses, and the reason for the revelation The verse, so the time of the verse is in terms of this image, and when we carried it on this image, there was no need for us to carry it on the image The faces are that what is meant by the verse is not what they mentioned, and when this is searching for the faces that they have been held on to detail: As for the first face: So they plowed with it: so they came to the place of the plow.As for the second: It is when it was intended to plow in his saying: So they plowed that the appointed place, and it was not pregnant (that you will be).It is added to it, which is that what is meant is from (I am something) and it is added to the memorizer: He carried the memorization of the plow on the woman on the way of the metaphor, so that this guarantee is not obligated to say: but this is the first; Because the origin is in the ritual humor.As for the third, his answer: that his saying: except for their husbands or what their faith has [the believers: 6] year, and our evidence is in particular, and the private is presented to the year.As for the lord: his answer: that his saying: I have a forbidden to me, but it is reconciled to be as a result of divorce; Because it is a place for the dissolution of the mobility and the dormitory, so it became like his saying: Your hand is divorced, and God knows.The loyal question: the interpreters differed in the interpretation of his saying: (I am something) and the famous what we mentioned is that it is permissible for the husband that She comes from her kisses in her kisses, and from her kisses.The second: that the meaning: that is, the time you are from the solutions of the solution: it means if it is not foreigner, prohibited, forth, or a menstruating woman.The third: It is permissible for a man to marry her, a place, a blessing, or a rumor, after being in the vagina.Al -Rabaa: Ibn Abbas said: The meaning is isolated, and if he wants, he will not be isolated, and he is transmitted from Saeed bin Al -Masib.Fifth: When did you want from night or day.If it was said: What is the choice of these people?We said: It was appeared about the interpreters that the descent of this verse was that the Jews were saying: Whoever comes to the woman from her kiss in her kiss came, the father came to the one who is the same To deny their saying, then the first was carried by the word on it, and as for the obstacles, he did not enter it in this section; Because (me) will be in the sense of (dead) and be in the sense of (how), and the isolation and its condolences will not enter the (Anna); Because the state of the intercourse is not different from that, then there is no face to carry the words except for what we said.As for his saying: And lead to yourself, so it is: Do what you have to do with paradise and generosity, and his counterpart is to say the man to others: Good, and it is like it: and they are provided that the best of the piety is [the cow: 197] and a counterpart (P-64)) His saying: They said, but you do not welcomes you, you presented it to us, and the misery of the decision [p.: 60].If it was said: How do these words be attached to what before it?We said: We are quoted from Ibn Abbas that he said: The name is with the name of the unanimity, and it is in the end of the distance, and in which I have the saying that his saying: On the basis of the permissibility of slowness, as if it was said: These are the human beings, but the law judged by the pornography of you for you for the sake of being a plow for you; That is, because the child generates from it, then he said after him: So they will come to you that you are something: that is, when the reason was permitted and rested it for you, and they will not come to you.It is not the place of the plow, so it was his saying: So they came to your plow as a sign of the ear in that place, and it is forbidden for that, so the place, so that the place is in the place, so the place is in the place, so the place is the one who is the one who is the place, so the place is in the place of the place, so the place is the one who is the one who is the place, so the place is the one who is the place, so the One of the two places, and the prohibition of the other position, does not make a crime.The Almighty confirmed that by saying: (Fear God) Then he confirmed it third with his saying: Know that you are met, and this is the threats of the three of the three, if it is not the same, if it is not the same, if it is not the same.It is forbidden to forbid something that is not distorted, and it was proven that what was before this verse is indicative of the prohibition of this work, and what is also a sign of it, as well The correct gold is interpreted This verse is what the Mujahids had gone to.As for his words, the Exalted: Fear God and know that you are met, so know that the words in piety may be presented, and the words in the interpretation of the meeting of God, may God bless him.They think that they are their Lord [Al -Baqarah: 46] and know that he is the highest of this three things: the first: the first: and give it to yourself and the intended of it.And the second: His saying: (Fear God), and what is meant by him is to leave the prohibitions.And the third of it: his saying: and know that you are met, and there is a sign that I have assigned you to carry the hardships in the act of obedience and the leaving of the prohibitions for the sake of the day And the calculation, had it not been for that day that the hardship would be lamented in the act of obedience and the conversation of the banners in vain, and what is good is this tranquility, then he said: And he said: The sponsorship of the one who is considered the one who is considered in the Qur’an, which is to make it with every Eid and a promise, and the meaning: and the good of the believers, especially with the reward and the dignity, so that it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same.He became like his saying: He preached the believers that they have a great preference [Al -Ahzab: 47].
