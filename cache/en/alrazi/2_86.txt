The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: Those who have bought the worldly life by the hereafter, so the torment is not relieved of them, nor are they victorious.And for the hereafter, it is not unable to be unable, and God will be given the cost of the cost of the asset, whichever is, and he wanted, and if he works with the same We himself, so God made what was presented to him from faith in what is in their books and what he obtained in their hands from the infidels and the infrastructure of the world, such as the sacrifice, and the sacrifice, They have that those who are stubborn in the sale and the purchase in the world are defamed until it is described that it is changed in his mind, so that the bodies of the world will be vilified.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: The torment is not relieved of them, so he has two questions: the first question: in the entry of fulfillment in his saying: it is not reduced to the saying: Participate and the other saying in the sense of the answer to the matter, as you say that the first of the misfortune is that it is not better for them, and the first is his face because there is no need in it.The second question: Some of them carry the lowering that he does not cut off, but he is sleep And the first thing is that the torment may be afraid of the feud and may be reduced by the few in (P-1660) every time or in some of the facts, so if it is described, the torment of it is not the same All what we mentioned.As for his saying, â€œThey are not victorious, and they are in his face and Jahan: the most, they carry it on the negation of the victory in the hereafter, it means that one of them does not pay this torture from them, nor is they from the torment of them, nor are they from the torment of them.Their torment, and among them is those who carried it on the negation of the victory in the world, and the first is the first because it is the highest that made it a reward for their work The adjective is only suitable for the hereafter, because the torment of the world, and if it is obtained, it becomes like the limits that are established on the palace, and because the infidels may become a person in The leaks.
