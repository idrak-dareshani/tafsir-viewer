The researcher of the Qur’an: We have sent us the Qur’an to you, I know that they were shown in the beginning When the forever was not mentioned [the human: 1] Then he showed that he was created by his creation, and what is meant by him is either as a creature from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The fourth, or from the water of the man and the woman, or from the members and the lives, or from the body (P-227) and the soul, or from the difficult conditions of that body, like the same Then chew and then bones, and on any of these faces, this verse is carried, so this is indicated that it is necessary from the foolishness of the deceased.Then, after that, I did not create it as a void, unemployed, but I created it for the sake of the luminous and the two of the two, and the sign of it is: The great specialty between the people of algebra and al -Qaddar, then the Almighty mentioned that I gave him all what he needs with the lameness and the grace, and he is the one who is the one, and the gossip, and it is Referring to his saying: So we made it a visible hearing [man: 2] And when the mind was the honor of the things that need it in this section, he turned away from the hearing and the insight, so he said: Then he showed that the creation after these conditions became two sections; Some of them are thankful, and among them is infidels, and this division by choosing them is as it is the interpretation of the estimation, or from God for what is the interpretation of al -Jabriya, then it is the one The dismissal, then he mentioned after that the reward of those who are obedient to the exclusion, and he said: and your endeavor was grateful.He knew that the dismissal is in the remembrance of the punishment with the sofa in the explanation of the reward indicates that the side of the mercy is mostly and stronger, so it appeared from what we have indicated that the surah is from this The hereafter, and then it is the Almighty after that in the conditions of the world, and the explanation of the conditions of the obedients came to the explanation of the conditions of the people, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, The Messenger is the head and the president, for this is the Messenger of the Messenger.He knew that the speech is either the forbidden or the matter, then it is the Almighty before the excess while it is related to the Messenger from the forbidden and the matter, it is presented in the way of the ritual.And the obscenity is about his mind, but that he did that because the preoccupation with obedience and the creation of the costs is not fulfilled only with the emptiness of the heart, then this is the same He forbade him from some things, then after the emptiness on the forbidden, he mentioned his command with some things, but the forbidden came to the matter, because the payment of the ritual is no A lodged to get what He is overwhelmed, then he is the Almighty after that, the conditions of the people and the disbelievers on what will come to be detailed with his two years, and whoever contemplates what he mentioned is that we know it On the best of the faces of the structure and the regime, the praise of God who enlightened the mind of this weak holder with these lights, and has the thanks to him.Let us go back to interpretation, so we say: As for that presenter, it is the saying of the Almighty: We are our descending from you the Qur’an, and I know that the one is from the one The Messenger and his chest were fixed as they attributed it to him from the priesthood and magic, so God mentioned the Almighty that this is a neighborhood from God, so there is no crime with the ritual of the ritual.Because you confirm the affirmation of the most abundant, as if it is the Almighty saying: If these infidels say: That is a priesthood, then I am the king of the truth.And the exaggeration: that is a right alive, and a ritual download from me.This has two benefits: one of them: the removal of the advanced obscenity that has the causes of those who are affected by these disbelievers; For some ignorance, and if they stabbed it, it is the mighty of the heavens, its greatness and sincerity.And the second: its strength is to carry the future and the future.That is because the infidels were overwhelming in harming him, and he wanted their fighter, so when God commanded him to be patient with that of that harm and the leaving of the fighters, and it was for that We have revealed the Qur’an to you, as if he said to him: I have not revealed to you this Qur’an with a separation, except for the ruling of the language.With a certain time, and that wisdom has been delayed the late permission in the fighting, so be patient with the ruling of your Lord (P-228), who is the one who is ruling from the ruling And messing and falsehood.Then it is the Almighty when this presenter came to the forbidden, and he said: So be patient with the ruling of your Lord and do not obey them as sin or disbelief
