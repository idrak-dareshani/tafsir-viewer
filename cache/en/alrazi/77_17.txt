The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Did we not kill the first and then follow the others, as well This image is eliminating the infidels, and warning them of the infidels.The first type of disagreement is that it was divided on that the day they promise to him while he was the day of the chapter and signed, then he said: What is the most aware of the day And the day of the lying.And the second type of disagreement: what is mentioned in this verse, which is that it is the family of the disbeliever who is advanced by their disbelief, then if the disbelievers are in the past It must be destroyed as well, then he said: And the day of the day for the lying is as if it says: As for the world, they are the one who is destroyed, and the last is the torment, With his saying: the loss of the world and the hereafter is the loss shown [Hajj: 11] and in the two questions: The first: What is meant by the first and the others?The answer: It is in it: The first: that it is your first family from the people of Noah, returned, and then the others followed by the people of the people of the people, the people of the people, and the people, as well The disbelievers of Quraysh, and this is a weak saying; Because his saying: We follow the others with the memorials of the horrific, so it is the case and the future and the past does not take the past.The second saying: that what is meant by the first of all the infidels who were before Muhammad ﷺ, and his saying: Then we follow the others on the one We will do that and follow the last, and it will be referred to as the rule of Abdullah's readers: That is indicated by the consent in “Mum”, and then the one who is intended for the past is not the future, our saying: The firm reader with the frequency: It is required, and if the readers were required to be with the reward, the past is the past, the inconsistency between the two readings, and it is not permissible.We knew that the eye is not for the eye, but rather to be afraid, as it was narrated in the house of the Qayyis: He does with the late ones, such as what is done with those who are present.To be a criminant, for a blindness in all of the criminals; Because the general (P-240) is the cause of the rule.* * * Then the Almighty said: And the day of the day for the lies, that is: these, even if they are destroyed and tormented in the world, so the great calamity and the greatest slander.The second question: What is meant by the property in its saying: Did we not the first of the first people who are the divorce of death or death with torment?If that was the first Female for atonement; Because this is an issue that has the believer and the infidel, then it does not reconcile a warning to the disbeliever, and if the one who wants is the second, which is the death of the torment, then he said: Likewise, we do the criminals, it is necessary for God to have, and he did the atonement of a Quraysh, such as that Let them torture them and you are in them.It is not permissible for what is intended for the property to be a third of the two things, which are the one who mentioned the two things that they mentioned.Those who are advanced to their warning to the world, they stubbornly disobeyed the prophets, and then they died, so they missed the world and the rest of the curse on them in the world The other is always smiling, so this is the case of these unbelievers, and it is known that the same is the word of the greed of the mine.
