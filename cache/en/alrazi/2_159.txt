The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: Those who assume what we have revealed from the evidence and guidance after what it has shown to people in the book, those who curse them and God curses them and curses them and curses them Institutions: The first question: in his saying: Those who assure say.One of them: It is a tone of the words that all those who have come from religion.The second: that he does not run on his appearance in the general and then one of those who claimed that he is in special Juda The descriptions of the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him - and from the rulings, so they were hidden, and the verse was revealed, and it was said: I came down in the people of the book from the Juda and the Christians, on the authority of Ibn, and the son of the son, And the mortality, the rabid, the Saddi, and the deaf.The first is close to righteousness to his faces: one of them: that the memorization is general, and the exhibitors are supplied, and it is its descent when it is a certain reason that requires the privileges of what is proven The crossing is in general, not with the privacy of the causes.And the second: that it has also been proven in the origins of jurisprudence, that the ruling on the description is felt, as the description is a cause for that judgment, not if the description is not.It was doubted that (P-148) is the religion of religion, which is caused by the investigation of the curse from God Almighty, and if this description is a cause for this judgment, then this is a general.And the third of it: that a group of companions carried this memorial to the general, and on the authority of Aisha - may God be pleased with her - that she said: Whoever claims that he is the one who is peace and peace be upon him Live, the greatest of the paradise is upon God, and God Almighty says: Those who assume what we have revealed from the sons and guidance, so the verse is done on the authority of the uncle About him - he said: If only two things from the book of God, I did not happen in a hadith after the people said: The abundance of Abu Hurairah.And read: Those who conceal what we have revealed from the evidence and the guidance and the one who specializes in the verse in the people of the book, is that the killing is only valid for from them on the basis of the Prophet, peace be upon him - As for the Qur’an, it is frequent, so it is not valid for its kings, we said: The Qur’an is before its freshness, and it is correct.The one is true of his kiss, and so is the saying, while the cost needs it from the mental evidence.The second question: The judge said: The killing is left to show off the thing with the need for it, and the call of the supplicant to its purification; Because when it was not like that, it was not a secretary, so when what God has revealed from the sons and guidance is one of the most severe of what he is in the debt, and he described those who know him, and he did not know.One of our worlds describes the affairs of the world, if it is strengthening the reasons Its appearance, and on this direction, he praises those who appreciate the secret of the secret; Because the mortality is what is stalked on the soul.* * * The third question: This verse indicates that what is connected to the debt and needs the cost to it, it is not permissible for him to be assured, and whoever has fulfilled it, then he has lost it.This verse is the Almighty saying: When God took the covenant of those who have given the book to show it to people and do not assault it [Al -Imran: 187] and the close of them: They assure what God has revealed from the book and buy a little thues to it [Al -Baqarah: 174] This is all of it is due to the emergence of the sciences of religion, and it will be given to the people, And its counterpart in the two knowledge of knowledge, even if it is not in it the remembrance of the return to its calamity, its saying is up to the Almighty: If only a group of them would be repelled, and they would not be a sect in which they will be lost in the religion.If they return to them, they may warn them.A glorious of fire.As for the saying of the Exalted: What we have revealed from the sons, so what is meant by all what was revealed to the prophets is a book and a revelation without the evidence of the mind Mental and Transportation; Because we have been explained in the interpretation of his Almighty saying: a guidance for those who are righteous [Al -Baqarah: 3] that guidance is a sign of evidence, so that all of it is said: He said: He said: For people in the book, he returned to the first direction.He knew that the book, when it indicated that the one who told the one, the consensus, and the measurement is a pilgrimage, for all that is indicated by one of these things, so the book was indicated, so the book was made.The verse, and you have proven that he was the highest of the hearing of evidence and the mentality and gathered between the two things in the return, so this is the one who does not say that Religion with mental evidence for those who needed it, then left it or a bit of the rulings of the law with the severity of the need for it, so it was not true.The following question: This appearance is a pleasure on the sufficiency, not to be aware, and this is because if some appear, then every one can be able to do so It is cruel, and if it is removed from the end of the killing, the rest is not obligatory to appear again.(P-149) Fifth question: One of the people who includes these verses in the acceptance of the news of the one, and he said: These verses indicate that the emergence of these rulings, and the rulings of the rulings Doing it, it was not obligatory, and the decree is complete in which it is said to be the highest in the last of the verse: except those who repented and reconciled and built [Al -Baqarah: 160] With their experience, I am It was said: Why is it not permissible for every one to be forbidden from the killing, and commanded by the two people; Let the experts abound, and the frequency of the news?We said: This is a mistake because they are not forbidden by the killing except for those who are permissible for them to be the killing, and whoever is permissible for them to be overwhelmed by the mortality, it is permissible for them to be overlooked, They are not informed of knowledge.* * * The sixth question: take this verse that it is not permissible to take the reward for learning; Because the verse when it was indicated by the duty of that learning, it was taken for the reward for it to take the reward for the performance Those who conceal what God has revealed from the book and buy it a few thues to a few [Al -Baqarah: 174] and the appearance of that is forbidden Because his saying: They buy a few for a few years, which is forbidden to take the substance from all the faces.As for the saying of the Exalted: After what he has shown to people in the book before in Al -Tawara and Al -Najil from the attribute of Muhammad ﷺ, and from the rulings, and it was said: He wanted the first house The advanced, and the second: what is in the Qur’an.As for the saying of the Almighty: Those are cursed by God, so the curse is in the origin of the language is the dimension, and in the knowledge of the ostrich of the reward.As for the saying of the exalted: and those who cursed them, they must be carried on those who have a effect, and they have agreed on that the angels and the righteous are like the angels and the righteous Inside this general, there is no referral, and the words of His Excellency are confirmed: those who disbelieve and died while they are disbelievers, those upon them, the curse of God 161] The people mentioned the most important faces: one of them: that the curses are the animals of the earth and their inhabitants, so they say: We are forbidden by the country with my sins, the sons of Adam, and he said: The cursed, and the cousins ​​did not say that it is the highest and described it with a description of those who are reasonable, so the collection of those who are reasonable as his saying: and the sun and the moon: [4] The pool, enter your silence [Ants: 18], and they said to their hearts, why did you testify to us [Chapter: 21], and each in a king who praises [Yass: 40].And the second: Everything except the two giggles of jinn and mankind, if it was said: How is the curse be corrected from the Bahas and the camels?We said: On the authority of two sides: the first: on the path of the exaggeration, which is that if it was sane, it would be cursed.The second: It is in the hereafter if it is repeated and made from the minds, then it curses those who did that in the world and died on it.And the third of it: that the people of the fire cursed them as well, where the religion is fulfilled, so it is on the general.And its booster: Ibn Masoud said: If the two ads are cursed, the curse is on the one who deserves it, then it is not a fulfillment, and it is back on it Glory to him And exalted.Fifth: On the authority of Ibn Abbas: They have two curses: the curse of God, and the cursing of the virtuous.He said: If a man puts in his grave, he will ask: What is your religion?Who is your Prophet?Who is your Lord?He says: I do not know, and he will be struck by a war that is heard by everything except the two giggles of humanity and hengs, so nothing will hear his voice except for his curse, and he says: You were in the world.And its sixth: The father of a Muslim said: (The cursed) are those who believe in it, and the meaning of the cursing of them: the end of the (P-150) who is fabricated and its hardships, and its disagreement with it.From it.The judge said: The verse indicated that this killing is from the cabarets; Because he is the highest in which the curse is obligatory, and it indicates that one of the prophets did not have what was carried from the message, otherwise it was inside the verse.
