The Qur’anic researcher, the sixth ruling, O you who believe, have been written for you, as it was written on those before you, so that you may fear.The Almighty said: O you who believe, have been written on you, as it was written on those before you, so that you may fear.Know that fasting is a source of fasting, as is the rule, and the origin of it in the language is the reason for the thing and the leaving it for it, and from it it was said to the silence: a fast for the sake of the words of God: I vowed to the Most Merciful, fasting [Maryam: 26] and the fast of the day if it is adjusted and the existing standard of the side, the commander of the Qais said: “He will be called it, and he said that it is the day of the day.” ؎ If the day fasts, the wind fasted, and the wind fasted if it is raised, and the Persians fast if it rises on the other hand, and the jungle said: ؎ Fitness is fasting and an imaginative, and it is not good.The glow is said: a fasting bush if it rises, then it does not come, the ritual said: ؎ The rituals are the fasting evil and the fasting of the sun, where it is equal to the day of the day.Al -Najim, the prince of Al -Qais said: As if the richness was suspended in its fasting ∗∗∗ with the heads of kits to the deafness of Gandal, this is the meaning of fasting in the language, and in the validity, it is from the omission that is from The sun is on the breakfast, the state of knowledge, as it is a fasting with the abundance of the intention.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: as it was written on those before you, in it, two questions: the first question: in this similarity, say: one of them is the one who is a good thing: it is a good thing: This is the meaning of the worship, it was a boundary and a duty on the prophets and the nations from Adam to your covenant, what God has given a nation from their affirmation of them, and he does not do so, and this is not for you Speech is that fasting is hard worship, and the arduous thing if it is easy to bear it.(P-60) And the second saying: that the likeness goes back to the time of fasting and to its destiny, and this is weak; Because the thing is similar to the thing, it requires their leveling in a matter Wooh: One of them: God Almighty imposed the fast of Ramadan on Jews and Christians, but the Jews, it has left this month and is fasting one day from the Sunnah, so they are the good of the Sunnah.Pharaoh, and lied in that as well; Because this day, on the day of Ashura, on the tongue of the Messenger of God ﷺ, as for the Christians, they fasted Ramadan, and they went beyond the freedom, so they turned to him, and they said to him, and they did not.Conversation: We increase in it, and they increased ten years, then after a time, they complained about their king, so he warned seven and increased it, and then came after that, the king of another said: Fifths were blessed by one day, and this is the meaning of his Almighty saying: Take their mobility and their downs as the heads [Repentance: 31] and this is narrated from good.And the second: that they took the documentation for a long time, and they were fasting before the thirty day and after it one day, then the last did not seek to the Sunnah One day, and this is the fast of the day of suspicion, and it is narrated from the people.And the third of it: that the face of the likeness is that it is forbidden for food, drink, and intercourse after the sleep, as this was forbidden to the path of the nations, and the one who said that the one who said that the saying is that That his saying is the Almighty: I will be permissible for you for the night of fasting to your women.This likeness, which is his saying: As it was written on those before you, then this likeness is an indication of the evidence of this meaning, he said: It is clear that something like it with something that does not indicate their similarities from all the faces, so it was not necessary from our likeness to our fast, and that they will be blessed.Their fast is estimated at thirty one day, then this narration is what is repeated from the acceptance of Islam if he knows Judy and the Christians, as it is like that.The second question: in the position (as) three sayings: The first: Al -Zajaj said: Mawzan "as" as a patch on the source; Because the meaning: it was imposed on you as a refusal, such as those who were imposed on those before you.Al -Thani: Ibn Al -Anbari said: It is permissible to be in the position of a position in the case of fasting that is meant by it: the fast is written on you, similar and represented by what you have.The third: Abu Ali said: It is a characteristic of a minorly exported source: a book as he was written on them, so the source is omitted and he said: The breadth and the deletion are their saying in the sake of divorce: you are one, and they want you to be a single divorce, so the additive and the added to it and the sake of the sake of the addition of the addition of the addition of the addition To me.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: Perhaps you will fear, know that you will explain “to perhaps” in the right of God, may God bless you Wahwah: One of them: that he is groaning in this words that fasting inherits piety because it is in it from the breaking of the desire and the conjunction of the passion, for it is the one who is more than the one, and it is the one who will be lost It is inspired by the self and its descendants, and that; Because the fast is broken by the lust of the stomach and the vagina, but the people seek for these, as it was said in the bright likeness: the woman seeks to his neighbor with his stomach So whoever has more fasting is upon him the command of these two and their insults were afraid of them, so that was deterred by him from the composition of the incest and the people of the The world, and that is a gather The righteous who have eaten them in my book, and I knew that this book was guided to them and when the fast was summed up with this special, it is good for you to say that it is good for you You fear it on the face of (P-61) and its meal; Because what prevents the soul is from tin, it is necessary to be obligatory.And the second: the meaning is to you with the fasting to strengthen your coming in piety, and this is the meaning of “perhaps”.And the third of it: the meaning: Perhaps you will fear God with your goodness and leave you for lusts, for the thing is the more desire in it, the more righteous, the ritual of it, the ritual of it, and the ritual of it, And it is more intense than the desire in the birds of things, so if the fear of God is easier for you to bless the righteous and the disobedience, the fear of God was the blessing of the paths of things.And the one who has been seen: What is meant is written on you, as it was written on those before you, so that you may fear its streams and leave the preservation on it by the greatness of it.Fifthly: Perhaps you will continue with the cause of this worship in the righteousness of the righteous; Because the fast is their slogan, and God knows.
