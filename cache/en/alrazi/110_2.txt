The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: I saw people enter the religion of God in which there are questions: the first question: you saw that it will be that it is with the insight, and that you are, and you will be with the insight.It was with the insight, and they were entering in the place of the monument in the case, and the appreciation: and you saw the people if they entered the religion of God, and if it was with it, it was with the knowledge of it.A second effective, you may know, and the appreciation: You taught people inside the religion of God.The second question: it appears to be the people of the public, and it is necessary that all people be entered into the existence of the existence with the fact that the matter was not like that?The answer is from two voices: The first: that the intended is from humanity and mind, but it is religion and obedience, according to what he said: I did not create gin and humanity except to worship, and whoever worshiped the one who is the one On the infidels, as if it is not a human being, and this meaning is what is meant by his saying: Those are like a year, but they are the best [Al -A'raf: 179] and he said: And if he said to them, they believe in: Peace be upon him: Who are the people?He said: We are the people, and our people liken the people, and our enemies are the people, so he accepted him, peace be upon him, between his eyes, and he said: God knows best, They entered Islam after a long time and a lot of shortening, so how do they deserve this great praise?We said: This has a sign of the capacity of the mercy of God, for the servant after he came with disbelief and disobedience, the height of his life, then if he comes with faith in the last of his life This is the great praise, and it is narrated that the angels say to the example of this person: you come and if you have been aware of, and it is narrated that he is peace be upon him, he said: The excessive, and the exalted, and the exalted, and the meaning of the Lord was the Almighty saying: His Lord is seventy years.I swear to me in the seventy years, the more it is the period of infidels and the disobedience, the more repentance of it is more acceptable.The second face in the answer: It was narrated that what is meant by people is the people of Yemen, Abu Hurairah said: When this surah came down, the Messenger of God said: The people of the Yemeni came up with a full people whose hearts are faith and jurisprudence is safe and the rule is right.The third question: The jurisprudence of jurisprudence and many of the speakers said: The faith of the imam is correct, and they needed this verse, they said: It is the truth The most common and made it one of the greatest of the one on the authority of peace be upon him, and if their faith would not be correct, what he mentioned in this offer, then we know that they did not know The bodies With the evidence, and not to prove its place, the exalted beyond the body, the place, and the perception, nor the proof of its being, the exalted of a scholar of all the information that is not the end of the On the hands of Muhammad ﷺ, and there is no proof that the resurrection of the miracle is how it indicates honesty, and the knowledge is that these Arabs were not aware of this The imitation (P-145) is correct, and it is not said: They were scholars with the origins of these questions; Because I domesticated this indication, but they were ignorant of conquest, but it is not from the condition of the one who is a person who is a world, as it is a scholar.Because we say: Evidence does not accept the leadership and the shortage, then the evidence is if it is a compound of ten times, then whoever knows nine of them, and it is nine of it, and it is in the righteous A condemnation was in the result, not a referral; Because the height of the imitation is the first to be a conversion, even if it is aware of the entire group of those adopted subconsciousness Ziadah, if it is an adept part in the significance of this indication, the first twentieth supplies are the periphery of the evidence, for it is necessary with it from this We were satisfied with that twenty, and if the increase is considered an adept in the significance of that indicative, that was a matter of separation from that evidence, as well On that indicators, it has proven that the knowledge is a sign of evidence that does not accept the leadership and the two, but it is said: These are the Arabs, they were the scholar of the world These are what are the one that has distracted them from that one, and that is an arrogant or what they were like that, so that you have proven that they were the one who was immersed, It was narrated from Al -Hasan that he said: When the Messenger of God opened the Mecca, the Arabs were accepted by some of them, and they said: If he is bound by the family Harves them from the elephants, and everyone who wanted them worse, then they took in Islam, as parties, other than a fight, this is what the good narrated, and it is known that the one who is the one who is not Mecca, it must be on the right, not good, so we knew that they were not inferred, but rather imitated.The following question: The religion of God is the Islam for the Almighty saying: The religion of God is Islam [Al -Imran: 19] and his saying: And whoever is surprised by the religion of Islam, then he will be from the religion of Islam.The debt has other names, including faith, God Almighty said: So we are brought out by those in it among the believers.He has what is in the heavens and what is in the land [Al -Shura: 53] And from the word of God, and from the light: to be shed, the light of God [Al -Saf: 8] and the guidance is for his saying: He guides whoever will be blessed [Al -Nahl: 93] and from the rhetoric: So he did not.22] And from the rope: and they were shocked by the rope of God [Al -Imran: 103] and among them is the dye of God, and the innate of God, but he said: In the religion of God and he did not say: in the religion of the Lord, no The first: That this name is the greatest of the names of its affairs on the self and the adjectives, as if it says: This religion is if it is not a summary of it, so it is a debt that is a debt that is the religion of God Acceptance.And the second: If he said: The religion of the Lord would not feel that this religion is that you must accept it because he is your Lord, and I do not have the best to you By demanding the benefit, so the salvation will not be a habit, as if he says the most savings of servitude with a regeneration that I am a god, not for a benefit that will return to you.The fifth question: Al -Fawj: The many group was in which the tribe entered with its family when they were entering in it one and two and two of the two, and two of the two God has cried one day, and he said to him: What makes you cry?Delivery after giving.”
