The researcher is the Almighty: God, the silence in which there are questions: the first question: they are mentioned in an interpretation: (the steadfast) and Jahin: the first: that he did with the meaning of the meaning of it.Mr.Al -Mamoud to Him in Al -Hawiya, the poet said: ؎ Do not make the obedience to the best of the children I said to him ∗∗∗ Take it, then you are the master and the evidence for the health of this interpretation.What was narrated Peace is the master who is silent to him in Al -Hawaij."And the lean said: I did this matter of this matter, that is, I intended his intention.And the second saying: that the steadfast is the one who has no woven, and from it it is said: the plot of the vials is the Samad, and something is desperate, that is, the crucifixion is not in it, and it is a murmur, and he said: The indication is a predecessor of the tallers, which is the fast, and some of those who are delayed from the people of the language said: The steadfast is the dress from the stone that does not accept the dust, nor does it come from the dust and does not enter the Something, and know that a people have inferred from the ignorance of the likeness of this verse that he is a body of body The presentation of this verse indicates that it is not possible for what is meant by the steadfastness of this meaning, and because the steadfastness of this interpretation is the description of the bodies of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same as the righteousness of the bodies, So then it is necessary for that to be carried on his metaphor, and that is because the body that is like that will be the extent of the acting and the influence of others, and that Glory be to his self -affection, which is forbidden to change in his presence, his survival, and all his attributes, so this is what is related to the linguistic research in this verse.As for the interpreters, we have been transferred from them, some of which are met with the first face, which is the same as the exalted master, who is a bouncing to him in the payment of the needs, and he is the righteousness, and he is to pay the needs, and he is to pay the needs, And some of it with the second face, which is the same, is a duty, and the obligation of the existence in itself and in its attributes is forbidden to alienate in them, and it is a reference to the negative attributes, and the rituals of the ritual Collected for John.As for the first type: they mentioned in it Wooh: The first: the steadfast is the scientist with all the information because it is a lady

in an order without it.As for the second type: It is the sign of the robotic attributes, so they mentioned it in it.The second: the steadfastness that is not by one of its saying: He is the one who is on the authority of his servants [Al -Anam: 18] and he is not afraid of those who are on the authority of him, and he does not hope for those who are left.The third: Qatada said: He does not eat and does not drink: and he feeds and does not feed [Al -Anam: 14].Al -Rabaa: Qatada said: The rest after the death of his creation: everyone who has a van [Rahman: 26].Fifth: Al -Hasan Al -Basri said: He who was not still and is still, and the demise is not permissible for him, no place, no place, no time, no time, no throne, no chair, nor a garden, nor a woman, and he is now.Sixth: Abi Bin Kaab said:

said: He is the one who does not describe one attribute.The ninth: The fighter of Bin Hayyan said: He is the one in which there is no disadvantage.Al -Ashir: Al -Rabi’ah ibn Anas said: He is the one who is not accustomed to the pests.Al -Hadi Ten: Saeed bin Jabir said: He is the whole in all his attributes, and in all his actions.The second is ten: Jaafar Al -Sadiq said: He who is overwhelmed and does not overcome.The third is ten: Abu Hurairah said: He is the one who seeks me from anyone.The fourth is ten: Abu Bakr al -Warraq said: He is the one who is the periphery of his knowledge of his

that it is a resource for the changes and the changes, and from the surrounding of the Azaminah, the place, the mortality.As for the third face: it is that the memorization of the stereotype is carried on all of it and it is an innervil; Because, according to his significance, on the one who is the same, it indicates all the spectacles, and according to his significance on his as a principle for all of all.The second question: His saying: God is the silence that it is not in the presence of a stereotype except God, and if the steadfastness is an informative of the description of the one who is in the face, or in the face, or in the face, or in Al -Hawiya, or in Al -Hawaj The same is that it is not in the presence of the existence of the existence, so except God Almighty.This verse indicates that there is no god but the one, so he said: God is one of his significance to one of his own, in the sense that he is not in the same Plain and do not reflect on the face of the faces, and his saying: God, the silence, is a sign of one of his universe, in the sense of the denial of the partnership, the dads and the sins.And he remained in the verse two questions: The first question: Why did anyone come to be denied, and the Samad came knowing?The answer: The majority of the most common of creation is that all the stabbings are sensitive, and you have proven that every sense is divided, so it is not a division, and it is not a division.The most creation, and the steadfastness is the one who is described to him in the neighborhood, and this was known to the Arabs, but rather the creation of the creation of what he said: They will say to God [Al -Zukhruf: 87] and if the limit is unknown, denounced when the most creation is, and the Samadi was the knowledge of the confirmation when the creation came, not It is noticed on the path of denunciation, and the steadfastness was preserved on the way of the norm.(P-168) The second question: What is the benefit in the frequency of God in his saying: God is one of God, the Exalted?.The answer: If this note is not repeated, it is not obligatory in the word (one and a single) that he wanted either two denunciations or two knowledge, and we have been clear, so that we have, so that it is so This is a note until one of the memorials was mentioned and the stereotypes are known.
