The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: Or do you say that Abraham, Istamil, Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were humiliated or Christians, say that you know the mother of God From God and what God is unaware of what you do (P-81) I know that in the verse two questions: the first question: Ibn Amir, Hamza, Al-Kisa’i, and the sake of a On the address, as if he said: Do you need us, or do you say, and those who are responsible for that he is a brother of Jews and the Christians, so on the first, he is enticed to be, "mother of" mother.The two pilgrims are attached to our affairs, the triumphs, so we are united, or by following the religion of the prophets, so we are followed?And to be cut in the sense of: but you will say and the hamsti for the denial as well, and on the second, it will be cut off to cut it with the meaning of the meaning of the meaning.The first, as if it was said: Do you say that the prophet was before the descent of the victor and the Gospels, or Christians.The second question: Rather, God denounced that saying to them to his face: one of them: because Muhammad has proven his prophethood with the sake They lied in that, and they have proven, not the case, as they lied to them.And the second: the testimony of the mandate and the evangelization that the prophets were at the same.And the third of it: that the stream and the Gospel were removed after them.And its elevation: They called for that, without a proof, and God spoke to them, the Almighty, in the exposure of the expulsion on the path of denying and the abuse of it.They are their souls that they know that they were liars as they say.As for his words, the Exalted: Say: You know the mother of God, so it was intended that God has known and told him sincere and I have been informed of the mourning and the Gospels and in the Qur’an on the authority of the tongue.They are innocent of the Judaism and Nasraniya.If it was said: This is said to be what he knows and they know him and they called him, so how does he correct the words?We said: Whoever said: They were on the belief and delusion, so the words are back and whoever said: Know that they are united, so I mean that your house is the house of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one This is beneficial with his acknowledgment that God knows.* * * As for his saying: And whoever is darkened by those who have a testimony with him from God, he has three faces.One of them: that in the verse, it is evaluated, delayed, and appreciation: whoever is darkened by God from those who have been a testimony that has been received by him as a saying of you: whoever says: Whoever says: For the testimony and the meaning: If Abraham and his sons were a sofa or Christians, then God has fulfilled this martyr With his justice and his etc.From lies, we know that it is not like that.And the second: and who I am darkened from you, and the Christians and the Christians if you fulfill this testimony from God, and from his saying: From God, you are attached to the rituals of the saying As if he said: Whoever darkens of those who have a martyr, he did not establish it with God, but rather his dead and hidden it.And the third of it: to be: “from” in his saying: From God, the prayer of testimony and the meaning: and whoever darkens from those who have been a martyr who came from God, then he will be the same as the man of God.I have a testimony from you, that is, a testimony that I heard from you and a testimony that came to me from your face and from you.As for his saying: And what God is with the heavie of what you do is, the universal speech is for every one and a feast, and whoever conceives that he is the highest knowledgeable of his secret and his abundance is that he is not hidden from him Fakhr, and if evil is an evil that does not go on to a eyes, except for a caliber, not to see that one of us, even if he had a stereotype on the authority Caution and the man with the fact that that is the signer, only knowing the phenomenon, so how can the Lord the sophisticated, who knows the secret and is hidden if he threatens and promises from the gun.
