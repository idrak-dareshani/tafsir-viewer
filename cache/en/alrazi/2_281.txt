The Quranic researcher said: If it is a hardship, then it is a look at a facilitator, in which there are two issues: the first question: the grammarians said: “It was a word that is used to work: With a house that happened and fell, and that was in his saying: It was the matter, that is, found, and then he does not need news.The second: that the meaning of the event is removed from it, so the word will be stricken for the time, and then he needs the news, and that is as his saying: it was a good increase.And I know that when I was residing in the Khariza, and there was a group of the dignitaries, I wanted them forms in this section, so I said: You say that if you said: Be an act and this is a referral; Because the verb is what was indicated by the incident of time, then he said, “It was“ indicating the meaning of the meaning of the olive in the past time, and if he benefited this meaning, then it is complete, then it is complete, then it is complete.It requires that if it was a verb, it was complete, not incomplete, and if it is not complete, it is not a verb, but it was a letter, and you are denying that Long -time, and they classified the answer to it as books, and they did not know in it, then revealed to me the secret Your saying was found and spoke to two sections: one of them: that the meaning is: found and the thing happened as your saying: the presence of the ritual and the angry.The second: that the meaning is: found and the Mawsiyyah of the thing is a thing, so if you say: it was a well -known, then it was a matter of the past in the past time, The first section is the name that is complete, and the second section is the name of the deficiency, and in the truth, the concept of “was” in the two people is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the two times What is meant is the oppression of the thing in itself, so the one was not sufficient, and what is meant in the second division is the severity of one of the two things.The one is sufficient, but it is necessary for the remembrance of the two names (P-89) so that it can be referred to to the mystical one of them with the other A verb was indicative of the export in the past time, then it will be complete, not incomplete, and if we say: It is not a verb, but rather a letter, then it is a letter, so it is a letter, so it is a letter, so the And the future and the matter, and all the properties of the verbs?And if the matter is carried out on what we said, it is clear that it is a verb and the form of the kidney is removed.The third concept is: It is in a sense that has become, and they sought: It is forbidden for what we mentioned, because the meaning has become that it is the same as the mystical self with this characteristic, after that it was not a man, and it is true, and it is true.However, it is a juvenile Specialized, which is that it is a matter of mystics with this row after the time of the self -timer.The fourth concept: to be excessive and tightened: المرية The sons of the children of Abi Bakr, they will be forgotten ∗∗∗ on the Jiad al -Jiab.So we say: In (was) in this verse and Jahan: The first: that it is in the sense of a spot and spoke, and the meaning: and if there is a hardship, and his counterpart: 282] By raising in the sense: If a present merchant is located, and the meaning of the verse is valid, it is valid on this memory and that; Because it was said: If it is difficult, then the meaning is: if the cheerful is a hardship, then a look, then the view will be short on it, and the matter is like it, and it is not for you.Because the destroyed and otherwise, if he is difficult, he has the view of the facilitator, the second: that it is deficient in the deletion of the news, its estimation, even if it is a hardship for you, Harda) and the estimation: If the sung is hard, and he reads “and who is hard”.The second question: the hardship is a name of insolvency, and it is an excuse for the supply of money; It is said: The hardship of the man, if he becomes the case of hardship, is the case in which the money is difficult.* * * Then he said: A look at a facilitator in which there are questions: the first question: in the verse is a deletion, and the estimation: the rule or the matter is a view, or the one who treats it.The second question: a look, that is, the last, and the name is the name of the eye, which is the vigor, it says: The thing is the thing with a look and a look, he said: He said: He said: He said: They are sent, he said that you are from the eyes [Al -Arif: 14, 15] to the day of the known time.The third question: Reading “the view of“ the unity of the shadow, and a giving (his view) was read, that is, the truth is the right, that is, his expense, or the owner of his eyes, Like their saying: a living and less, that is, a grass and a heart, and from it, so he looks at it on the matter, that is, forgive it in the eyes of the evening.The following question: the facilitator is effective from the secret and the left, which is against insolvency, and it is the facilitator of the supplies of money, and from it it is said: the family of the man is the one who is a man The easy, easy, and rich.(P-90) The fifth question: a navigator (easy) reader with the cinema and the rest of its conquest, and they are two famous languages ​​such as the grave, and the honorable, and the honorable, and the honorable And the conquest is the most famous of the two lines; Because he came in their words many.The sixth question: they disagreed that the ruling of view is specialized in rabies or a year in all, so Ibn Abbas, Sharih, Al -Dahlak, Al -Saddi, and Abraham, said: Sheriff that he commanded the love of one of the two characteristics, and it was said: It is a hardship, so Sharih said: But that is in usury, and God Almighty said in his book God commands you to perform the trusts to its people [the women: 58] and the interpreters mentioned the reason for the descent And his Messenger said the fourth brother who was treated with the gods: Rather, we repent to God, for there is no energy for us to war and the Messenger of God, and they will be blessed.That is, the sons of the deceased, and they said: Taken us until the boils are realized, so they refused to delay them, so God Almighty descends: and if it is a good.The second saying: It is the saying of a vicinity and a group of the two interpreters: It is general in every debt, and they needed what we mentioned that he said: And if it is a hardship, it is not a hardship, and it is not a hardship.Let the judgment be general in all the interpreters, the judge said: The first saying is more likely; Because he is the Almighty, he said in the advanced verse, and if you are folded, you will be the heads of your money, without underestimation and no deficiency.Fate; Because the theory is intended to delay, it is imperative that his remembrance be presented until the delay is required, but when it is proven that the attention is in this way, this is the same in this And his duty in the birds of the images is the harm of the vision in the sense, which is that the one who is unable to perform the money is not permissible to cost him, and this is the saying of the most of the jurisprudence as the one who is the one May God be pleased with them.The seven question: Know that it is necessary to explain the insolvency, so we say: Epistent is that he does not find what he performs with his eyes, and he does not have what he has to do with him The debt is from the same, for this is our saying: Whoever finds a house and clothes is not intended in the affliction of hardship, if he can sell it and perform the then of it, and it is not permissible for him to be love They must have a loser for their prayers and pay the cold and the free from them.And they differed if it is strong, does it obligate to it for the same one or otherwise?And some of them said: He is obligated to that, as he is obligated if he needs himself and his life, and some of them said: He does not have to do so, and they are lost if it is also if it is What he performs, is it necessary for acceptance and performance, or does it require that, as for those who have a goodness that has been brought to him, then he must have to do it, so that he would not be able to do it And perform it in the debt.The eighth question: If a person knows that his deceit is a hardship that he has been forbidden, and he would be asked for what he has, so he is obligated to the time of the time, for the time His insolvency is permissible for him to hold him to the time of insolvency, and know that if he claims insolvency and the deceased lied to him, then this debt that is obligated to do so For him, such as the sale and the loan, or it is not Likewise, and in the first section, two witnesses must be established, and that this is the one that has been done, and in the second oath, which is that the debt is proven, or the debt is not.A honest or a guarantee, the saying was his saying and on the sunset because the origin is the poverty.* * * Then he said: And to believe the best for you, if you know and in it the issues: (P-91) The first question: Read Assembly.By tightening it, and the origin is in it: to believe in two years, then whoever relieves the deletion of one of the two times is reduced, and whoever tightens the ticking of the two times.The second question: in believing: The first: the first: it is: and that you believe in the hardship of the debt of the debt, as it is not valid for it, but it is permissible for it, but it is permissible for it, but it is permissible for it, The deletion of knowledge of it; Because he has been mentioned by the most insignificant and the male of the head of money, he knew that belief was returned to them, and it is like his saying and that you are reluctant to the piety: By believing, he said that he is the debt of a Muslim man, so he delays him, unless he has every day of charity.Because view has proven to be the first verse, then this verse must be carried on a new benefit, and because his saying: it is better for you to do not.The third question: What is meant by good is the beautiful praise in the world and the rewarding reward in the last.* * * Then he said: If you know and in it, the first: the first: it is with it if you know that this belief is better for you, if you do it, then make it to you A hard -line threat to the stick.And the second: If you know, then the charity is given to view and arrest.The third, if you know that what your Lord commands you is good for you.* * * Then the Almighty said: Fear a day in which you will return to God, then every soul will pass away.And they were the people of richness, majesty, supporters, and agents, and they might run from them to overcome people with the causes Rubber, and from taking the money of people in falsehood, then God promises them to be in this verse, and he fear them for the greatest of the face The last verse is a verse that came down to the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and that is because he is peace be upon him, when he performed the pilgrimage to you, and you are the goodness of the I stand with the knowledge of the day, I have completed your debt, and I have come to you with my blessings [Al -Maradah: 3], then he went down and feared a day that you will return to God, and God is: Peace: O Muhammad He put it on the heads of the eighties of a verse and a verse of the cow, and the Messenger of God lived after it one and two and two days, and it was said: one and two times, and it was said: hours.The second question: Abu Amr read, “Refer to the opening of the vita and the rest of the tattoo, and I know that the return is necessary, and the return is prepared, and the one is the one.The third question: He erected a day on the verb with it, not on the parting; Because it is not the meaning: and fear this day, but the meaning is giving to the meeting with what you offer from the good deed, and the example of it is: One day, the baby makes graying [Al -Muzammal: 17] meaning: How do you fear this day, which this will be with the infidels with God.The following question: The judge said: The day is a reflection of a special time, and that is not fulfilled.The world with the commitment of the sinners, and its saying became: and fear the day, the matter is included in all the clients.(P-92) Fifth question: Return to God, the Almighty is not what is related to what is related to the place and the destination, for that is referred to God Almighty, and for the good of the person who is not the reason And he kept it, for it is with them, but they were all in the Qur’an from his saying: you will return to God to God with the meaning of him: the first: that the human being has the same.The first: They are in the curtains of their mothers, then they do not have their benefit or their harm, but the one who is shrouded in them is nothing but God, and they are glorified and exalted.And the second state: they are after the pudding of the curtains of their mothers, and there is the one who is sponsored by the righteousness of their conditions at the beginning Some of them are in the ruling of the phenomenon.And the third state: after death and there is not the one who is shrouded in them in the truth except God, the Glory be to Him Before entering the world, this is the meaning of return to God.The second: that the intention will be to return to the reward or punishment that God has prepared for them, and both of the two are the good and the priest of the memorial.* * * Then he said: Then every soul passed away, and they are not wronged and they have two issues: the first question: What is meant is that every cost is for him, and it is for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the back.The reward of his work is to do, as he said: Whoever does the weight of an atom is better, he sees and who does the weight of an atom of evil that he sees [Zallal: 7, 8], and he said: He is a deceased, so it would be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the land that God will come with and he said: And the budgets are placed the installments to the Day of Resurrection, so do not be wronged, and if there is nothing He is a deceased who brought us to us and sufficient for us.The rented is that penalty; Because what the man gets his stones from money is that he describes the language that he is his infection, so he said: He died every soul that has been given to any Its acquisition, and this is the first.Because what could be the interpretation of the words, where he does not need to add to the guests.The second question: Al -Waadiya, who holds this verse on the cutting of the part of the fool, and our companions hold it in the cut in the cut.Because when he believes, then the reward for faith will reach him, and that only can be brought out of the fire and enters paradise.* * * Then he said: They do not oppress and have a question, which is that his saying: every soul passes away from what has earned, there is no meaning, except that they are not wronged, and that was a good.And his answer: It is exalted when he said: Every soul was fulfilled by what it has earned, that was an indication of the delivery of torment to the immorality and the infidels, so it was a saying that he said: The generosity is to torture his servant, and he answered him with his saying and they are not wronged and the meaning is that the servant is the one who signed himself in that point; Because God Almighty has enabled him and removed his excuse, and he facilitated the way of the recipient, and his mother, so whoever insisted, he who has offended his soul.This answer is based on the origins of the dismissed, and as for the origins of our companions, it is that it is the money of the creation of creation, and the king, if it is spent in the king of it Unjustly, and his saying was: and they did not oppress after the reminder of the return, referring to what we mentioned.
