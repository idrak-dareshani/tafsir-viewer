The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: What is the same And know that he is upset when he explained the state of Jews and the infidels in the enmity and stubbornness, the believers warned of them, so he said: What is the affection of those who disbelieved, then he exiled from the hearts He appears with him the grace of the believers, and there are two issues: the first question: Because those who disbelieves are an angel, under which Natan: the people of the book and the partners, and the evidence is upon him the saying of the Almighty: He was not among those who disbelieved from the family of 1] And the second: an increase in the use of goodness, and the third: to see the end.The second question: the good is the good, and that is mercy, indicating his words to the Almighty: the most important people are divided by the mercy of your Lord [Al -Zukhruf: 32] that the meaning is that they are To them, and they will envy you and what they love to bring down something from you.Then they showed that this envy does not affect the disappearance of that.His saying is the Almighty what we are copy Islam, and they said: Do you not see to Muhammad, whose companions are commanded (P-205) with an order, then he forbids them from him and commands them with his disagreement, and he says the day, and he said: This is the verse, and the words in the verse are arranged on the issues: the first question: the copying is in the origin of the language in the sense of the hero of the thing, and the locking is: It is for the sake It is said: The wind has copied the effects of the people if they are numbered, and the sun is copied if it is numbered, because it may not get the shadow in another place until it is that he is not.Unless the Satan wished for his wish, then God will copy what the Satan is delivered [Hajj: 52], meaning: He removes and invalidates it, and the origin in the true words.And if the uniformity is proven in the abuse, it must not be a right in the transfer of a motivation for your destruction.If it was said: The wind described them as a people for the monuments, and the sun is that it is a dirt for the shadow is a metaphor, because the removal of the effects and the shadow is God, and if it is the Almighty, and if it is the Almighty It is on the basis of the memorial in its significance, and then we are opposed to what you mentioned and say: Rather, the copy is the transmission and the conversion, and it is the book of the book, and it is the book of the book, He transmits him or transmits his story, and from it, the transcription of the souls, the transcription of the centuries after a century, and the transcription of the inheritances, but it is the one who turns from one of the first Hope: This is our book We were copying what you were doing [Al -Jathiya: 29], so the memorization should be a right in the transfer, and it is necessary that it is not a truth in the rituals of the heart, The first of two faces: one of them: that it is not forbidden that God be the transcriber of that from where it is the verb of sun and the influencing wind in the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one To make them a specialist with that effect.والثّانِي: أنَّ أهْلَ اللُّغَةِ إنَّما أخْطَئُوا في إضافَةِ النَّسْخِ إلى الشَّمْسِ والرِّيحِ, فَهَبْ أنَّهُ كَذَلِكَ, لَكِنَّ مُتَمَسَّكَنا إطْلاقُهم لَفْظَ النَّسْخِ عَلى الإزالَةِ, لِإسْنادِهِمْ هَذا The verb to the wind and the sun.And on the second: that the transfer is more special than abuse; Because it was where the transfer was found, it was a row and its obstacle obtained another adjective, because the divorce of the number is more important than the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Between the private and the public, he made him a right in the first year, and God knows.The second question: Ibn Amir read: (We do not copy) by the light of the noun and the breaking of the cinema, and those with their openness, but the reader of Ibn Amir, in it, is the one who is in it: And copy it with one means.The second: I was copying it.As a people said to the pilgrims, and a man has crucified: they were grave, and so, that is, make him a grave.(We forget it) by opening the noun and the hamza, and it is a reward for the condition, and the father of Amr does not call the hamsti in the same way as this; Because it will be a mark for the reward, which is one of the women, and it is the last.And from it: the human being is a increase in the infidels [repentance: 37] and from it called the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake, and the people of the language said: God has misdeed out, and he has worsened, and he said: And peace: “Whoever is pleased with the wages in the sake of the sake, and the leadership in the sustenance; Let him reach his mercy.The rest of the noun and the breaking of the Sunnah, and it is one of the forgetfulness, and then the most people who carried it on the forgetfulness, which is against the remembrance, and among them is those who carried the forgetfulness on the one who said: We forgot and did not find it with him with determination [Taha: 115], meaning: he left, and he said: So on the day we forget them as they forgot to meet their day this [Al -A'raf: 51], meaning: The forgotten on the blessing is metaphor; Because the forgotten is left, when the leaving was from the boundaries of the forgetfulness, they released the name of the obligatory, and read it, "we forget it," and "we forget it", and “we forget it”, And “forget it”, and “forget it” on the discourse of the Messenger, and read the servant of God: “What we forget about a verse or we copy it,” and he read Hudhafah: “We do not copy it.” (P-206) The third question: “What” in this verse is rewarding, as your saying: What is made is made, and the work of the penalty in the condition and the penalty if they are Muda’din: (We are copy Permanent.The following question: Know that the transcription in the terminology of the scholars is a phrase of a legal way that indicates that the judgment that was stable with a stereotype is not a jurisprudence that does not He was bruised by him on the face of his hope.Our saying: a legal way - we mean the destiny that is blessed between the saying that is from God Almighty and for his Messenger, and the de facto of them.The nation’s gathering is removed from it on one of the two sayings, because that is not a legal way to this interpretation, and it is not necessary for the sake to be the one who is the one who is the one The mind is not a legal way, and it is not necessary for the miracle to be a copyist for the lawful judgment; Because the miracle is not a jurisprudence, and the referee is not necessary with an absence, condition, or sophistication; Because that is not cruel, and it is not necessary if God commands us with one verb, and then we forbade the same; Because if this is not like this, it was not the same as the judgment of the matter.* * * The fifth question: the copying is a mind that is a mind and a hearing is a disagreement for the Jews, because some of them have denied it with a mind, and among them is a reason Hearing, narrated from some Muslims the denial of copying, and the crowd was transmitted by Muslims on the permissibility of copies and its fall; Because the evidence indicated the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ and his prophecy is only valid with the saying of the transcription The Jews are two synonyms: The first: It came in Al -Tawarah that God Almighty said to the peace be upon him, when there is an arrogance from the aroma: That is for you, as the grains of the grass, so that the blood did not eat, so do not eat it.The second: Adam, peace be upon him, married the sister from the brother, and he forbade him after that on Moses, peace be upon him.Menkaro Al -Nakhn said: We do not deliver that the prophecy of Muhammad - upon him be prayers and peace - is only valid with the saying of the transcription; Because it is permissible to say: Moses and Jesus - peace be upon them - the people of them were commanded to the time of the time of the appearance of the tribe of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, then the peace of God Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - when the appearance of Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - was removed from the law, and they are removed by their law, and the ritual of the prayer is made by the ritual.And peace, but it is not a copy, but a running running saying: Then they complete the fast to the night [Al -Baqarah: 187], and the Muslims who denounced the origin of the origin They were gone on this letters, and they said: You have been established in the Qur’an that Moses and Jesus - peace be upon them - have been preached in Al -Tawarah and Al -Najil in the authority of Muhammad Prayer and peace, and that when his appearance is obligatory to his law, and if the matter is like that, then the resurrection of this involvement is the prevail of the reward, and this is the ritual of the ritual The two synagogues, the two of the two, and the transcription of the copy, that they said: God is exalted, when the law of Jesus, peace be upon him, said: It is also on her or not, or what has been in it always and not on the feet, for if it is clear in it, it is proven in it, then it turns out that it was as long as it was as long Unable to the law, and also, and if we had our goodness, we did not have a way to know that our law does not become a bond; Because the maximum in the door is that the law says: This is a constant project and does not make a tissue of the core of the milk, but if we see the same as this words, it is a matter Peace be upon them that they did not sleep, the trustee was removed from it in all pictures.If it was said: Why is it not permissible to say: the memory is mentioned in the permanent, and then he has been counted by what indicates that he will be copied or what he has been in it except that he is not.To us in the sentence?We said: This is a weakness for its faces: (P-207) is one of them: that the prescription is made for the permanent memorials with the prescription that it does not last as a whole between the two words Sufficiency and messing around.And secondly: On this estimation, God has come to be exalted, that their law will become woven, so if his journey is transferred, he must be transferred, this is the whole way, because it is the same, because it is the same, because it is the same, so that it is the same.The basic of the law is the same as this entity to reward it as well, and then we have no way to the piece by the fact that we are the one who is not the same; Because that is one of the great beings in which the reasons are available in its transfer, and what was like that was to be dedicated and his justification to the limit of the frequency, or the Qur’an His opponents are transferred, and perhaps Muhammad ﷺ changed this legs from this position and is not transferred, and if you fix it, it is necessary to transfer this as how So we say: If God is the Almighty, a text in the time of Moses and Jesus - peace be upon them - that their legislators will be guided by two forgetfulness, so that is a famous for the family With the harm, and if it was like that, it would be impossible to dispute the great gathering in it, so where our opinion is the Jews and the Christians, they are kept on the denial of that, the knowledge of our knowledge is that we have not known to us.Their legislators are two woven.As for the second division: It is said: God Almighty is a text on the law of Moses, peace be upon him, and he was coupled with what is indicated by him that he is a constant.This is false, when it was proven that if it was like that, it would have been known to be known to the people The frequency, and also, the appreciation of its health is not a copy, but rather it is a gift to the language.As for the third section: It is that it is a text on the law of peace be upon him, and he did not show it in it as permanently, or as it is permanent, so it is permanent, so it is permanent, so it is not permanent.The jurisprudence is that the excess of the matter does not benefit the repetition, but rather it is beneficial to the same time, so if the cost comes with the same time, then it has come out of the task of the matter, and the matter That is not a copy of the first command, so you have proven this division that the saying of the transcription is referred.And he knew that after that we decided this sentence in the book of the crop in the origins of jurisprudence, our holding in the transcription of the copy is with the saying of the Almighty: Other than it, or the same, and the reciprocate of it is also weak; Because “what” is the condition of the condition and the penalty, and as you say: And whoever comes to you, I will honor it - it does not indicate the arrival of the coming, but rather that it came when it came, then it is the right of the It indicates the acquisition of the copy, but rather that the copy is obtained, it must come with what is better than it, so it is stronger that we are dependent on the evidence of the saying A verse [Al -Nahl: 101] and his saying: They praise God what he creates and proves, and he has the mother of the book [Al -Raad: 39], and God Almighty knows.* * * The sixth question: they agreed on the fall of the copies in the Qur’an with its faces: one of them: this is the verse and it is the saying of the Almighty: we are not copy Likewise, the father of a Muslim answered him with his faces: The first: that what is meant by the texts of the human beings is the bouquet that is in the valuable books of the consequences and the rituals, the same And the Maghreb, what God has placed upon us and worshiped us otherwise, for the Jews and the Christians were saying: “Do not believe except for those who follow your religion.” With this verse.The second face: What is meant from the copy is the transfer of it from the fragmented wave and its conversion to it to the book of the books, and it is as it is said the book.The third direction: I have shown that this verse does not indicate the fabrics of copies, but rather that if the copy was fell, it would fall to the best of it, and from the one who answered the one who answered from it That the verses, if they are released, then the meter (P-208) has the verses of the Qur’an; Because he is the bodies with us.And on the authority of the second: that the transmission of the Qur’an is from the fragmented wave, it is not summarized by some of the Qur’an, and this copy is summarized by each other, and the one who says: The verse is noticed by the Qur’an, but rather it is general in all the evidence, and on the second: We do not surrender that the copy is removed in the verse, and the Qur’an is in particular.Know: What we are copying from the broken wave, then we come after it with what is better than it.The second Hajj For those who say that the copying of the copies in the Qur’an: that God is up to the deceased who died from it, its husband is completely in addition to it And they warn of marriages to their faces, belonging to the minds [Al -Baqarah: 240] Then we copy this with four months and ten as he said: And those who are died from you They are raised with themselves four months and twenty [Al -Baqarah: 234] Abu Muslim said: The one who is reluctant to take place is still in the college; Because if she was a pregnant woman and the duration of her pregnancy is completely around, she would have fully prepared it, and if this judgment remains in some of the pictures, then it was not for you The number of lambs will pass by putting the lamb, whether the lamb put the lamb with a year, less or more, so make the enemy the enemy be a good.The third pilgrimage: God commanded the custody of the charity between the hands of Najwa, the Messenger, by saying: O you who believe, if you survive the Messenger, then grant you the Messenger Checking [Al -Mujadala: 12] Then he copied that, the father of Muslim said: It is still because of the weight of his causes; Because the reason for worshiping it is that the hypocrites are distinguished from where they do not believe the believers, so when this syntax obtained the worship.The answer: If it was like that, it would not be who did not believe an agreement, and it is false; Because it was narrated that he did not believe that it is not upon me - may God be pleased with him - and his saying is revealed to him: So when you did not do and repent to God: 13] The fourth pilgrimage: that he is a command of the one who is the same for the twenty, with the saying of the Almighty: if one of you is one of you, who are patient, they will be overwhelmed by two water: [65] [65] With the words of the Almighty: Now God relieves you and knows that there is weakness, for if you are a good hundred of you, they will be overwhelmed by two hundred [Al -Anfal: 66].The fifth pilgrimage: His Exalted, the Exalted, will say that the fools will say from the people, and what they have before their kiss The dominance of the mosque is the forbidden [Al -Baqarah: 144].Abu Muslim said: The ruling of that kiss is still in the kidneys, for the jurisdiction of the journey to it at the time, or with knowledge if there is an excuse.The answer: that on what you mentioned, there is no difference between the sanctuary of the sanctuary and the path of the flaws, for the property in which the house of the sanctuary is distinguished Copy.The sixth pilgrimage: His exalted say: And if we change a verse that is a verse, and God knows what is revealed.And the manifestation is either recitation, or the judgment, how was it a ram of and copying, but we are weakened in this indicative; Because each one of them indicates the fall of copies in the sentence, and the father of a Muslim took the fact that God is exalted and described His book is that the falsehood does not come from him from his hands or from his successor, so if we were copied, then the falsehood would have come to him.The answer is that what is meant is that this book did not give it from the books of God what he invalidates, and does not come after him, as well as what he invalidates.* * * The seven question: the woven is either that the judgment is the only one or the recitation of the only one or they are together, but the one who is the woven is the ruling without the righteousness without the righteousness We set it up, and the one who is the height is the recitation only, so (P-209) narrated from Omar that he said: We were reading the verse of the custodian: “The sheikh and the sheikh The bit is a meant of God, and God is a wise, and narrated: “If the son of Adam had money and a debt of money, he would not have a third of them, and he would not be filled On the one who repented, ““ As for the one who is the human being, the ruling and recitation with it is what Aisha narrated - may God be pleased with her - that the Qur’an has descended in breastfeeding, We are copied with five information, for the twenty -year -old recitation and judgment, and the fifth is the permeation of recitation, the rest of the judgment.It is also narrated that the surah of the parties was in the seven -long home or increased, then the decrease was located in it.* * * The eighth question: The interpreters are different in the words of the Almighty: what we are copy The book was copied, and it is the saying of a gift and Saeed ibn al -Masib, and whoever says the first saying, they mentioned it in it.The Qur’an is what was read among you, then you forgot, and it is the saying of good and deaf, and the most speaking, so they carried it on the copy of the ruling without the recitation of the ruling, And recitation together, if it was said: this forgetfulness is a variety of mind and legitimate.As for the mind, because the Qur’an must be from its delivery to the people of frequency, and the forgetfulness is on the people of frequency in all of them.As for the transmission, the transgression of the Almighty is: We are the remembrance of the remembrance, and we have the preservatives [Al -Hijr: 9] and the answer to the first is from the one who is: the first: that the first: With his widening from the Qur’an, and his delay from the total of what is completed and brought to him in prayer or is invoked by it, then if the judgment of worship is removed from it, and the covenant is over, or the covenant is the one who is the one who is the most important He remembers the news of the one, and he becomes for this face as a forgotten from the breasts.The second answer: That will be a miracle of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and it is narrated in it.The answer is about the second: that it is opposed to the Almighty saying: We will read you, so do not forget except what God wills [Al -Ala: 6] and by saying: And remember your Lord if you forget [24].The second saying: “We are not copying from A verse “That is: we change it, either by replacing its judgment, only, or its recitation, then, or we will replace them, but the saying of the Almighty: or we forgot it, then we will not be forgotten.We replace it, and we have indicated that the forgetfulness in the sense of the blessing has come, so the verse becomes a verse that the one who replaces it, then we come with a good or like it.We are copying from a verse, that is: what we raise after its removal or we forget it on the readings of the ham So we do not copy it immediately, for we are descending with what it is based on the reconciliation.We forget it, that is, we leave it, and it is the verse that has become woven in the judgment, but it is not forgotten in recitation, but it is the rest of the recitation, so whoever says: A verse, that is, we are copying it from the urine, or we will be delayed.His saying: From a verse, all the interpreters have carried it on the verse from the Qur’an, other than my father, a Muslim.(P-210) Its reconciliation, there is no more than the one who was hidden from the first.With the first time, the second is, and the second is the question, so the question is still.We copy the judgment except to a substitute, and begged that this verse indicates that it is upset if it is copy And the heart of the substitute.The copying is not to a replacement that it is a copy of the charity between the hands of the Messenger ﷺ not to the second.And they were taken by saying that it is good for it, or the same.Goodly, what is more rewarded in the hereafter, then the one who indicates his struggles that God is glorified in the right Ashura with Ramadan, The prayer was two rak'ahs at a people, so we were fell in four in the presence.If you know this, then we say: As for the transcription of the thing to the heavily, it has fallen into the mentioned pictures.And twenty, and the weapon of the night prayer is to be seduced in it.As for the copying of the thing to the like, it is the conversion from the house of the sanctuary to the kaaba.The third question: Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - said: The book is not copied with the fresh Sunnah, and he was inferred from it with this verse: He copies him from the verses, he comes with goodness from them, and that is beneficial that he comes with what is from his gender, as if the human being said: What I take from you is a garment that comes to you from it His genesis is better than him, and if it is proven that it is necessary and it is from his hatred, the horse of the Qur’an is a Qur’an.And the second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: He brought good things to it that benefits that the Qur’an is the words of God without the Sunnah that the Messenger is upon him.And the third of it: that his saying: He brings a good thing to it, it is beneficial that those who come to him are better than the verse, and the Sunnah is not better than the Qur’an.And he pushed it: He said: Did you not know that God is able to do everything that is destined to come to that good that is good, he is the one who is able to be able to do all the good.And the answer to the fourth faces with her family: that his saying is upset: we come with goodness from it, in which there is no goodness that is good for it to be people, but there is no one who does not Againing for transcription after obtaining the copy, and which indicates the investigation of this involvement that this verse is clear in that the one who comes to the goodness of that is good for you The first verse, and if the copy of that verse was arranged on the two things that good, the role was necessary while he was invalid, then the crowd was taken over the book of the book.لِأنَّ آيَةَ الوَصِيَّةِ لِلْأقْرَبِينَ مَنسُوخَةٌ, بِقَوْلِهِ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلاةُ والسَّلامُ: ”"ألا لا وصِيَّةَ لِوارِثٍ" “ وبِأنَّ آيَةَ الجَلْدِ صارَتْ مَنسُوخَةً بِخَبَرِ الرَّجْمِ.Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - said: As for the first weakened; Because the inheritance of the inheritance is a truce for the heirs that prevents from his shroud to the commandment, it has proven that the verse of the inheritance is forbidden from the commandment, and the second is also weak; Because Omar - may God be pleased with him - narrated that his saying “Sheikh and the sheikh, if they adultery, fled them, when he was a girl” was a Qur’an, so perhaps the copy, but it is the same, Male is mentioned in the origins of jurisprudence, and God knows.(P-211) As for his words, the Almighty: Did you not know that God is on everything capable, then you will be alerted to the Prophet ﷺ and otherwise on his destiny, the Almighty, on the authority His will, wisdom, and wisdom, and that he is not a motivation for what he wanted, nor what is forbidden for what he was chosen.The ninth question: the disgraceful of this verse was inferred that the Qur’an is created from its face Two values, but that is referred to; Because the copyist must be delayed from the human being, and the delayed from the thing, it is impossible to be an older, and the absurdity is that it is obligatory.Its decay was firmly imprisoned.And the second: that the verse indicated that some Qur’an is better than one, and it was not like that.And the third of it: that his saying: Did you not know that God is able to be able to indicate that what is meant is that he is the one who is able to copy it, and the one who came to the first, Inside the ability and it was a verb, the companions answered about him: that he was a people who are transcribers and bonds, but it is one of the symptoms of the righteousness, expressions, and languages, and there is no dispute, and no.The realistic meaning that is the meaning of the phrases and the updates is updated?The disgrace said: That is the meaning of the terms and languages, there is no doubt that its first attachment has been removed and has spoken to him, another, so the first comment; Because it is still, the old does not disappear, and the second attachment is an acute; Because he did not come after it was not, and the true words are not reluctant to this comment, and what does not break from this comment (the event) and what is not narrated from the one who does not And the words that you are attached to it is necessary to be an updated.The companions answered: that the power of God was in the eternal attached to the creation of the scientist, so when the world entered in the existence, is that the rest of that comment or did it not?If it remains necessary for the Qadir to be able to find the suppliers, and it is referred, and if it does not remain, then the comment is removed; So the rest of God is obligatory for you on the face that you mentioned, and the knowledge of God was related to the fact that the world will be found, then the world is in the world.The first attachment was ignorant, and if it does not remain, then you are obligated to be the first attachment to a hearing; Because if it was an older, it would be still, and the comment will be after that, then, then the world of God is up to the Almighty, and it is not reluctant to the one who does not depend on The modernist is a modern, the world of God is an event, so everything you make is an answer to world and Qadriyah, so it is our answer to the words.The question is the tenth: begging for the Almighty saying: that God is able to do anything that is powerful that the one who is the one who has been presented is the face of his ritual In the sense of the subject, which is the construction of the vagina.
