The researcher of the Qur’an, the Almighty who came to whom the writers are known to know it as they know their children, and that a group of them will assemble the truth while they know the truth, so do not know That in the verse is: the first question: its saying: those who came to the book, even if it was general according to the memorial, but it is a special one with the knowledge of them, and the knowledge of them is from them.By knowing it as they know their children, and the great collection who taught something that is impossible for them to agree on his killing in the habit, not to see that you are not.On the authority of the college, it is not permissible for anyone to throw it except with lies and killing, but it is permissible for that to be a little collection, and God knows.The second question: Al -Sadir in his saying: They know him to what he returns?They mentioned in it Wooh: One of them: He is a pioneer to the Messenger of God ﷺ, that is, they know him with great knowledge, they distinguish between him and between him, as well They and their children other than them.On the authority of Umar - may God be pleased with him - that he asked Abdullah bin Salam on the authority of the Messenger of God ﷺ He said: I know about me from me with my son, he said: And why?He said: Because I do not doubt in Muhammad that he is a prophet, but my son may be betrayed.The age of his head kissed, and it is permissible (P-117), the guarantee, even if he did not precede him.Because the words indicate that it is not affected by the poem, and the same is the same as being in it as a fool and a sense that it is the most knowledgeable, and this is the same.The first question: that it is not related to this words as before the kiss.The answer: It is the Almighty in the advanced verse, when he warned the nation of Muhammad ﷺ about following the Jews and the Christians by saying: And if you follow the whims of you from what you have come from Those who have informed the believers in his condition - peace and blessings be upon him - in this verse.And his sincerity, his call, and his kiss, they do not doubt it as they do not doubt their children.The second question: This verse is the counterpart, which is the Almighty saying: They find it written in them in the mortar and the Gospels [Al -A'raf: 157] and he said: And he will be a good [Grade: 6] Except that we say: It is an impermissible to know him as they know their children, and that is because he described it in the supply and the Gospel That is, but it will be the appointment of time, place, adjective, creativity, proportions, and tribe, or this description of what came with this type of detail, then if it is the first With its presentation in the time appointed from the country inspired by the inspired kissing on the appointed characteristic of the family of the honorable and the Moroccan; Because it was a dew and the Gospels were among the people among the people of the deceased and the Maghrib, and if the matter was like that, one of the Christians was able to do so.As for the second division: it does not benefit the piece with the sincerity of the prophethood of Muhammad - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - because we say: He endowed that the mourning is a man who is a man who is a man.A prophet, except that that description is when it was not ended in detailing to the limit of the lean, and it was not necessary from the confession with it, the confessions of Nabbu Muhammad.The answer to this forms is directed, even if our saying: that science is with his prophecy, but he obtained from the detections of the supply and the Gospels on its description, and it is not.The prophecy claimed and the miracle appeared on his hand, and everyone who was like that was a sincere prophet, for this is a proof and the proof is the one who is alleged, so there was no Muhammad ﷺ stronger and appeared than the knowledge of the children of the children and the parents of the fathers.The third question: On this direction, which you decided, the knowledge of the praise of Muhammad ﷺ is a betting knowledge, and it is not necessary for this to be the same Flag, draining me, but thinking and resusciting the confusion, so what is the likeness of the two people with thinking?The answer: It is not intended that the knowledge of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is similar to the knowledge of the children of the sons, but it is intended for it, the knowledge of the father, the father of the father, is the father of the father He knows the person of his son is a knowledge that he does not suspect, for him, otherwise, so we are here, and when this is evaluated.Because this science is a harmful and that is a view, and the theory is likened to the harmful, it benefits the exaggeration and the well -being.The loud question: Why did the male to the male?The answer: Because the male is known and the most famous, and they are with the companions of the fathers, and their hearts are affixed.The second saying: The guerrilla is in his saying: they know it as a return to the kiss: that is, the scholars of the people of the book, know the matter (P-118), the kiss, the one who is the one who has said that it is the same Their children, which is the saying of Ibn Abbas, Qatada, Al -Raba’i, and Ibn Zaid.And know that the first saying is the first of the faces: one of them: that the destiny is referring to a prior to being of a priority, and the male of knowledge is close to the saying of what is from the saying That science: the prophecy, as if it is the Almighty, he said: They know that science as they know their children, and as for the kissing, what is presented.And the second: that God is the highest of what was informed in the Qur’an that the kissing of the kiss is mentioned in Al -Tuwarah and Al -Najil, and it is informed in it that the prophecy of Muhammad is mentioned And the evangelist, so the knowledge of this known to the matter of prophecy is first.And the third of it: that the miracles do not indicate the first of its significance except for the truth of Muhammad - peace be upon him The matter of the kiss is that it is proven because it is one of what Muhammad came to him ﷺ, so this defined is the first of the prophecy.As for his words, the Exalted: If a group of them, they will assume the truth while they know, so know that those who gave the book and recognized the Messenger, for those who believe in it And follow it, and for those who remained on his disbelief, and whoever believes does not describe the right of the truth, but it is described by those who remained on his disbelief, and he said: The truth while they know and describe some of that, and indicate his saying: Let them have the right to the path of defamation, on the authority of the right in the religion, if it is a mother of the religion.And they differed in the Maktum, and it was said: the matter of Muhammad ﷺ, and it was said: the command of the kiss, and we were excluded [the search] in this question.* * * As for his saying: the truth is from your Lord, in his two questions: the first question: it is possible to be (the truth), the beginning of a deleted, that is, the truth, and the right of it: It will be a news without a news, and that it will be immediately, and it is permissible for it to be the beginning of his news: from your Lord and read to me - may God be pleased with him - from the right of the Lord) They assure the right from your Lord.The second question: the thousand and the blame in its saying: the truth is in it.His saying: Let the truth conceal, that is: this one who assigns it is the truth from your Lord, and that the Sans will be in the sense: (The truth is from God, not from the other).God Almighty is like that you are upon him, and it has not been proven that he is from God as the people of the book, so he is false.* * * As for his saying: Do not be among those who are emerging, in his two questions: The first question: Do not be among those who pass through what?They differed in it on sayings: One of them: Do not be among those who pass through that those who submit their remembrance know the correctness of your prophecy, and that they said.And the second: Rather, he will return to the kiss.And the third: to the health of its prophethood and its legacy, and this is the closeness; Because the male to him is his saying: The truth is from your Lord, so if his appearance requires the prophethood and what is included in it from the Qur’an, the sacrifice, no, no, and the custodian You are among those who are passed.The second question: that it is up to him, and if it is forbidden from the perseverance, then this indicates that he was a complaint in it, and the saying was presented in the Bayan of this.* * * (P-119)) And for each side is its money, so keep the good for the good, and when they will come to you, God will all come to you.Follow it, so keep the goods, and when they are coming God is all of you, God is over everything.People or nation; Because it is known for the meaning of them, so the additive to it was not harmful, and it is many in their words as his saying: for all of you made us a legacy of you.[48] The second question: they mentioned four faces.One of them: that all the groups are intended, meaning the Muslims, the Jews, the Christians, and the participants, and it is the saying of the deaf, he said: Because in the traders, whoever was the one who was the one who was slave is That is to God Almighty, as God has told them to say about them in his saying: These are our lips with God [Yunus: 18].And the second: It is the saying of the most scholars of the two followers, that what is meant is the people of the book: Muslims, Jews, and Christians, and those who are involved in it.And the third of it: some of them said: What is meant by all people of Muslims is a side of any side of the kaaba, who prayed to it: southern or northern, or a northern, or anchor And beg on this saying with two.The first: His Excellency said: He is her mullahs, meaning: God is his mullah, and God will not be obtained except in the Kaaba; Because what was bent by the Cultivation of Satan.The second: that God Almighty punished him by saying: Filter the good and the backs that what is meant from these goods is not for every one of the sides, and the muds of the good Kaaba.And the one who has been: others said: “And for every face”, that is, for each one of the messengers and the companions of the bouquets, the kiss of the approaches: Al -Karsi, and the kiss of the Carpeine: the Bait Al -Ma’amour, and the kiss of the Prophet who were before you: the house of the sanctuary, and the kiss of you.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty is: a face in it, two issues: the first question: read: “and for every face” on the addition, and the meaning: and every face is the one who is the same To offer the verb, as your saying: for the increase of you, you were stripped, and the more of his father are warning.The second question: Al -Farah said: A nation that made us a forgotten [Hajj: 67], for everyone who made us a legacy and a curriculum [Al -Ma’idah: 48] and it is intended that the partner has a suit, so the crime of disagreement is not disagreed Persons, and as they were assigned to the disagreement of the people, he did not exceed it, as well as its disagreement, according to the disagreement of time with the lineage to one person, for this is the right of the saying.Al -Baqoun said: What is meant is the matter of kissing; Because his saying was presented, the Almighty: He gave your face to be the domain of the mosque, so this direction must be the prohibition of that.* * * As for his saying: He is his money in his mouth and he are bids.The first: It is a hand to all, that is, and for every one who is the one who is my one (P-120) to it.The second: He is a domestication to the name of God Almighty, that is, God Almighty will give him to him, and the appreciation of the words on the first face is to say: that each of you has any of you Follow it, that is, it is accepted.And he turned to his prayers that are close to him to his Lord, and every person who rejoices in what is on him and does not separate him, so there is no way to your meeting with you The different: Follow the treachery, that is, the adulterers of the Muslims before you before you, for you are on the best of that in the world and the hereafter, but in the world, let you know.As for the hereafter, the great reward that you take is on your leadership of its affairs, for God is your reference, and when you are from the faces of the earth, the earth is in the land of God The resurrection is separated from the right and the invalid, so that the one who is obedient to you and the disobedience is clear from you, and from the misfortune from you and from the mistake, it is the one who said that it is, He said: What is meant is that each of the people of the boredom has a choice, either by project, or with a fun, so that you are taken with the verb of others, but they are for you, but they are for you, but they are for you, but they are for you, but they have their own.The words are on the second face.The first: that God introduced us that every one of these two kisses who are in the sanctuary and the heels are the one who will give it to God Almighty, if he will worship Him He knows him as a righteousness, for the two directions are from God Almighty, and he is the one who gave the faces of his servants to them.I have been satisfied with these people who say: What they have before their kisses, for God is all of you, and these are all the righteousness in the ritual of the ritual.The second: If we are pleased with his saying: and for each side of the kaaba and its aspects, the meaning was: and for all people of you the pans of Muslims, whoever is the one who is one of the people, whoever is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, So they kept the goodness to go to it from all the aspects, so if it is disappeared after leading to the kaaba, it is a single face, and it is not hidden from God, so they will be hidden from God.And they give them their business.As for the saying of the Almighty: He is her money, meaning: He is his money and his face, so he sought refrain from mentioning the face.She has assumed and satisfied her and followed her, and in the readers of Abdullah bin Amir Al -Nakhi: (He is her money) and she is the reader of Ibn Abbas, Abu Jaafar, and Muhammad Ibn Al -Bani The rest: (its money) and the rule of the son of Amir, meaning.One of them: that And his mother has lost you and you; Because it is the meaning of it, and that is, it made it in terms of its followers, and if this becomes this, in which it follows that, then that is also followed by this, so then every one of them has come to me, and it is like it, and it is like it Among his Lord is the word [Al -Baqarah: 37] and does not obtain the covenant of the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 124] and the shadows, and this is the saying of the female.The second: It is its money, that is: it was decorated with that side and loved to it, that is, it became in terms of love and satisfying it.* * * As for his saying: They kept the good, so the matter was built by the house to obedience in its time, and know that the performance of the prayer is at the beginning Hanifah, and the Shafi’i broke up with Jajah: the first: that the prayer is better for his saying ﷺ: To say it to the Almighty: Follow the good and the apparent matter for the obligatory, so if it is not achieved, then no less than the scar.And the second: Its saying: Prepared to a forgiveness from your Lord [Al -Hadid: 21] and it means what is required of forgiveness, and prayer is what is required of forgiveness, so it is obligatory to be A delegate.(P-121) And the third: It is said by the Almighty: And the precedents are the first ones who are close to those who are close to those who are close to obedience, and no doubt is obedient, and no doubt is that the prayer is from the obedience And the Almighty said: Those who are close to the limitation, so it is intended that it is not close to God except those who are the ones, and that indicates that it is like a way to the preference.And its elevation: His Excellency said: And hurry to forgiveness from your Lord [Al -Imran: 133] and the meaning: And hurry to what is required of forgiveness, and there is no doubt that the prayer is like that Amor.Fifthly: He praised the prophets who were presented with the Almighty saying: They were hurrying in the goodness [Al -Anbiya: 90] and there is no doubt that the prayer is from the good, for the good of the good Your prayers are prayer.And the sixth of it: He is the Almighty, he died in the height of the hurry, so he said: It is not forbidden for you not to prostrate when I commanded you [Al -A'raf: 12] and this indicates that the speed is left.And its sake: Its exaltation is said: they keep the prayers [Al -Baqarah: 238] and the preservation is only to be made by miracle, to secure the fatwa with the people of the people.And eighth: His Excellency said a story about Moses - peace be upon him -: I hurried to you, Lord, to be satisfied [Taha: 84], so I prove that the argument is the first.And the ninth: His Excellency said: It is not equal to those who agreed from before the conquest and the first of those who are greater than those who agreed from after and fought: Because of the increase in the virtue, so in this picture.And I see it: What was narrated by Omar, and Jarir bin Abdullah, Anas, and Abu Muhsour, on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: God, “The friend - may God be pleased with him - said: The contentment of God loves us from his forgiveness.” Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - said: The contentment of God is only for the good and the forgiveness is about to be from the palaces, for if this is said, this is in this way.Because it is necessary to sin at the last, and we are all over that he does not sin, so he remains only that it is that it is that the verb in the last time is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is obligatory And what was like that, he did not doubt that it was obligatory to be satisfied with God.We said: This is a weak from the faces: the first: that if it was like that, it was obligatory to be the most likely to be better, and that no one would say it.The second: that the large number of speeds to the compliance is like the numbers of the pests, and that requires punishment, except that when the act came after that, that fell.The third: that the interpretation of my father, the friend of the friend - may God be pleased with him - is invalidated by this interpretation that he mentioned.Haddi: It was narrated on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib - may God be pleased with him - on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: It is sufficient.The second is ten: “On the authority of Ibn Masoud, he asked the Messenger ﷺ and he said: That is, the best of the best.The third is tenth: Abu Hurairah narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “The man will pray the prayer and he has missed it from the first time (P-122) is what is better for him.” The fourth is ten: He said - peace be upon him -: The time is, so its rewards should be more than the reward of the late.The fifteenth: We agree that one of the causes of the guidance in between the companions is the righteousness of Islam, until the severe dispute between the people of the Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Sun He preceded the Islam or above, and that is nothing but their agreement on the fact that the stalking in the obedience requires the more virtue and that is indicated by our saying.The sixth: He said it - peace be upon him - in a speech to him: The four -year -old: that the righteousness of the Adamin is more preferred than its last, so the situation in the performance of God is the highest of that, and the whole of them is between them.The eighth is ten: that the initiative and the rushing to the prayer is a clearance of the molecule of obedience, the vowel with it, and the desire for it, and in the delay, it is a lazy for it, so the first is.The ninth is the tenth: that the stomach is to hurry the prayer; Because if He performed it at the beginning of the time.The stomach does not doubt that it is the first.The twenty: We are collected in the fast of Ramadan that it is more likely than its delay; That is because the sick person is permissible for him to break the fast and delay the fast, and it is permissible for him to hurry and fast on the time, then we all said that the ritual of the rituals said: Fastage is better for you [Al -Baqarah: 184] So it is also obligatory to be miraculous in the first prayer, so it was said: This is the indication of the evidence in the same way The hope for the realization of the group, or the existence of water, said: The delay has been established in these positions for knowledgeable matters, and our words are in the context of the original.The twentieth: the hurry to the compliance is better in the knowledge of the kneeling of the speed, so it is obligatory to be in the street as well as for his saying - upon him - peace be upon him - Good, it is good for God.The second and the twenty: a prayer is full of its parts, so it is obligatory to perform it at the beginning of the time, as the Maghreb, in it, it is excluded from the noon in the severity of the freedom; Because it is the delay, if he wants to pray it in mosques, for the sake of walking to the mosque in the severity of the free, as it is, but if it is in the house of it, then it is in its house The bit of the one who defends the two or the food is attended by the food, and it has hunger for this meaning as well, as well The group is that the fullness did not get in this image, for this is the evidence that indicates that the speed is better, and let us remember every one of the prayers: Muhammad: The desirable is to enter into it with the assassination, and it will come out of it with travel, so if he wants to be restricted to one of the two times, then the travel is better, and he said: Glory is more preferred, and it is the gold of my father (P -123) with a good and age, and with it he said your money, and Ahmad, and the Shafi’i transcended - may God be pleased with him - after the evidence of the evidence: I was brought out in the two valids with the wow of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that she said: The sitting said: “Muhi al -Sunnah said in the book“ Sharh Al -Sunna ”: Wrapped up with their descendants, that is, who are rejected by their essence The vast, one of it is a map, and the sitting: the injustice of the last night, if it was said: this was in the start of Islam when the women were attending the groups, so the Prophet was not.They are known, and so was Omar - may God be pleased with him - he prayed to the sitting, then when we forbade the presence in the groups that left that.We said: The origin of the reference to it in the proof of all rulings is the same as the copyist, and if not for this prayer, it is permissible for the sake of the sophisticated evidence.And the second: What was brought out in the two healths from Quta’a, on the authority of Anas, on the authority of Zayd ibn Thabt, he said: Fifty vessels, "and this also indicates the seizure.And the third of it: What was narrated from Abu Masoud al -Ansari, “The Messenger of God ﷺ was crucified with the morning, then he travels once, then he did not return to the travel until the sake of God.” And he paired it: He praised the praise of the people who forgiven the magicians, and he said: And those who seek forgiveness with magic They call their Lord fear and greed [Al -Sajdah: 16] and if this is proven, it is necessary to leave the sleep by performing the exhibitors better to say it - peace be upon him - peace be upon him - Those who are close to me, such as the performance of what I have assumed to them.Fifth: that the sleep in that time is good, and it will be more hard, so it must be more rewarding, for his saying - upon him - the peace of the peace - That is, the most difficult of it, and Abu Hanifa embraced Bojoh: one of them: his saying - peace be upon him -: And the second: “Abdullah bin Masoud narrated that he prayed the dawn with the righteousness, and he was sitting, and then Ibn Masoud said: I did not see the Messenger of God Fajr prayer, for it is a day for its meeqa.And the third of it: “On the authority of Ibn Masoud, he said: I have not seen the companions of the Messenger of God ﷺ they kept something.And he pushed it: On the authority of Abu Bakr - may God be pleased with him - that he prayed the immorality, and he read the family of Amran, and they said: The sun was almost to come up, and he said: He lived that he read the cow, so consult the sun, and he said: If she had come, we would not find it unaware.Fifth: that the late prayer is covered by the virtue of the waiting, and he said - peace be upon him -: Wait for the prayer first and then with it second, and whoever prayed it at the beginning of the time, then he missed it.And its sixth: The delay leads to the multiplicity of the group, so it must be the first to obtain the preference of the group.And the seven of it: that the seeding is shedding on people; Because if the prayer is at the time of the seizure, the human needed to perform the night until the prayer is free after the dawn, and the embarrassment is exile.And the eighth: that the prayer is distracted after the prayer By challenging, it is the time of hatred.The answer to the first: that the immorality is a name for the light in which the darkness of the deceased is denied, so the dawn is only a dawn, even if the darkness is in the darkness, then the darkness, then the darkness.With the kidneys and the wealth of the air, it was not a dawn, and the travels (P-124) is a dilemma of the appearance, it is said: The woman is traveling on the face of it, if it is clear, if it is clear.So we say: The appearance of immorality is only with the fight of darkness in the air, because the darkness is more severe, the more the light that appears in between that darkness, " With the dawn ““ must be prepared on the seizure, that is, whenever your prayers fall when the immorality was the appearance and the father was more rewarded, and there was no reward, and there was no reward.The immorality, and this is the meaning of the saying of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - that the travels are removed in the hadith that is based on the abundance of the dawn and the disappearance of the dawn, The performance of the prayer in that time is more difficult, so it is necessary to be more rewarding, and the delay of the prayer is to the time of the enlightenment, so it is the usual of the people of the lazy, so how can it Lashing is better than finding in obedience.The answer is about the second: It is the saying of Ibn Masoud: they keep the turning of the dawn, so his answer is this, which we decided, because the enlightenment is in the dawn, As for the world's lines of light, it is not called a dawn, and as for the sake of the faces, he is opposed to some of what we have provided, and God knows.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: What do you come to all of God, and it is a promise to the people of obedience, and a return to the people of disobedience, as if he said: And those who know the prophecies and the good deeds, and you will be buried in it to connect to the day of resurrection to what you have with God of the kinds of dignity and zipper, then it is the same With his saying: God is able to be able to do all of it, because the return in its soul is possible and he is able to appreciate all the possibilities.The one who dens from this verse, so we have mentioned it in his words, the Almighty: And if God wanted God, he would have gone with their hearing and their eyesight, God is all.[20]
