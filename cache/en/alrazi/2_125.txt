The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: And when we made the house a reward for people and a security and took from the shrine of Abraham, a prayer and our covenant to Ibrahim and Asmail, to purify me.And the kneeling is the prostration.We say: As for the house, it wants the forbidden house, and it is satisfied with the remembrance of the house as a divorce of the entry of the thousand and the blame for it, if you enter, or the one who enters the The addressees knew that he did not want the bush, and he was discharged to the bodies with them while he was the kaaba, then we say: It is not the same as the same as the same as the same.“Mother”, and this is the adjective of all of the sanctuary, not the row of the kaaba, only and the evidence is that it is permissible to release the house, and all the forbidden said: 95] It is all forbidden, not the same, because it is not slaughtered in the kaaba, nor in the mosque, the forbidden, as well [Al -Taba’a: 28], and God is the knowledge of the pilgrimage to attend the positions of the humanity, and he said in another verse: I did not see that we made us a safe and safe one [67] Another verse is expert from Abraham: Lord, make this country safe [Ibrahim: 35], so this indicated that he described the house with security, and he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the sake of the sake of the forbidden The house was preserved and all the sanctuary was concerned that the forbidden prohibition was when it was at the house, it is permissible to express it in the name of the house.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: a reward for people, who have books: the first question: The people of the language said: Its origin is from a steadfastness, a garment and a waters After his deduction, and he went to his mind, that is, he returned and separated from him, then they are fixed: that is, they returned to collectively, and the reward from (P-43) is that this is taken from it Other than him, he returned to him, and the garment of the well: the water gathered at the bottom, the lock said: It is a reward and a garment of two similarities: a shrine, and a place, and the one is a place, and it is a place, and it is a shrine, and it is a shrine, and it is a shrine, and it is a place, It was said: The distraction was entered into an exaggeration, as in their saying: a ratio and a science, and the origin of a stinging challenge [on the weight of] an act.The second question: Al -Hasan said: It is meaning that they will be given to him every year, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas and Mujahid: that he does not disagree with him, except when he comes to him, he said: Make a heart of people who love them [Abraham: 37] and it was said: a reward, that is, they perform Hajj for it and they will be rewarded for it, so it was said: the one who is a good Their return to it, and that is with their action, not by the verb of God, the Almighty, so what is the meaning of his saying And when we made the house a reward for people: As for our saying, the servant did a creature for God Almighty, so this verse is a pilgrimage to the saying of this The saying of the disgraceful, so it was intended that it is the highest of his greatness in the hearts to make that calling for them to return to it once after the last, but it is for you to do so The benefits of the world and the hereafter, as for the benefits of the world, because the people of the deceased and the Moroccan are gathered there, so there is there from the trading and the rituals of the place, what is the same And white, and it will be obtained by traveling to the pilgrimage to the way of the way and the country, and the witness of the different conditions in the world.As for the benefits of religion, because whoever intends the house a desire from it in the humanity and the approach to God Almighty, and the purification of the servitude to him, and the perseverance of the life and the ritual of the prayer The honorable mosque and the reward in it, it is necessary for that great reward for God Almighty.The second question: some of our companions are held in the hearts of life with the words of the high The house is a reward for people a news about that he has made it a description of a description of his being, but it is not possible People have a row that relates to the choice of people, and what is related to the choice of people cannot be obtained with mighty and dowry, and if you prove it, it will be excused, and it will be done.The verse is on the garment, because when we carried it on the garment, then it was led to his goodness, as well as if we carried it on the scarring, and it was proven that God has fulfilled our Lord Once, after the last, and we agreed that this must be fulfilled as it is only the tawaf, so it is obligatory to achieve it in the tawaf, this is the face of this More than those who spoke in the rulings of the Qur’an, they have been stabbed in the significance of this verse on this one who is required, and we have explained it to us from this one.As for his saying, the highest: and a security is a place of security, then there is no doubt that his saying: He made the house a garment for people and a security, and he is a little, and we have left it.He told him, and we will tell him about his appearance and say that it is an issue.As for the first saying: it is that what is meant is that he has made the people of the sanctuary safe from the drought and the dirt on what he said: I did not see that we have made us forbidden [67] We have not been able to have a safe sanctuary that the fruits of everything will be answered to it [Al -Qasas: 57] and it is not possible to be the one who is intended for the news of the abundance of the death of the killing in the death The murder may fall into it, and too, the murderer may be found in it, God Almighty said: Do not fight them when the mosque is the forbidden even They fight you in it, for if they kill you, kill them [Al -Qarra: 191], and he told the death of the killing in it.The second saying: that we carry it on the matter of the interpretation, and the meaning is that God Almighty commanded people that they make that place a mother of the slave of the caretaker, and the slave of the caretaker, and the slave of the cave, and the slave of the caretaker, With the judgment of God Almighty, and the ignorant people were holding (P-44) by prohibiting it, they do not irritate one of the people who sought refuge in it, and they were called the Quraysh: There is an issue of the hunter until the dog has a burning out of the sacrifice, so the antelope will be sacrificed, so the dog follows it, so if the oppressor enters the sacrifice, it will not be The news in the prohibition of Mecca, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “God forbids Mecca, and it is not permissible for anyone before me and does not come to anyone after me I was forbidden as it was, "and the Shafi’i went, may God be pleased with him, until the meaning: that it was not permissible for anyone to set the war on it, and that it is for you, and that it is for you, and that it is for you.He entered the house from those who have the limits, so the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The imam commands the adherence to it, and it is for what he leads to what he does not perform The limit was evaluated in the solution, for if he did not come out until he was killed in the forbidden, it is permissible, and so whoever fights in the forbidden is permissible to kill him in it, and he said: The father of Hanifah said: Al -Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, is that he, peace and blessings be upon him.Ali, Al -Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, said: And this is in the time that was in which it was forbidden, and it indicated that it does not prevent anyone from something that it is obligatory, and that it is that it is that it is that It is upon her as it is erected on others, and the father of Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, took this verse, and the answer to him is that he said: “And there is no one who does not have it.It will be a security of drought, and that it will be a security of the war, and that it will be a security from the residence of the limits, and the memorization is from the door of the general until the mother of the whole, but the mother of the whole From the drought and pests, the first because we are on this interpretation, we do not need a pregnancy to memorize the news in the sense of the matter and in the path of the faces we need this, so the saying First.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: And take from the shrine of Abraham, a prayer in it, in the issues: the first question: Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr, Hamza, and Asim, were read.And by breaking the khula on the form of the matter, and he read Nafaa and the son of Amir to open the khla in the form of the news.As for the first reader: he said it: and take a kindness on what, and it has sayings.The first: He was kind to his saying: Remember My blessings that I have been blessed with you and that I preferred you over the two worlds, and took from the shrine of Abraham.The second: He was kind to his saying: I make you an imam, and the meaning is that when they were afflicted with words and they have come, he said to him a reward for what he did, so he did not.And take from the place of Abraham, and it is permissible for him to be a matter of this, except that he is the Almighty, he said his saying and said, and his counterpart, and he said: With a force [Al -Arif: 171].The third: This is a matter of God Almighty for the nation of Muhammad ﷺ that they take from the shrine of Abraham a prayer He faced it: And when we made the house a reward for people and a security, and take you from the shrine of Abraham, a prayer and appreciation that I have honored it and described it as a good They took it as a kiss for yourself, and the wow and the fulfillment may mention each one of them in this situation, and if you are the fulfillment, it is clear, but whoever reads: Abraham that they took from his resort to a prayer, so this is a kindness on: “We made the house” and took it as a prayer They took it.The second question: Remember sayings that the place of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, is anything: the first saying: It is the place of the stone, upon which he is upon him, the peace be upon him.They mentioned two bodies: one of them: (p-45) that it is the stone that was the wife of Asmail, whom it was placed under the authority Peace be upon him, his man, upon him while he was a rider, and he washed one of his heads, then raised him from under him, and his man has grown up in the stone, and he was a man in the stone, so he was a man.The last one, and his leg was also in it, in which God made him an adult from his miracles, and this is the saying of good, mortality and the Lord of Anas.And the second: What was narrated from Said bin Jabir on the authority of Ibn Abbas that Abraham, peace be upon him, was building the house and Asmail, and he will be informed of the rituals: The hearing is the knowledge [the cow: 127].The second saying: that the place of Abraham is all forbidden, and it is the saying of a juvenile.The third: that it is a definition, the ritual, and the ritual, and it is the saying of a gift.Al -Rabaa: The pilgrimage is all the place of Abraham, which is the saying of Ibn Abbas, and those who investigate agreed that the first saying is the first and indicates that it is the first: Peace, when he emptied from the flood, the shrine came and followed his saying: And they took from the shrine That position indicates that what is meant by this memory is that position appearing.And the second: that this name in the norm is concluded with that position and the evidence that he asked if he asked the place of the king about the stature of Abraham, and he did not This position.And the third of it: What was narrated, “It is upon him peace be upon him, and Omar has passed with him, and he said: O Messenger of God, is this not the place of our father, Abraham?I am overwhelmed, so the sun did not miss the day until the verse was descended.And its booster: that the stone has become under his feet in the wetness of the clay until a man was wandered in it Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was his choice with Abraham, the first of his choice other than him, so the release of this name was upon him.Fifthly: He is upholstered, he said: And take from the place of his pillar, and there is no prayer for the prayer, and it is a matter Place.And its sixth: that the shrine of Abraham is the position of his resurrection, and it has been proven by the news that he rose up on this stone when he was seen, and he did not prove this, so he did not.I mean: the place of his wasting, peace be upon him, on the stone, will be the first.The man said: I took from a friend, and God has given me a good brother, and God gave me from you with a accompaniment, but you enter from the “Bayyan of the Mud and the Mawsuq” That is the meaning of others, and God knows.The third question: Remember the meant by his saying: a prayer of faces: one of them: the defendant prayer, so he made it from the prayer that is the supplication, God said: O God, O God: On him [Al -Ahzab: 56] and it is a saying of a Mujahid, but he went to this interpretation to fulfill his saying: All the sanctuary is the denomination of Abraham.And the second: Al -Hassan said: He wanted him before.And the third: Qatada and Al -Saddi said: They are commanded to pray with him.The people of verification said: This is the first saying that the prayer is preserved if it is released, the effective prayer is rejected by it, and it will not be found that you will not see that the prayer He prayed in the prayer of the Eid, and peace be upon him, and the son of Zayd: The prayer in front of you, meaning the place of the effective prayer, and the one who is the one who is the same The prayer has after the recitation of the verse, and because it is carried on the prayer of the graceful prayer, because it is a gathering of the captives of the suffering who is easy for the verse, and it is the same as it The rak'ahs of the float is a year or a year?It is looked if the flood is a cordon.On the authority of it in it: One of them is: a refusal to say it to the Almighty: and take from the shrine of Abraham, and the matter of the journey.And the second: a year of "peace be upon him, for the Arabs, when he said: Is it other than it, he said: No, only to float?A year and narration from Abu Hanifah, as well as in this question, and God knows.The following question: In the virtue of the house: The Sheikh narrated Ahmad al -Bayaki in the book of the people of faith on the authority of Abu Dhrar, who said: “ He said: The mosque is the forbidden, he said: I said then any?He said: Then the mosque is the Aqsa, I

Wahb ibn Muhbar, he said: The Adam of peace be upon him, when he was tied to the earth, he gave it to her, because he saw it, and because he did not see any of it, then he said: This is a mirror that

remembrance, and he will be blessed with me, and he will be blessed with me.From it a house, his choice for myself, and I specialize in my honor, and I will give it to all the lands of the earth, all

worship of God.And all of that is inside the words, then the interpreters mentioned its faces: one of them: that the meaning: purifying the two sons of his sons and purification from the evil, and he founded it, and he founded it, as well (P-48) The one who founded his two sons on the piety of God [Al-Tabah: 109].And secondly: People know that my house is a purification for them when they did it and visited him and resided in it, and his metaphor: Make it a clearance for them, as it is said: the one who is the one who is pleased with him Hanifah is impure.And the third of it: its sons and do

of the people, and if it is a prayer, it is from the prostration of prostration.The third question: this verse is indicated by matters: one of them: if we are pleased with the western people, then the verse indicates that the verse is for the sake of the rituals, from the rituals of the rituals, Because he is the Almighty, as he specialized in the circumambulation, indicating that they had more disturbing.It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, and Giving: that the ritual of the people of the associate is better, and prayer for the people of Mecca is better.And the second: the verse

whether it is in the matter of it Malik (P-49) by saying the Almighty: He gave your face to be the dominant mosque.His parts.(And the answer): The one who is the one who is the one who is evident to be augmented to every mosque, but it is necessary and it is augmented to a part of the parts of his part Likewise, it is obligatory to be inside the verse.And its elevation: that his saying: for the two families, the divorce of the circumambulation is on both, it was stipulated in it in the book of God Almighty, as the saying of the Almighty: 29] Or prove his judgment with the Sunnah, or was from
