The researcher of the Qurâ€™an is up to him: As for the human being, if his Lord is afflicted with him, he will be honored and blessed with him, so he says my Lord, October, and if he is afflicted, he will be able to say to him.Know that his saying is the Almighty, as the human being is attached to his saying: Your Lord is for the meteorology as if it was said: He is up to the forefront in the last, so he does not want For the last, the human being is only concerned with this world and its lusts and lusts, for if he finds the comfort in the world, he says: My Lord, I will come to me, and if he did not find this I congratulate me, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty in the attribute of the infidels: they know a phenomenon from the worldly life and they are about the hereafter they are heedless [Al -Rum: 7] and he said: And from the one who does not He was struck by the best of his reassurance, and if he was afflicted by a temptation, he turned on his face [Hajj: 11], and this is a mistake from his face And the slander is like the diameter in the sea, so the one who is blessed in the world, even if it was a hardship in the hereafter, is that of that, and it is not happy, and the one who needs in the world is not in the world.It is not insulting, nor a naughty, as the one who is blessed in the world is not permissible for him to judge himself with happiness and generosity, and the one who is in the world does not judge him.With the grief and love.And the second: that the obtaining of the blessing in the world and the arrival of pain in the world does not indicate the investigator, for it is the highness He rules what he wants, either by the ruling of reconciliation, or on the way of the pursuit and the deception, and it may be hungry on the two friends to add to what we remember, so do not mention what we have mentioned, so do not mention what we remember, so do not mention, so do not mention what we remember, so do not remember us That is for the rewards.And the third of it: that the completed does not want to be afraid of the punishment, for matters with its seeds, and the poor and the needy does not want to be forgiven by the one who is forbidden by God The peace of the body, the mind, the religion, and the payment of the pests and the pain that are not limited or limited, so it is not necessary to spend on its own insult to the insult.And its booster: that the soul has fulfilled these sensors, so when these cravings and pleasures were made, the dedication is difficult for them to be obedient to it, and the abuse of it, and the abuse of it.A person will get something of these sensors, she wore a mother, or she would refuse to God, and she works with the servitude of God, so it was the same as the slander of the world, for the sake of God It is permissible to eliminate the slander and insult at the world, with that, that the greatest of the liquids to the greatest of happiness.Fifth: that the multiplicity of practice is due to the confirmation of love, and the affirmation of love is confirmed because the pain is confirmed by the separation, so everyone was (P-155) More and Adam, his love was more severe, so he hurt it With her differences at the death, which is against the against the against the against the one, then it is the same as the same as the dominance of the heart, after the death of the death, after the death of the The hardship after the death, how is it said: The affliction of the world is happiness and its lack is a righteousness?.And I know that this face is valid with the saying of the Baath of the spirituality, whether it was or the body, but whoever denies the resurrection from all of the wives, then it is not Something from this face, but the piece is obligatory by the stroke that the affliction of the world is the happiness and its lack is the hardship, but it is in it, and it is a thickness of it.And the many afflictions of the world in the cause of the killing, the flame and the fall in the types of torment, as the deprivation was a reason for the survival of peace, so on this, it is not possible for the sake The resurrection is from all the faces to spend on the owner of the world with happiness and on the sake of its time, so that he will reveal to him that the situation after that.And in the verse as a question: The first question: His saying: As for the person who is intended for a certain person or the race?The answer: It is in it: The first: that what is meant by him is a specific person.Abi Bin Khawal, and a fighter said: She came down in the illiteracy of Bin Khawhal.And the second saying: that what was meant by the one who was described by this description, which is the unbeliever unbeliever to the day of the penalty.The second question: How did he call the basis of livelihood and its estimation of it?Answer: Because each of them is a woman who has been made to the servant, then if he is simplified, he has been tested by his condition, whether he is disbelieving, and if he is able to do it, then he will be taken.Or is it rewarded, then the rule is one, and the like is the Almighty saying: and we will give you evil and goodness.[Al -Anbiya: 35].The third question: When he said: He honored him, then it was true that he honored him and established that, then that when he told him that he said: My Lord is the best of him?The answer: Because the word of denial is his saying: (No), then it is not permissible to say: It is a specialist with his saying: my Lord, insulted our peace, that the denial is a good Three items: one of them: he met the inclusion of the investigator in that generosity.The second: that the blessings of God be upon him were seen before the emotions of money, and it is the blessing of the peace of the body, the mind, the mind, and the religion, so when it was not recognized by the goodness of the money It is not a widening of that thanks to the grace of God, but rather the crime of religion and the multiplication of money and children.The third: that it is composed with the grace of the world and its symptoms from the remembrance of the last rhythm, indicating his being denounced to the resurrection, so there is no generosity, so it is not the same That, he said: He entered his paradise while he was unjust to himself.He said what I think that this is ever alleged, and I do not think the hour is standing [the cave: 35-36] to its saying: I disbelieved with the one who created you from the dust [Al-Kahf: 37].The fourth question: Why did he say in the first oath: If his Lord is afflicted, then honor him and in the second division: As for if they are afflicted, he will be able to give him the first, then he will be blessed with the first And the answer: Because the mercy of God is a precedent on his anger and his absence with blessings, the precedent of his affliction with the removal of the pain, so the fulfillment indicates the many of the one who said: Do not count God, do not count it [Ibrahim: 34].The fifth question: When he said in the first section: He will be honored, so my Lord says, Oman, he must say in the second oath: And the answer: Because
