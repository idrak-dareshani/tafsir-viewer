The Quranic researcher (P-97) (Surah Quraysh), which is the four essential verses of the Meccan ﷽ for the Elaf Quraysh, they will be the nomad of winter and the fasting Institutions: The first question: the blame in its saying: (for Elaf), the three faces are enticed: it is either that it is attached to the wall, which is before it, or the one who is before it, or the one who is before it, or the one who is before it.Or do you not be attached to it, neither before it, nor after it.As for the first face: which is that it is attached to what is before it, then it has the advantages: the first: and it is the saying of the gospel and the father of Ubaidah that the estimation: he made them as a man For a thousand Quraysh, that is, the family of God, the companions of the elephant, to remain a Quraysh, and what has been fulfilled from the nomadic of the winter and the fast, for it is said: this is weak because they are as much Eating for their disbelief, and they did not make it like that to intimidate Quraysh.We said: This question is weak for his faces: one of them: We do not surrender that God is exalted, but he did with them that for their disbelief, for the part of the disbelieving, for the disbelief, Today, every soul is rewarded for what you have earned [Ghafir: 17] and he said: If God takes people to what they have earned what he left on its back from a bear [Fattar: 45] For their disbelief, it was done with all the infidels, but rather did that with them: for the first Quraysh and the greatest of their position.And secondly: He gave them that their miles from the infidels are intended, but it does not contradict the time of something other than what is meant until the judgment will be in the whole.And the third of it: He endowed that they were destroyed for their disbelief only, except that this is the property when it led to the Elaph of Quraysh, it is permissible to be said: they are for the sake Let them be an enemy and a sadness [Al -Qasas: 8] They did not pick it up for that, but when the matter is to him, it is good for him to be paved on him.(P-98) The second indifference: that the estimation will be: “Did you not see how your Lord did with the elephants of the elephants of the village of Quraysh” as if he said: “He said: For the village of Quraysh, it is the Almighty, he made them in misleading and sent to them a good man, until they became like a wallet, so that it was for all of you.The third indifference: that the pain is in his saying: (for Elaf) in the sense that he said: We did all that we did in the fence, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is a good The nomadic of the winter and the fasting says: The grace of God is a blessing, and a blessing of a blessing throughout the meaning, this is the saying of the conquest, so this is the same.Relax the mother with the wall that was before this, and the rest of this is the one who said: The first: The first: that people in the relationship of this mother of the mother: One of them: to make the two surahs one wall and begged him with Jajah: one of them: that The two surahs must be, and each one of them is independent of itself, and this surah is followed by what was attached to the wall of the one who is not the right.Transfer.And the second: that Abi Bin Kaab made them in his journalistic one surah.And the third of it: What was narrated is that Omar read in the prayer of the Moroccan in the first rak'ah and fig, and in the second, did you not see and to avoid the Quraysh with them, from the same way Merciful.The second saying: It is the one who is overwhelmed by this surah is separated from the elephant wall, and the first of this surah is related to what is before it, so it is not before it, so it is not before it Because the Qur’an is all the same as the one and the same verse, some of which are believed, and some of them are shown in the sense of one, not to see that the verses indicating the end of the end Considering the verses of repentance and the verses of pardon when he says to him, and his saying: We have sent down it [Al -Qadr: 1] He did not separate them from them, as it is opposed to the classes of everyone on the chapter between them, and as for the readings of Omar, it does not indicate that they are a single surah because the imam is the one.The second research: While it is related to this saying: Bayan is that what has become what God has done with the elephants of the elephants because of the village of Quraysh?So we say: There is no doubt that Mecca was free from the cultivation and the burden on what the Almighty said: with a good one who has a cultivation [Ibrahim: 37] to his saying: So make the people of the people And give them out of the fruits [Ibrahim: 37], so the supervision of the people of Mecca were to dissolve to merchants, and these two nomads are, and they come to themselves and for the people of them From the taste and clothes, and they were only in their travels, and because the murdered aspects were glorified by the people And the rulers of the kaaba even that they were calling the people of the people of God, and if it would have been done for the dungeon, they would not be determined by the destruction of the kaab, and this is still from them, and this is still from them.Grandfismatic and honorable, and the inhabitants of the Mecca of the Population of the Circles of the Laws became kidnapped from every side and it is exposed to them in their souls and their aspirations.The elephant, and their affliction in their sacrifice is the increase in the people of Mecca in the hearts, and the increasingness of the busts of the boundaries of them, so that these benefits and the waging of them said: How to do your Lord with the friends of the elephant [Al -Fil: 1] for the village of Quraysh...The nomad of winter and the fast.And the second face, while it is indicated by the health of this saying: that his saying is up to the end of this surah: Let them worship the Lord of this house, which is the one who is the one who is a sign of the first He said: (P-99) Let them worship the Lord of this house, He intended the elephant companions, then the Lord of the house paid them away from their intention for the sake of your wandering and your benefit is that the matter of worship is good, but it is good for me It indicates the first attachment of this surah to the advanced wall.The second saying: that the blame is in: (for Elaf) is attached to his saying: (Let them worship), and he is the saying of the Khalil, his Siboi, and the ability: Let them do this Quraysh.That is, to make their worshipers a thank you for this grace and confessing it, then it was said: So the fulfillment entered in his saying: (Let them worship)?We said: Because in the words of the condition, and that is because God bless them is unrepentant, so it was said: If he did not worship him for his blessings, let him be blessed with him The one that is a phenomenon.The third saying: that this mother is not attached to it, not what before it or after it, the gospel said: The people said: This is the mother of the mother, as is the mother of the mother, as is the mother of the mother, as is the mother of the mother.For the village of Quraysh, and that is because they are every day they are in absentia, ignorance and savings in the worship of the second, and God is the highest of them, and the lesions are paid from them They are their affiliations, and that is not doubt that it is in the end of the admiration of the greatness of the dream of God and his generosity, and his counterpart in the language is your saying: for our goodness!And for Zaid and our grammar!This is the choice of the Kisi, the fearful and the vastness.* * * The scholars of the language said: I wrapped the thing and wrapped it with a thousand, a thousand and a fabric in one means, that is, I had it, so it will be the meaning of the thousand Quraysh, and the one who is the one who is the same.It was interrupted, and Abu Jaafar read: “For a thousand Quraysh” and the others read: “For thousands of Quraysh”, and Akrama read: “For a village of Quraysh”.And the second: that this is from your saying: I have been a position like this and God is his time, as you say: It has a kindness.He has a thousands of himself, and his thousands are other than him, and the meaning is that this is a thousand, but it was obtained in the Quraysh with the mobilization of God, and it is like the one who said: And he said: So he wrapped between your hearts, and you have become a brotherhood of his blessing [Al -Imran: 103] And the prisoner may be a reason for the obstacles and the agreement, as it was, as it was, as it was.For Quraysh, then the source will be added to the verb, and the meaning will be for the sake of God to make a Quraysh a mandate for their merciful.And the third: that the elasticity is the end and the confiscation, which is the saying of the abundance and the son of the Arab, so the source will be on this saying added to the subject, and the meaning: the meaning: She passed it down to communicate and not cut off, and Abu Jaafar read “to Fil”, with a thunder, so he was omitted the thunderbolt of the actions, and he was all in the same way “They are mocking” and its report has passed.The third question: the release in its saying: for the village of the village of their elapses is that it is the first to release the first and then make the restriction to the one for that, for the sake of the divorced woman Elaf and a reminder of the greatness of the one in it, and the closeness is that it is his saying: for the first Quraysh in general, all the obstacles and agreement are collected between them, and they are among them And all of their conditions, then the two nomads were specially mentioned by the remembrance of their pensions, as they say it as saying The alert is that all the grace says, the Arabs say: I have like that, that is, his necessity, and commitment are beaten: an obligation to the cost and the matter, and a commitment to the affiliation, then it is the affiliation.The woman is something that he had, and it is: and the word of piety [Al -Fath: 26], just as the abandonment is two: The second: to ask for great benefit, as whoever finds great money and no prohibited from taking it, neither a mind nor a law, or a sense, for it is like the one who refuses to take, and the reasons for the reference ( Without the abandonment, once the payment of the relics and the last of the ritual of the benefit, which is what is meant in its saying: (Eleven).The following question: They agreed that Quraysh was born of Al -Nadr ibn Kananah.In the causes of this name, it is one of them: it is the microcosm of the penny, which is a great bear in the sea, which is tired of the bversary Abbas: What was the Quraysh?He said: A category in the sea is eaten and not eaten.It is known that a Quraysh is the same as the attributes because it follows the nation of the nation, because the imams are from Quraysh.And the second: It is taken from the sink, which is the gain because they were a cup of their traces and their confusion in the country.And the third of it: Al -Laith said: They were separated from the forbidden, so they gathered the story of Bin Kalb in Al -Harim until they took it as a dwelling, so they called it the Quraysh.It is said: The people are discussed if they are gathered, and that is called a collective story.They used to fill the immorality of the pilgrim, so they called a Quraysh, because the sarcasm of the arrival said that Ibn Hariyah said: Oh, the sham, the one who is the one who is from us His Excellency said: The nomadic of the winter and the fasting in it in it: Say: The first: It is The famous, the interpreters said: It was for the two nomadic nomads in the winter to the Yemen The cause in that is that if a single of them hit one of them, he was brought out by his and his families to a position and they were beaten on themselves, until they died, until they came, until they came, until they came, until he came to Hashim, until he came.The master of his people, and he had a son who was said to him: a lion, and he had a raised from the sons of Mukhtum that he loves and played with him, and he will be blessed to him.So I was sent to those who are very tight and greedy, and they lived in it for days, and then a lion came to him once again, and he complained to him from hunger, so he said: You have become a newborn in which you will be said and humiliated, and you are the people of the forbidden of God and the honor of the son of Adam and the people for you.They said: We are a follower of you, so there is no disagreement for you, so all the sons of the father have gathered on the winter in the winter to the Yemen The jurist until their poor was like their sang They are their richness in their richness ∗∗∗ until they are their poor, such as the sufficient, and I know that the face of the grace and the good in it is that if the people of the elephant would not have been done, they did not want, and they did not want to Also, they were separated, and their condition became like the states of which are mentioned in his saying: and we cut them in the land of the nations [Al-A'raf: 168] (P-101) and the meeting of the one in the same way The blessing is that the pleasure is from the domes of various, and alerted to the Almighty that from the condition of the traveler and the thousand, and from it the saying of the Almighty: and there is no righteousness in the pilgrim: [197] To the ethical dignity of the residence.The second saying: that what is meant is the passion of people to the people of Mecca, the joy of the winter and the fasting is a righteous and pilgrimage, because it was one of them, and the last of them is the same The benefits of Mecca will be with them, and if he had the elephant's friends, what they wanted, this is the benefit.The second question: the parking of the nomadic, with their effective, and he wanted the nomads of winter and the fast, so he turned to the security of the dress as a whole: Your stomach, and it was said: the nomadic of the winter and the passion of the fasting, and the reciter of the “nomadic” by the guarantee of the back, which is the side.
