The Quranic researcher is the fourth: from the sentence of the revelation, the Almighty said: And when the servant of God prayed, they called him, they would be on him for the sake of the servant of God.The whole, then the one said: This is one of the words of heaven, not from the total of the inspired; Because the Messenger is not worthy of talking about himself with the memory of the Maghreb, and this is not far, as in his saying: The day we will be gathered to the righteous and the righteous: And most of them are from the sentence of the inspired; If he was one of the words of jinn, he would not be the words of heaven.And in the violation of what is the words of jinn, distant from the peace of the arrogance, and the extension of this difference is that whoever made him from the sentence of the inspired, then he opened the gossip in that, and whoever made it, and whoever makes it, We explain the verse on the two sayings, but for the saying of those who said: It is from the sentence of the inspired, and the guarantee is in his saying, they are almost to those who return?There are three faces in it: one of them: to heaven, and the meaning of his invitation, that is, he worshiped his worship, he wants his resurrection to the prayer of the dawn, when he came to him, so they heard the readers, so they can be the readers, so they can That is, they will be overwhelmed by those who like what they have seen from his worshipers, and to hurt his companions with him, standing, rising, and prostrating.And admiration for what was followed by the Qur’an, because they saw what they did not see the same, and they heard what they did not hear the same.The second: When the Messenger of God came to worship God alone, contrary to the participants in their second worshipers, the participants almost to be of the most insignificant His enmity, they are overwhelmed by him.And the third: It is the saying of a murderer, when the servant of God rose, man and ginger showed, and they appear on him to invalidate the truth that he came to and guided by God He will support him and show him to those who are normal, and on the saying of those who said: It is one of the words of jinn, and the vagina is also a source in it, and he said: Some of it on one another, and some of it was on one another, and everything I attached to something hard, so it was lost.It is said: The lion's beginning is what the poetry is replaced between his shoulders, and from it the saying of Zahir: (p-145) ؎ [Lion of the complainant of the weapon, the slander of it] Repented and read: “Bedouin” by the light of the mother and the appearance in the sense of eternity, and the beginning of the gathering of a mosque and a prostration.He was also read: “Badd” by the light of the mother and the gathering of the core like a patience with patience.??We said: Because if these words are from the sentence of the inspired, the one who is the humor of the Messenger is to mention itself with the slave, and if it was from the words of the jin With the servitude of God, the infidels of the infidels are why they gathered and did not try to prevent it from it, with that that is the agreement to the laws of the mind?.
