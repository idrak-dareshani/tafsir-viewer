The researcher is the Almighty: and you will not be satisfied with you, nor the Christians until you follow their mill We know that it is up to the Messenger when he was patient with what was presented from the verse and indicated that the cause has been displaced by him, not from them, and that there is no one in them.It follows that, that the people reached their condition in their hardness in their void and their steadfastness on their disbelief that they want with that to be with them, and they do not follow them.In the book, but they want to agree to them, as they are upon him, so he has shown that the intensity of their hostility to the Messenger and explained what is required of the mourning of them He said: Say that the guidance of God is the guidance in the sense that the guidance of God is the one who guides to Islam, which is the guidance of the truth and who is correct to be called a guidance, and he is all the guidance, and it is not behind it, and it is not behind it.With a guidance, but it is a fun, not to see it to say it: and if you follow their whims, that is, their sayings that are whims and bits, after the one who came to you from the knowledge The heir is what you have from God from my guardian and no support, that is, a certain one who disobeys you and melts from you, but God protects you from people if you reside on obedience and standing with his love.They said: The verse indicates matters from it that the one who has learned from him that he does not do the thing, it is permissible for him to be entrusted to him on his deeds, so in this way, it is in this He follows their whims and with that, so he has been rejected by him and his counterpart, saying: If you share it, your work is made [Al -Zumar: 65] The one who is pleased with that act is this return or this return is one of his streets.And the second: that his saying: After the one who came to you from the science, it indicates that the return is permissible until after the installation So he said the saying of those who permit an unbearable deposit.And the third of it: there is a sign of that following the passion is only false, so from this direction, it is indicated by the heroic of imitation.And its seed: there is no significance that there is no lips to the heavy punishment, because it is not the Messenger if he followed his life, even if he found an intercession and a victory for you Weak, because following their passion (P-30) is unbelievers, and when we do not have an intercession in the infidelity.The Almighty said: Those who have come to the book, they recite the right to recite it, those who believe in it and those who disbelieve in it, then those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first The first question: those whose position is raised by the appetite, and those are a second start, and they believe in it.The second question: what is meant by saying: those who have come to the book from Are they?In it is the saying: The first saying: that they are the believers who God has brought to the Qur’an and begged him from his face And the desire for the recitation of this book, and a praise for that recitation, and the book that this is the Qur’an, not the supply and the Gospels, for their readers are not.And the second: that his saying is the Almighty: Those who believe in it indicates that faith is defined to them, and if what was meant was the people of the book, it would not be like that.And the third: Its saying: And whoever disbelieves in it, those are the losers and the book that this description is perfect.The second saying: that what is meant by those whom the book has given, they are those who believe in the Messenger from Jew Their methods and told them their misfortunes, followed by the praise of those who left their methods, but the meditator contemplated the teeth and left its warning and the knowledge of it.Peace be upon him.As for the saying of the Almighty: they follow the right to recite it, so the recitation has two meanings: one of them: the readers.The second: The follower is a verb, because whoever follows others is said to be a verb.All the void is because the follower of others may fulfill the right to follow, so it does not give up anything from it, and the following is the following, the right to the right of it, so it is not the right of it.And those who interpreted it on the readers who were the ones who disappeared on its face And others.And the second: that they were subjected to his recitation, and they were afraid if they read the Qur’an in their prayers and their cells.And the third of it: they did with his judgment and believed in his similarity, and they stopped in what I have formed from them and delegated him to God.And its booster: they read it as God descends, and they do not perpetuate the word from its positions, and they do not interpret it on the other.Fifth: that the verse be carried on all of these faces because it is a shared in one concept, and it is its greatness, and the purpose is for it, and it is not.This is the blessed destiny, as many of the words of God Almighty, and God knows best.
