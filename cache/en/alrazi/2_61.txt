The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, and when you said, Yamusi, we will not be patient with one food, so let us be your Lord, to bring us what the land is alert Do you rely on the one who is the lowest in the one who is the best of Egypt With the verses of God and kill the prophets, without the truth, that is what they disobeyed, and they were accustomed to knowing that the known readers come out to us with the sake of the yaa, And the bridge of the B, and the son of Ali, the son of Ali, read the conquest of the ya, and the recession of the Arabs, and I would grow up with the opening of the vit.The question was disobedience, and when we are not like that, and the evidence is that he said that he said: Eat and drink from (P-92) before this verse is from the one who is the one who is the same.Rather, it is a pornography, and if it is like that, they are not saying: We will not be patient with one food, so let your Lord be disobedient for us, because whoever prays from the food of the food is from the food It is not for that either his soul or on the tongue of the Messenger, so when he had that if they asked Moses to ask that from his Lord, the supplication was close to the answer, and it is permissible for you A disobedient.He knew that the question of other types of food is enticed to be for purposes: the first: that when they took over that one of the ages of the age of four years.The second: Perhaps in the origin of the creation, what they used to return to that type, but rather they used to the birds of the types and the desire of the human being as he used to the origin of the educator, even if it is a liking While he did not accommodate him, even if he was a mourning.The third: Perhaps they are bored of staying in the end, so they asked this feeding that is only found in the country and their supplies are reaching the country, not the same.The lord: that the perseverance on one food is due to the lack of lust and the weakness of the digestion and the lack of desire, and the abundance of species is appointed to the thief The time, so it was proven that the type will be made with the type, it is possible for the minds to be the mind, and it has proven that there is no way in the Qur’an that it indicates that they were not.She proves that this destiny is not permissible to be a disobedience, and what is confirmed is that his saying is up to the Almighty: Slow Egypt That is the question, because the answer was a disobedience to it, and it is not unable to the prophets, it is not said: when they refused something that God has chosen for them, he gave them an urgent one who said: The world is its result from it [Al -Shura: 20] because we say this is the disagreement It was a disobedience to the faces: the first: that their saying: We will not be patient with one food that they have been disturbed by the removal of Mina and Al -Salwi, and that disobedience is disobedient.The second: that the saying of Moses, peace be upon him: do not replace the one who is lowest in the one who is the best of understanding on the path of denial, and that indicates that it is not.The third: that Moses, peace be upon him, described what they asked that he was the lowest and what they were upon him is good and that indicates what we said.And the answer to the first: that it is not under their saying: We will not be patient with one food that is on the authority that they were not satisfied with it, but only, and it is not, but it is a thing, but it is a matter of one, but it is a matter of one, but it is a thing, and it is not.We will not be patient with the future, because a word will not be exiled in the future, so it does not indicate that they were planned.And on the second: that the questioning of the path of denial may be because of the death of the benefit in the world, and it might be because it is in the death of the benefit.And on the third: with a relative of that, the thing has described it that it is better than where the intended is present, and it is not possible, and from where it is, it is not possible.The present, then it is said in the absent who doubts in it: it is lower than where it is not certain and from where it is not connected to it except for hardly, so it is not forbidden to be the same In the same way, it is the best of this meaning or some of it, and it was proven by what we mentioned that that question was not disobedient, but it was a permissible question, and if it was the same, then it was said: And the righteous, and they are angry from God, it is not permissible to be for what was presented, but rather what God has mentioned, after that, and he said: “That was the Almighty.And they kill the prophets without the right, and he indicated that he was the one who was the humiliation (P-93) and the accommodation of them and made them the place of anger and the punishment of the one who did not.That.The second question: His Excellency said: We will not be patient with one food that is not intended that it is one in the species, but it is one in the approach, and it is as it is said: One food if it does not change its approach.The third question: the well -known reader: its clicks by breaking the endowment, and read the Amash, the slave, and its cliches, by adding the righteousness and the well -known readings: and its mourning from the authority of the Masoud and her garlic, which is the reader of Ibn Abbas, they said: This is a horizon for the remembrance of the connection and they were different in the foam, so Ibn Abbas was the one that is the savage, and it is also that it is that it is The narrator is about Mujahid, Ata, and Ibn Zaid, and it was narrated from some Arab And beg on him with Jajah: The first: that he is in the ritual of Abdullah bin Masad and their garlic.The second: that what was meant, even if it was the stomach, it is not permissible to say: they will be spared who is the lowest in the one who is better because the bowl is the honor of the food.The third: that garlic wakes up to the missionary and the connection from the bow.The following question: the well -known reader: you will be spoken and in the letter of Abi Bin Kaab: Debt.And they differed in what is meant by the lowest and the saying in it is that what is meant is either that it is a lower in the prayer in the religion or in the benefit in the world, and the first is the one who is the first He had to be in the door of religion from the one who asked him for what was permissible to answer them to him, but he had answered them to him by saying: “Do not ask you,” It is what is meant by the one who is used in the world, then it is not permissible for what is meant is that this type that you have is better than those who ask for what is the food that is not the food Feeding when a people may be the brother of it, but what is meant is what we have shown that the one who and the peace be upon us is the time of the crops and what they ask for, and what they ask for the sake It is better than the doubts or because this gets from others and is not tired, and that is only with hardship and fatigue, so the first is the first.If it was said: It was for them to say this, who is pardoned by a row when we hated it with our goods, and his custody was more difficult than the one who does not get it except with us.We said: He gave the opposition to this side, but it was sought by the risk since the exact present is more likely to be suspicious.The fifth question: the well -known reader: they are fractured by breaking the B and reading the sake of the B.The famous readings: Egypt with the collaborators, but it was shrouded with the fulfillment of the two captives in it, which is the definition and the insult to the one who is a place and its righteousness is like: Lotion [Al -Anam: 86] and in which the legendary and the definition, even if the country wants it, then what is in it is only one reason As his saying: Enter Egypt [Yusuf: 99] and missed those who said in his saying: Press Egypt, narrated from Ibn Masoud and Abu Bin Kaab.Al -Tawniyeh, and Al -Hassan said: The thousand in (Egypt) is an increase in the writer, so that it will be known.Pharaoh, which is narrated from Abu Al -Aali and Al -Rabi’a, and those who read the inclusion, which is the famous reader, they have disagreed, so whoever said: Pharaohs and the entry of those who are in it in it as his entry into Noah and Lot, and others said: What is meant by the entry of any country was as if they were told to enter.A country that is a country that you would find in these things, and in the sentence, the interpreters have disappeared in the fact that what is meant by Egypt is the country in which they were first or first Many of the interpreters: it is not permissible for it to be the country in which they were with Pharaoh and they needed it with the words To you and do not find your lines [Al -Maaidah: 21] and the recipient of this verse from three of the faces: The first: that his saying is up to the Almighty: Enter the earthly land, and the sacred land is positive.And that is required to be forbidden from the entry of another land.In prevention from the time of the sanctuary.[Al -Ma’idah: 26] If this matter is presented, then the Almighty indicates that they are varied from its entry.It is permissible for the one who is intended to be from Egypt.We are tired of entering the sacred land with the entry of Egypt.The scarf.As for the third, it is the saying of the Almighty: and do not find your aspirations.While you are commanded by the Arabs, you say to those who disobey with what he commands him: He is returned to his punishment.This is allocated by a certain time.To be deleted, but the authorization is in its leaving it, then it is permissible in leaving the delegate, and that is not met by the prophets.We said: The evidence is upon him that when he commanded the income of the sacred land, then he said after him: And do not worse on your admire That is the matter.Egypt, Pharaoh, and begged him with two John: The first face: If we read: A country A dumping of this title, except for this inspired country.On the science of his pregnancy, like the one who is an unjust and a juvenile, then when they came to two flags, their pregnancy was on the first of the scholars.But if we read it with the inclusion, then we will make it with that name of a science and say: He entered into it in it, and it is not in it, and it is in it, as it is in it.The report also came with his eyes, but if we made it the name of an angelic, then the Almighty said: Surprise Egypt, it requires the seduction, as if he said: The release between all the neck of the world.The second face: that God is the Almighty and inherited the children of the land of Egypt, and if it was a juvenile, they will be forbidden to forbid them to enter it, and that it is that it is the right of it.So we brought them out of gardens, eyes, hills, and a generous position [Al -Shua’ar: 57] to his saying: Likewise, and we inherited it from the children That they are not entered from its entry, because the inheritance benefits the king and the king is divorced to expire.If it was said: A man may be a money for the house, even if it is varied from her entry with another man, as is the case with those who are obligated to himself, and he will be rewarded for the days of the day (P-95) It was bored with him, but he was forbidden to enter it, so why is it not permissible to say: God has inherited Egypt in the sense of the mandate, and the wasting of it, It is for them to enter it from where they are obliged to live in For the shortness and prevention of the disagreement, the first of the evidence answered, the first of the two pilgrims, which were mentioned by the father of a Muslim, said: The first one is the one who is the one who is the first We hold the famous rule, which is in which it is noticed.His saying: This reading requires the choice.As for the second direction: the answer to it is that we do not fight that the property is divorced to the behavior, but this is left for this prayer, such as the bitter and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the time The original for what we presented is from the sign.As for the saying of the Almighty: the humiliation was attached to them, so the meaning was made by the humiliation surrounded by them until they are comprehensive, so they understood in it, so they are in it.I was affixed to them until they were obligated to be a beating, as the clay is struck on the wandering, so it is obligatory and the closest in the humiliation is that what is meant is what is going to be the one who does Like his words, he is the one who is fighting and spoiling: that has a treacherous in the world [Al -Mawdida: 33], but whoever says It is intended for the reward, especially for what the Almighty said: until they are given the reward from a hand while they are silent [the repentance: 29], so he said it is far from the fact that the reward was from the reward of what was the reward.First matter.As for the saying of the Exalted: The Fakisah is what is meant by the poverty and the horizon and the tightening of the insult, so this sex is permissible to be like a punishment, and from the scholars of the scholars of this Because he, peace be upon him, told him about the sake of the humiliation and the dwelling of them, and the matter was signed, so it was this news about the unseen, so it will be miraculous.As for the saying of the Exalted: they are in the face of his faces: one of them: the budget is the return, so he said: “They came”, that is, they returned, and they were disgraced with that, and it is not said.And the second: the prolonged pear.And he said: “Well,” that is, the level of God's anger.Al -Zajaj said it.And the third of it: they have been fulfilled, and it is the Almighty saying: I want to seek ice and your iniquity [Al -Maaidah: 29] that is, you deserve all.As for the anger of God, it is the will of righteousness.As for his words, the Exalted: That is that they were atone for the verses of God, so it is a cause for what his remembrance offered from the harm of humiliation and the peace be upon them.The disgrace said: If the disbelievers would have obtained the creation of God, the Almighty, as you got the humiliation and the dwelling in them with his creation, when he was not made by it The opposite, and its opposing answer with knowledge and preacher, and the truth of the infidels, the saying was presented in it.As for the words of the Almighty: they kill the prophets, without the truth, the meaning is that they deserve what is presented for the sake of these actions as well as in it.The first question: that his saying is up to the Almighty: they will atone for the income of the killing of the prophets, so he did not re -mention it again?.The answer: The masculinity is the disbelief in the verses of God, and that is the ignorance and the norm by its verses, so it does not enter the killing of the prophet.The second question: Why did he say: Without the right and killing the prophets, it is only on this direction?.5 Because he came to him, he truly believed him for a lord that fell in his heart and may come to him (P-96) with his knowledge of his being false, and there is no doubt that the second is the second: And they kill the prophets without the truth, that is, they kill them from others if that killing was truly in their arrests and their imagination, but they were two scholars with his grape Do it.And the second: that this release is for the sake of affirmation, as the Almighty saying: And whoever calls with God is another God, and there is no proof of it with him [the believers: 117] The second God is a proof.And the third of it: that God is exalted, if he had forgiven them on the murder of killing, they said: Is it not that God kills them, but he is upholstered, he said: The killing of the one who is killed by God, whoever kills, is the killing of God.Other than the right.* * * As for His Excellency said: That is what they disobeyed, so it is certain that the repetition of the thing is unlike the first memorizer, and it is in a house that the man says to his servant and his servant of his servant and his servant of his servants From him, he punished him when the last of it: this is what you disobeyed me and I violated my matter, this is what you have done to me and I was deceived by my dream, and this is with such; His sins are prepared for him with a different clearance.As for the saying of the Exalted: They were accustomed to, so what is meant by the injustice: that is, the right to the right to falsehood.And know that he was exalted when he mentioned the removal of the holy ones with them, between the cause يَتْلُوهُ في العِظَمِ وهو قَتْلُ الأنْبِياءِ ثُمَّ ثَلَّثَهُ بِما يَكُونُ مِنهم مِنَ المَعاصِي الَّتِي تَخُصُّهم ثُمَّ رَبَّعَ بِما يَكُونُ مِنهم مِنَ المَعاصِي المُتَعَدِّيَةِ إلى الغَيْرِ مِثْلَ الِاعْتِداءِ والظُّلْمِ, This is in the end of the good deeds.If it was said: Hahna said: And they kill the prophets, without the truth, the truth is mentioned in the mouth and the blame is known The prophets without the right [Al -Amran: 21] is a denial, and that is in this surah: and they kill the prophets with the right to the right of that Amran: 112) What is the difference?.The answer: The right -known right between the Muslims who requires the killing, peace be upon him said: “A Muslim is not permissible except for one of the three times of three After a fortress and killed a soul without a right.A truth, not this, which is known to the Muslims, nor is it a bit.
