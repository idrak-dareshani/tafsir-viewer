The researcher, who is a drink, said: It is up to the eyes of the eye, which has ended his atmosphere, which has ended his freedom from the confiscation in the sense of delay.In the hadith: “A man delayed the presence of the group, then he exceeded the neck of the people, so the Prophet said to him ﷺ: You have been hurt and hurt.Between Humim Ann [Al -Rahman: 44], the interpreters said: Its movement was reached to where it was signed from it, a country on the mountains of the world, it is dissolved.As for their stomachs, the Almighty said: They have no food except from a bush, and they differed in the fact.What is it?On Wahwah: One of them: Al -Hasan said: I do not know what the domestication is, and I have not heard anything in it.And the second: It was narrated from Al -Hasan, too, that he said: The deposit in the sense of the one is like the imam, the hearing and the bodies in the sense of the teacher, the hearing, and the one who is a food, They shift and humiliate it with his enemy because of the roughness, the roughness, the roughness, and the free.And the third of it: that the deprivation is what is wore from the Shabraq, and it is a sword of the thorns, the camels are sponsored by the camel as long as it is moisturizing, so if it wears it, it is a fatal poison.Ryan even if he domesticates and returns a constraint from which the score is returned to the collection of examinations, which is the one who is from the camels, and this is the saying of the most interpreters and the most families of the language.And his booster: Al -Khalil said in his book: It is said to the gloriousness that is on the bone under the meat is the domestication, as if it is up and described it with a little, then there is no generosity.Fifth: Abu al -Jawza said: The sake of the lust, and the approach of it was narrated from it from Saeed ibn Jubayr that it is a tree with a thorns.Shawk!And in the news: the deprivation is something that is in the fire, the thorns is a matter of patience, and it comes from the goodness and the most freedom of the fire.The end of their humiliation, and that, because the people, when they resided in these situations and the yields of that long time, are hungry, and then they were thrown into the fire, and they were watered, and they were watered, So those people loved the silence of their thirst and hunger, and they found the water, and the water does not narrate, but it is a distraction, and they found the plants of what is not saturated, and they are not sacrificed And their greed in removing their hunger and thirst, as he said: If they seek help, they will be relieved with water like the least [the cave: 29] and it was clear that this is not the case.God is from it, and we are asking: the first question: He said in the surah of Al -Hakiyah: He will not have a fool and no food for him today.[Al -Ghashiyyah: 6] and Al -Dahari is not washing.The answer is from two voices: the first: that the fire is a driver, so it is among the people The washing, (P-140), and some of them are the foolish food, and among them is the drink of Hamim, and among them is the drink of the friend, each of them is a part of a divided.The second: It is impeded that the washing is from the sacrifice and that is like his saying: my food is only from the sheep, then he says: Male is food except from the milk, and there is no one from the milk, and there is no time.The second question: How does the Prophet find in the fire?Answer: From two voices: The first: It is not intended that the deprivation is a prophet in the fire, they eat it, but it is an atmosphere like it, that is, that they are not satisfied with what they do not.He is tormented by his depths.The second: Why is it permissible to say: The plant is found in the fire?For when the human body was not followed with the right of the human being with me and blood in the fire, the Abad began, so it is like here, and so is the saying in the peace of the fire, the sins of the fire.
