The researcher knew that he is the Almighty when he mentioned the feast of the infidels, followed him by the believer, and he said: Those who fear their Lord with the unseen of them are forgiven and forgiven.The first face: that what is meant is: those who fear their Lord while they are in the house of expression and the theoretical knowledge and they have a need for the slave of the Satan and the payment of the semi.The second direction: This is a sign of it as a longing from all sins; Because whoever fears the sins of God in the trait, where people see, there is no referral, and our companions took this verse on the abuse and the feast of the immorality, so they said: Supported with this roughness, then he has the great reward, so if the day of resurrection comes with immorality and with this fear, then he will get the two things, then he will be done Battle, or he is punished, then transferred to the house of reward, which is the one who is required.And know that he was upset when he mentioned the feast of the disbelievers and returned the believers on the path of the Maghreb, he returned after that to the discourse of the disbelievers, and he said: He knows the same breasts and in it and Jahan: the first face: Ibn Abbas said: They used to obtain from the Messenger of God, and Jabril told him, and he said to each other.Lest, Muhammad does not hear, then God will descend this verse.The second saying: It is a general discourse for all creation in all the businesses, and it is meant that your saying and your work on any path is found, for one is the same in the knowledge of it Conclusion, as they are prevailing for it (P-59), because it does not avoid this with the lineage to the knowledge of God Almighty, and as it was clear that he is the highest scholar, and he is a scholar who is a family With the stomachs of hearts.Then it is up to the one who mentioned it as a world of wickedness, the secret, and what is in the breasts.And it contains the issues: the first question: that the meaning of the verse is that whoever creates something that must be a scholar with his creatures, and this is the present as it is, as it is the same as it is the same Decide of the mental signs; That is because creation is a reflection of creation and formation on the way of intent, and the one who is intended to something is necessary and that it is a scholar of the truth of that thing, for the one who is the thing, for the one who is the thing, for the one who is the thing, for the one who is the thing, for the one who is the thing, for the one who is the thing, for the one who is the one who is the thing, for the one who is the one who is the one who is the thing, for the one who is the one who is the thing, for It is evident that he is intended for him, and as it is proven that the Creator must be a scholar of the creature of the creature, it must be a scholar of you; Because it is fell on that fate without what is more than it or decreases, and it must be the intention of the actor and his choice, and the intention is the one who does not know.This is the reason, and he wanted to find that in the man Or it decreases from it, otherwise it is necessary for the choice to be the one that is fateful in the fate without the increasing or the deficiency as a way to one of the one who is able to do so, and it is not possible for the one who is able to do so.It has proven that those who created something, then it is necessary and that it is a scholar with the truth of that creature and with his silence and how it is proven Our companions with this verse in Bayan that the servant is not found for his verbs from two voices: the first direction: they said: If the servant was found to be the verb of the world With its conquest, but it is not a scientist with its conquest, so it is not found for it, the bodies of the millions of two voices: the first: holding this.The second: that the fall of ten parts of the movement is a possible example and the fold of the uniforms of it and the deficiency of it is also possible, so the tenth of the tenth is made with the tenth It must be for the sake of the sake that the deceased Qadir is specially in rhythm, otherwise it would be fell without the uniforms and the deficiency of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the case Because the deceased charity, if that ten is specialized in rhythm, then it is imperative that it be a scholar that the fulle is ten, neither is nor a shortage nor a shortage, so it was proven that the servant was not He himself was a scholar of its conquest, and as for it, it is not a scholar with its conquest, so it is a man: one of it: that the speakers agreed on the authority of the wandering between the wandering And the domination for the sake of the breach of the dwellings, so the act of the slow movement has done in some of the bias a move, and in some of it, it is with it that it is not.He did a movement, and we are knocked.And the second: that the actor of a movement does not know the number of parts of those parties unless he knows the number of alignment that is between the principle The individual territories that can accommodate that distance from the first to the last of what it is?It is known that this is not known.And the third of it: that the sleeping and the oppressed may move from side to the side with that he does not know what is that movement or its inhabitants.And its elevation: that I have a father of Ali, and Abu Hashem, the actor only does a meaning that requires the arrival in the bias, then that the meaning that is not what is not made, It appeared in this sign that the servant is not found for his acts.The second face: In the congregation of this verse on the fact that the servant is not found to say: It is up to the Almighty when he mentioned that he is aware of the secret and what is in the authority of what is in the family, and he said: He who created and this words are connected to what was before him, even if he was an immortal, for all of what they do in secret and wicked, and in the breasts and hearts, then it is if it is not for it, and it is not for it.His saying: Does he not know whoever creates a necessity, as he is the highest scholar of that Things, and if it is, it is proven that it is the highest of what they do in the secret and the flower of the actions of the wounds and the actions of the hearts, (P-60), then it is said: Doesn't he know who created the bodies and the scientist who created the bodies is the scientist with these things?We said: It is not obligatory from his being, creative of other things, as it is a world of them; Because whoever is an actor of something does not have to be a scientist with something else, we are obligated to be from his being, as it is his being a scholar of it; Because the uncle of the thing must be a scholar of it.The second question: the verse that imitates three face His creation.And the second: to be (whoever creates) in the place of the monument and be the light guaranteed, and the appreciation is that God does not know who created, and the first is the first; Because the second indifference benefits the exalted as a scholar with the same one who is his creature, and it is not required as a scholar in the words of whom he is his creature, and the one who is not.And the third of it: to be (who) in the ability of what is as you are in the estimation of those in his saying: the sky and what it built (the sun: 5) and on this estimation of what is the one who is not (what is) Creation and what they make it and their guarantee in their breasts, and this requires that the acts of worship be created for God Almighty.As for his saying: He is the gentle expert, know that they were disagreed with (the gentle), and some of them said: What is the meaning of the world, and others said: Rather, what is meant is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The Keviyyah of its work is hidden from the most actors, and this is why it is said: God has forgotten his servants, and he is intended for him, and he is intended for his murmur, It was the remembrance of the expert after him.
