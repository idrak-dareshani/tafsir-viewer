The ninety -ninth ruling is the one who asks you about the people, say it is the time for people and Hajj, and the righteousness is not to come to the end of the day God may be successful, the Almighty saying: They ask you about the people, say it is the time of the people and the pilgrimage, and the righteousness is not to come to the people of the people, and it will be the same Al -Bayout is one of its chapters and fear God, so that you may be successful in the verse.Four tenth letters, and they answered.And I say: Eennery is in Surah Al -Qarra: The first: If my servants ask you about me, then I am a relative [Al -Baqarah: 186].And the second: This verse is then the remaining six after the cow surah, so the group is eighteenth of this surah.And the ninth: His exalted say in Suraida: They ask you what I have been allowed to them [Al -Ma’idah: 4].And the tenth: In the Wall of Anfal, they ask you about the enforcement [Al -Anfal: 1].And the fierce is twenty: in the children of Israel, and they ask you about the spirit [Al -Israa: 85].The second is ten: in the cave and ask you about the two centuries [Al -Kahf: 83].The third is ten: in Taha and they ask you about the mountains [Taha: 105].And the fourth is ten: In disputes, they ask you about the hour [Al -Nazi’at: 42].And for this question is a wondrous formation: two of them are in the first in the beginning of the principle: the first: his saying: And if my servants ask you about me [Al -Baqarah: 186] and this is a question about the self.The second: His saying ask you about the family, and this is a question about the characteristic of the creation and the rule in making the crescent on this face, and two of them in the hereafter in the last in the last: His saying: They ask you about the mountains [Taha: 105].The second: His saying: They ask you about the hour, which is its enlightenment [Al -Nazi’at: 42], and this is that this is a response in the Qur’an.The lobby is one of the surahs of the first half.The four of the second half is the first of it, the second, and the second is Taha, and the prophets are the prophets, and the pilgrim was packed, then (O people), which is in the first half The principle, and he said, O people, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul [Women: 1], and (O people of the people) who is in the second half, you will be covered by the evil Fear your Lord, that the treasure of the hour is a great thing [Hajj: 1] So they will be in this Qur’an in this Qur’an, hidden secrets, and a folded wisdom that is not known.The second question: “It was narrated that Mu’az ibn Jabal and al -Ja`bah ibn Ghanem and each one of them were the supporters who said,“ Oh The Messenger (P-103) God: The crescent does not seem to be an accuracy like the plan, then it increases until it is filled One is like sun, so this verse was revealed, "and it is also narrated from Muaz that the Jews asked about the family.On the authority of anything they asked, but the answer is like a sign on the position of the question; The state of the people in the deficiency and the Ziyah changed, so the Qur’an and the news became the ones that the question was about this meaning.* * * * * When people see him, it is said to him: the crescent of two nights from the first month, then it is a moon after that, and the father of Al -Hathm said: The moon is called two nights of the first From the last of the month, then he is called a moon between that A verb like a redness because they were disturbed in the vigor, and they were done, so they were confused, so they were confused about the plural of the number of the number.* * * * * There are two issues: the first question: the times are the collection of the meeqaat in the sense of time, such as the date in the sense of the promise His Lord [Al -A'raf: 142] and Al -Hallal is the meeqaat of the month, and the positions of the burning of the pilgrimage; In it, if it was said: Was it?His saying: الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم ان الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم الم The Sunnah is a phrase of time, which has the time of the sun of the sun from the kingdom, with the movement of its movement that occurs from the difference of the movement of the ark until it returns to the time, until the time is to come to the time, until the time is to come back to the time.The people have interrupted that the point is the point of the rabidi, and it is the first of the pregnancy, and the month is a burden on the moon of the moon from the point of the point To return to that point, and when the most famous of the moon was placed with the sun, and its most famous of the sun is the Arab Crescent, with the moon in this After the numbers and the mologens are out of the dark The day with his night is a phrase for a point of a point in a moderate day of the day, a point of the horizon of the horizon, or a point from the circle The one who is able to do the day, then the stars, they fell on the appointment of the sequence of the half of the day, the beginning of the day, the day of the day, the day of the day, the day of the day, They made the prevailing of the days of the nights from the parties of the sun, the horizon of the righteous and its return to it from the morning, and the one who believes in them is the one who gave them to the sun, as it is the same as the sun.After the numbers, then he made it first, so the day of the day is a phrase for the time of the sun, above the earth, and the night is a burden on the one who is the same The day of the first time (P-104) is opened by the dawn in the garment of prayer and fasting, and others are among the rulings, and when the stars are the time of the fast in the day of the day, it is the time An increase in the time of the night, the beginning of the beginning, and the hour is on two sections: a equal part of four and one of the twelve, and for a twelve Short in the year of the Sunnah, the month, the day and the hour.We say: As for the Sunnah, it is a light of the sun of the sun, so it is caused by the four chapters.The northern side, the air in the side of the north took something of the heat for its closeness from the head of the heads, and the frequency of the heat until it arrives at the first of the secrets, and the righteousness of the free As long as the lion and the lion were sealed by the name of the heads, and the frequency of the elderly, then it is reflected until the scales reach; Then the air is given to the air, then the freedom is taken in the deficiency and the cold in the increase, and the cold will increase until the sun arrives until the first of the grandfather, Because it is from the name of the heads, and the frequency of the cold, then the sun is taken in the difficulty to the side of the north, and as long as it is in the grandfather and the evidence, then the righteousness is more The bearing, then the air is good, and the sun returns, and the sun returned to the principle of its movement, and the time of the Sunnah has ended, and the chapters were completed, And the difference and the winter, and the fourth chapters and its punishment is a famous appearance in the books.As for the month, it is a expressive of the moon of the moon in its own king The luminous half is the thin half, so we do not see anything from its light, and when the righteousness is the light that is lost, we are facing us, so we do not With the fullness, the more the moon is close to the sun, the more it was The appearance is from his less luminous half, and the more he was the one who is more than his luminous half, then it is from the time of the time to the time of the separation, and the separation is from the time of the separation.The sun, and every night is seen more than the time to take advantage of the time of the meeting, and every night is close to the sun, so there is no crime, and it is not seen, and it is not the same.He says and says: Until he returned like the old people [Yass: 39], this is what the companions of the doctor and the stars said.As for those who say the origins, it is that the moon is a body, and all of them are equal in generosity, and equal matters in the divinity of the waters, and it is forbidden It is an adequate submission, so the crops of the light in the crime of sun and the moon is a permissible thing to get, and what was also the most promising of the presence of the existence The deceased, and everything that was a verb of a choice, is that it will be able to find it and its execution, and on this appreciation to the support of these sects in the rituals of the rituals of the rituals in Its approach and after the sun, but for us to obtain the light in the generosity of the sun, but it was due to the finding of the foolishness, as well as the one who is in the crime of the moon.* * * It remains for us to say the fictional actor, why did the moon allocate without the sun with these conflicts?So we say to the scholars of Islam in this place two answer: one of them: that it is said: The effectiveness of God is the Almighty, which cannot be found with the sake of the sake of it.He did a verb for a sake, for if you are able to obtain that wiseness, that is the middle of that mediator, then it is the verb of that medium, and it is not.And secondly: Everyone who did (P-105) is a verb of abuse, then if it provides that existence, he has the first one who does not have it, then it is deficient in the same way It was not a suppression.And the third of it: that if it was a verb with a metaphor, then that is the present, if it was an event, its events are limited to another exhibition, and if it is a valid, it is necessary for it It is referred, so there is no crime they said: Everything is made, and there is no cause of its manufacture, and it is not permissible to rely on its actions and its rulings of the bit: He does not ask what he does.The second answer: the saying of those who said: It is necessary to do the actions of God and his rulings from the sponsorship of reconciliation and wisdom, and those who say this are grateful, peace be upon the minds of the minds of the human being, On the authority of the prayer of the ruling of God Almighty in his kingdom and his kingdom, and we have indicated that the people were asked about the ruling in the disagreement of the moon of the moon.The ruling is in it, and it is his saying: Say it is the time for people and the pilgrimage, and this meaning is mentioned in another verse, and it is his saying: and it is destined for the homes so that you can learn the number of the years And the account [Yunus: 5], and he said in a third verse: So we have erased the verse of the night and made us the verse of the day in Basra, so that you can seek a preference from your Lord, and to know the numbers of the Sunnah: And the detail of the saying in which it is to be able to fate the time with the people in which the benefits of each other are connected to the religion and some of them with the religion, but what is connected from it, then it is from it.God Almighty: the month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed [Al -Baqarah: 185].And the second: the pilgrimage, God Almighty said: The pilgrimage is a well -known famous [Al -Baqarah: 197].And the third of it: the number of the deceased for her husband.And the sequence of it: the vows that are related to the categories, and the possibility of fasting in days that only know the people.As for what is connected to the world, it is like the lengths, the wages, and the dates, and the period of lambs and breastfeeding as he said: He carried it and his separation is thirty months [Al -Ahqaf: 15] It is easy to connect its and its duties, except when the conflict falls into the shape of the moon.If it is said: We do not surrender that we need to be able to appreciate the month of the month, and that is because it can be able to be able to do the Sunnah, which is the one who is a veil of the veil of the Likewise, it is said: I wrapped you with the slope of obedience in the first year, or in its sanctity, or its half, and as well as the parties of the parts, and it is possible to enroll it with the same.You have been charged with the slope obedience on the first day of the Sunnah and after five days from the first year, and also with the ability to assist on that there is no one that does not With the year and the day, its estimation is the moon, but the month is a light of a light from its meeting with the sun until it is gathered with it for the time of this time.The disagreement obtained in the most light of its light or did not get, not to see that the Sunnah of the Sunnah is ranked and if it does not get in the light of the sun, so that it is a disagreement.The sun is the moving of the moon, and if it does not get the light of the moon, it is disturbed, and if the light of the moon is not contrary to the case, and there is no effect in this section, it is not permissible.The answer to the first question: What you mentioned, even if it is possible, is that the count of the people is familiar with the statistics of the days; Because the people are twenty months, and many days, and it is known that the term of time is divided into the Sunnis, then every year is divided into the Shahr al -Shari Days, then divide each day to hours, then divide every hour to breath, I approach the firm and the most distant from the slander, and this is why he said: Twenty (P-106) months [Repentance: 36], and this is that the class is that the good deeds are observed.To the chapters, then each chapter to the books, so we are the answer to it.As for the second question: his answer is what you mentioned, except that when the moon was different formed, the knowledge of the two months and its half and its slopes was the most important of you, if it is not.And the majesty of his majesty was told that he had arranged the people of this strange manner for the benefits of his worshipers in their worldly world Glory be to him, the Almighty, and his ability, as he said: In the creation of the heavens, the earth, and the difference of the night and the day for the verses of the first people [Al -Imran: 190], and he said: Burj and made a bright moon and moon in it [Al -Furqan: 61], and also if he did not fall into the crime of the moon.The kingdom cannot be raised to change to its conditions, so it is its pursuit and the exalted, with its ruling, the murderous For the sake of the thorns of the sun, it is not only the fulfillment of God, and the moon is changed in its calamity, it is not only by the change of God, and the whole will become the same A wise man who is a wise, is a murmur, as he said: It is something that is not praised by his praise, but you do not understand their praise [Al -Israa: 44].If you know this sentence, then say: When it appears that the conflict in the conditions of the moon is great in the awareness of the facts of the flaws that he mentioned, the one who mentioned it, the one who mentioned it.I have been timids for people and the pilgrimage to all these benefits, because all of these things are destroyed by the sins, and the restriction of some without some Surprisingly, only the restriction remained on its meeqaat, so this restriction was indicative of the great eloquence.As for the saying of the Exalted: The pilgrimage is that it is an estimated and the pilgrimage, as it is the Almighty saying: And if you want to be subjected to you, you will be subjected to your children.That the people are a long -standing time, so the pilgrimage is the male, in which there must be often, and that good is said that it is that the verse of the pilgrimage is not known.Hope: The pilgrimage is a well -known famous [Al -Baqarah: 197], and that is because the time of fasting is only known to the family, the Almighty said: The month of Ramadan, which was revealed in it, said: [185] Peace: “Fasting to his vision and breakfast for his vision.The pilgrimage is defined by the most famous that God has appointed to his hypocrisy, and that the pilgrimage is not permissible from those famous to the most famous, as you were the Arab Know.* * * As for his saying Exalted: The righteousness is that you come to the beginning of its appearance, and it has anxes: the first question: they mentioned in the causes of the descent of this verse, and it is the one who said: The ignorance, if they are with something, then it is difficult for him to ask for it, and he did not enter his house from his door, but he will come from his successor, and he will be on this case, so that he is complete, so he is complete That is because they were doing it, and on this, the interpretation of the verse is not the righteousness that you come to the life of its appearance on the face He fears otherwise, and he did not fear anything that he would fly with him, but he relied on God Almighty and fear him alone, then he said: Fear God, may God bless you The world is like his saying: Whoever fears God will make him a way out and bless him from where he does not gain [divorce: 3] and whoever fears God makes him from (P-107) Calculation in the verse is that whoever returns a disappointed is said: What is the success of and what has succeeded, then it is permissible for the mortal to be the one who is mentioned in the verse is that the duty of you is to fear God The two successful people, and the news was narrated from the Prophet ﷺ forbidding the development, and he said: “There is no none or bird”, and he said: As he said, and that he was hating the bird and loved the good, the good, and God Almighty performed a people who fled with moses and whoever with him said: “He said:“ He said: “ 47].The second direction is due to the descent of this verse: It was narrated that at the beginning of Islam, if the man was forbidden from them, then if he was one of the people of the cities, we are nicknamed in the back of his house, He takes a ladder from which the surface of his house is shocked, then he is destroyed, and if he is one of the people of Al -Warr, he came out of the successor of the horse, so he said to them: It is not the righteousness of the righteous Whoever fears.The third face: The people of the ignorance, if one of them prohibits the nickname for his house or his cloud, is a nickname from him, he enters and brings only the senses, and they are the one who is a veil, and they are the one who is a veil, and they are the Qur’an.And Matham and the sons of Amir bin Sa`sa and the sons of Nasr ibn Muawiya, and these are the name of the senses to be tightened in their religion Their homes of the dirham and do not overwhelm the righteousness and do not eat the thickness and the most extreme, then “The Messenger of God ﷺ was forbidden and another man who was forbidden, and he entered the He was forbidden from the door of a two -year -old, and he saw him for that man who was forbidden, so he followed him, so he said to him, peace be upon him, and he said: He said: I entered the door and you are forbidden, and that man stands, and he said: I was satisfied with your Sunnah and your guidance, and I saw you entered, and I entered, and God has come to God.The verse, “And I teach them to tighten them in the matter of warning, not in righteousness, but the righteousness who fears the violation of God and commanded them to leave the year of the ignorant, and he said: Because of the descent of this verse.What we narrated in the causes of descent, except that this is the difficulty of the words in the verse of the verse, because the people asked the Messenger of God ﷺ about the ruling in the ruling in the ruling So God remembered the ruling in that, and it is his saying: Say it is the time of the people and the pilgrimage.Those who say this saying, they answered this question from the faces: one of them: that God is exalted when he mentioned that the wisdom in the disagreement of the conditions of the people made it the time of the people, and this is the time of the people.Which he expressed in the pilgrimage, there is no crime, God Almighty spoke to him.The family is because the two stories agreed at one time, so the verse was revealed in them with one time, and one of the two things arrived in the last.Classify the state of the family, and he said to them: Leave the question about this matter that does not mean you and go back to what the search for it is more important The matter is like that.And his interpretation is that the straight way is to infer the knowledgeable (P-108) the two thoughts, but it is inferred by the thought of the one who is the one who is the one And against the truth, and if you know this, then he said: It has been proven by the evidence that the scientist has a good, wise man, and I have proven that the wise does not do except the righteousness, but the righteous is the righteous, We knew that, and we know that the disagreement of the lunar of the moon in the light from its action is our knowledge that there is wisdom and reconciliation, and that is because our knowledge is not.The piece informs us that there is wisdom in it, because it is the knowledge of the information about the unknown, but it is inferred by the meaning of our knowledge of what is in it, for the sake of it, This is a falsehood, because it is a source of the unknown in the knowledge if you know this, so what is meant is from the saying of the Almighty: and the righteousness is that the righteousness is that the righteousness is that it is the righteous It means that when you did not know his wisdom in the choice of the light The thing is not from righteousness, nor from the mind of the mind, but the righteousness is that you come to the house from its doors, so you will be inferred by the mastery information, and it is the ruling of this, so it is the same.That there is a ruling on the language, and if you do not know it, then make the yoli from its appearance as a nomadic from the enemy from the ritual of the ritual, and from the rituals, and from the rituals, and from the rituals, and from the way of it.Holding the straight way, and this is a popular way in the kinna, because whoever guides others to the right face, he says to him: He wills from him, and he will come to him.He went to something from his door, he said: So we rejected him behind their appearance [Al -Imran: 187], and he said: And you took him behind you [Hood: 92], so when this was a way, this is a way.God Almighty mentioned here, and this is the interpretation of the speaking and the interpretation of this verse is not valid, for it is the interpretation of it with the first face of the ritual of the verse, It is a place for him.The third saying: In the interpretation of the verse, the father of a Muslim mentioned, that what is meant from this verse was what they knew from the human being God appointed him for him, and they will deprive the halal and solve the forbidden.The third question: His exalted saying: But the righteousness is the one who fears his estimation: but the righteousness is the righteousness of those who feared, then he said: but the sake of God: His report was presented.The following question: He read Hamza, Al -Kisa’i, and Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim, and they said about the benefit of “Al -Bayout” by breaking the Because because they were disturbed by the etc.On the basis of origin and readers in it and in it, it is like the homes, signs, and the pipes, the doctrine and the disturbances that reach its separation.As for his saying: Fear God, we have entered all the entry of all obligatory The dismissal: This indicates his will to the Almighty from all of them, because it is not specialized in the verse, and God knows best.
