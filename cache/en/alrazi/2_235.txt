The Quranic researcher is the fourth ruling in the speech of the women, and there is no wing to you, while you presented it with the speech You are secretly, except that you say a well -known saying: “There is no ward to you, as you presented it with the sermon You will remember them, but you will not be pleased with them, except that you say a known saying and in which there are issues: the first question: the exposure in the language against the one against the one, and it is that His words are what is reconciled to the significance of its integrity and reconciles the significance of its intention, except that its notification is in the manner It is his side, as if he dies around him and does not appear, and his counterpart to say the needy to the needy to him: I brought you to the peace of you, and I will look at you They said: The reason for your peace be upon me is sustained and the exposure may be called to be called; Because he is disobeying what he wants, and the difference between the kinna and the exposure is that the kiniyah is to remember the thing with the remembrance of its boundaries, as the saying: so -and -so.The ash, and the exposure is to remember words that bear your intention, and it is not possible for you to do so, except that your readers are affirming your pregnancy.As for the sermon, Al -Farah said: In his detection and Jahan: The first: that the speech is the matter and the affair, it is said: What is your speech?That is, what I saw, so he said: The speech of Fol and so -and -so, meaning: He asked her for an order and a matter of itself.The second: the origin of the speech from the speech that is the speech, it is said: the speech of the woman is a speech; Because he is a fan of the marriage of marriage, and a sermon; That is, he addressed the imprisonment and preacher, and the rhetoric: the great matter; Because he needs a great speech.* * * The second question: the women in the ruling of the sermon on three sections: one of them: whose speech is permissible to be exposed and permissible, and it is what is of the one who is free from the costume; Because when it is permissible to marry it in this case, how can it be permissible, but it will be excluded from it, one of which is a single image, and it is not narrated from the money of the money from the money ﷺ He said: ““ No one will be spent on the sermon of his brother ”, and then this hadith, and if it is rejected, it is divorced, but there are three conditions in it: the first case: if he is a rhetoric, then he will be a good.Here, it is not permissible for others to address it for this hadith.The second case: If the wounds of the fathers find about the answer, then it is permissible for others to address it.The third situation: If the wound is not the answer, nor the rest of the response, the advisor is that we say: one of them: that it is permissible (P-112) for the other one; Because silence is not It indicates contentment.The second: It is the validity and the saying of Malik: that silence, even if it does not indicate contentment, but it also does not indicate what it is fornia, so that the desire was made of some of the ritual The second rhetoric is a remarkable for that fate of desire.The second section: which is not permissible to engage it, neither a lament nor an illness, which is whether it is a disobedience to others; Because it was his speech to her, perhaps it became a reason to see the matter on her husband from where she knows that the suitor will know, then they may carry it from that The rights of the husband, and the reason for this is forbidden, as well as the return, as it is in the ruling of the consequences, with an indication that it is valid for its divorce, its validity, and its cursing, and the enemy of it, Witr.The third division: to be detailed in its right between the exposure and the permissibility, and it is the usual, other than the return, and it is also on three sections: the first division: the first division: The death, so it is permissible for its engagement to be anxious, not a permissible.The vote for her husband; Because this verse is a masculine of that verse, but it is not permissible to be permissible.With its disagreement, then the meaning is confirmed by that, which is that the permissibility does not need other than the marriage, so it is not believed that it will be carried by the marriage to the marriage of the people, With the disagreement of the exposure, it is not that, so that they do not call it to the lies.The second division: the one who is used from the three divorce, the Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, said in “the mother”: I do not like to be brought to his speech, and he said in “Al -Qadim” and “Al -Qadim” The marriage, so the accustomed from the death.The face of the prevention is that the one who is used to the death is believed in the causes of the betrayal of the enemy, for if its promise is to be broken by the most beautiful, the one who is the one who is the one who is the same, It does not believe in her horsemanship of its desire in this suitor, and how the betrayal is that it is informed of the elimination of its promise before it is permissible.The third division: the obese that is permissible for its marriage to its marriage in its enemy, which is the disturbing and the annulment of its marriage with the distress, curse, or insolvency For her husbands, exposure and permissibility; Because when he had his marriage in the enemy, the permissible is the first, and as not the husband, he does not doubt that it is not permissible for him to be permissible, and in the exposure: Its husband and divorced are three.The second, which is the most correct: it is not permissible because it is a usual that is permissible for the husband to marry her in her enemy, so it was not permissible to be brought to her as a reaction.* * * The question The third: Al -Shafi’i said: The exposure is a lot, and it is like his saying: the Lord of those who want you, or: who finds like that?Or: I am not a faith, and: if you analyze, realize me.And the boys of the interpreters reminded of the exposure: You are a beautiful and you are a favor, and you are a benefit, and it is my determination to marry, and I have a desire.As for his words, the Almighty: Or you are in yourself, know that the two: the hidden and the veil, the female said: The Arabs have nothing in the thing; That is, I set it up, two languages: it was it and its essence in the universe and in the soul with a meaning, and from it: what is their breasts (P-113) [Al-Qasas: 69] A people between them, and they said: I was the thing: if it was sought until it is not afflicted by a mouth, and if it is not hidden, it is said: a place of place, and a majesty, and a majesty, It is a reason for the burning, but I was, and I have been destroyed, and that is used in the thing that the human being hides and the one who has been disgraced, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same What is meant by the verse is that there is no embarrassment in the exposure of the woman in the number of death, nor in what the man hosts it from the desire in it.If it is said: The exposure to the speech is greater than that his heart tends to it and does not remember anything, so when the bound of the abandonment was presented with the sermon, it was the saying You are in your own neighboring clarification.We said: What is meant is not what you mentioned, but what is meant by it is that he permitted the exposure and forbids the permissibility at once, then he said: Or are you in the same and the meant This will be declared in the future, for the first verse is permissible to be overwhelmed immediately, and a prohibition of permissibility in the event That is after the time of the time of the enemy, then it is the highest of the face, which is for the sake of which permitted that, so he said: God knows that you will remember that you will remember She was harvested in the door of marriage, and that is hardly disgraced from determination and wishing, so when he was driven by this thought, like the hardship of the height of this, the exaltation of this is the same.* * * Then he said: But you do not have a secret and in it two questions: The first question: Where is the one who is left with the words of His Excellency: but you do not have a secret?Answer: It is a deletion of a way that you will remember them, his appreciation: God knows that you will remember them and remember them, but they do not.The second question: What is the meaning of the secret?The answer: that the secret is against the wilderness and the advertisement, so it is necessary for the secret to be the description of the dominance of anything For the meaning of it in the sense: and do not promise them to the thing that is described by the description of his ever, as for the first estimation - which is the first of the time The argument between the man and between the woman is on the face of the secret, does not disassemble the phenomenon of being diverted with anything from the ancients, and here are the arbitrators: the first: the first: the first: the first: the first: the first: the first: So the meaning is that the first verse is then to be inflicted on the speech, and the last verse is forbidden from exporting the speech.The second: to remove it with the remembrance of the gathering and the jurisprudence; Because the remembrance of that among the foreigners and the foreigners is not permissible, the Almighty said to the Prophets ﷺ ﷺ: Do not be subjected to the saying [the parties: 32] He is asking, who is in his heart.[Parties: 32].The third: Al -Hassan said: But you do not have a secret of adultery, the judge stabbed this face and said: The domesticated is forbidden by divorce, so he carried the words of the words The enemy is first.The answer: Al -Hassan narrated that the man enters the woman while he was subjected to marriage, and he says to her: Let me gather me, so if you complete your promise, I will see you.May God forbid that.The fourth: that this is forbidden for the man to walk the foreign woman; Because this inherits the types of rains in it.Fifth: To pledge it not to marry anyone.But if the secret is carried on us on the rumors, then it is in it, the first: the first: the secret: the intercourse, the commander of the Qais said: (p-114) ؎ that the secret does not testify and said: The secrets are only from its people ∗∗∗ and disagreed with what the passion is passionate, that is, whose passion for them is their passion, meaning that they are the vagists of the gathering.Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: What is meant does not describe his soul for it, and he says: The fourth and fifth will come to you.The second: that it is intended from the secret of marriage; That is because the slow is called a secret and the marriage is because of it, and the name of the thing is in the name of it because it is permissible.As for the saying of the Exalted: Except that you say a known saying, and it has a question, which is that it is the Almighty with anything that is related to this discretion.And his answer: It is up to the beginning of the first verse by abandonment, then he forbade the path with a payment of the Lord and the unseen, and he was brought up from it to be pleased with it.He prepares it in the secret of the charity to it and the fulfillment of its affairs and the sponsorship of its validity, until the remembrance of these beautiful things becomes affirming, and it is certain.* * His Excellency said: And do not intend to do the contract of marriage until the book is attained for its sake and know that God knows what is in yourself, so warn him and know that God knows that God knows best In the memorization of the determination: the first: that it is a phrase for the heart of the heart on a verb of verbs, he said: “If you are determined, then you will be reluctant to God.” [159] The determination is determined by the verb, so it is necessary in the verse of the act of verb, and this memorization is that it is prepared to the verb with a warrant “Ali”, and it is said: So, so is it determined.If this is proven, the estimation of the verse was: and do not intend to do the contract of marriage, Sibuyeh said: The deletion in these things is not measured, so do this The contract of marriage is to appreciate it until the book reaches its sake, and it is intended from the exaggeration in the forbidden from the marriage in the time of the enemy; For determination is presented to the intention to it, then if the forbidden is mentioned by the determination, then the forbidden will be sure of the assignment of it.The second saying: that the determination is a reflection of the positive, it is said: I have determined to you, that is: I answered you, and it is said: This is from the door of condolences, not from the chapter of the ritual, and he said: “A determination from the determination of our Lord”, and he said: “God loves to give his summary as he loves to give his condolences to his condolences.And in the first face, it is not permissible.If you know this, then we say: The positive is due to the existence of the existence, so it is not far from the memorial of the existence of the existence, and on this, then it is said: You achieve that and do not create it, and do not empty it until the book is notified of it, and this saying is the choice of the most achieved.(P-115) The lock, may God have mercy on him: Rather, he did not say: Do not intend to do the contract of marriage; Because the meaning: Do not be determined by the contract of marriage, that is: do not intend for them to complicate the marriage, as you say: I have to do so.As for the saying of the Almighty: the contract of marriage, I know that the origin of the contract is the tension, and the righteousness and the marriage are called the contracts; Because it is held as the rope is held.As for the saying of the Almighty: until the book is attained in the book in the book and Jahan: the first: what is meant by it: the written, and the meaning: the enemy is informed, The second: that the book itself is in the sense of imposition; As his saying: Fasting has been written for you [the cow: 183], so the meaning will be: until this is attained, the last of it is the last of it, but it is good for me, but it is good for me, With the words “written” because what is written falls in the souls that it has been proven and confirmed, and his saying: until it is an end, then it is imperative that it is beneficial to the ruggedness of the imam; Because it is the right of the end that was forbidden for the ban on the necessity of its removal.Then, he is the Almighty, the verse of the defense, and he said: Know that God knows what is in yourself, and warn him while he was alerting him to that he is up to what he was a scholar, and he was a scholar, The human being does it in secret and infection.Then he mentioned after the endowment, and he said: And know that God is a sweet forgiveness.
