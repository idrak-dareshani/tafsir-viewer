The Quranic researcher (P-3) (Surah Al-Baqara) is a civilian, except for the verse of 281, and it was revealed in the pilgrimage of the obedience and its verses are two hundred and six, and they are safe.The righteousness that the names of the warehouses are embedded, because the opposite is an example of a unique memory indicated by the medals of the meaning of it.The indication of the time appointed to that sense, and that meaning is the first letter of “beating”, so it has proven that it is names and because it is expressed in it with the end of the day College, funnels, descriptions, chain of transmission and addition, were not the case of names.If it was said that Abu Issa al -Tarmahi narrated on the authority of Abdullah ibn Masud, who said: The Messenger of God said: Its proverbs, I do not say the pain of the letters, but a thousand letters, a letters of letters, and a naughty mim.For the letters, and the release of the name of one of the two rituals on the other, a well -known metaphor.Farawah: The first: They sponsored this name for a gentle pity, which is that the names when they were the losers of their orders and they are free of charge, and the fasting A way to them turned to the name of the name, so they made the name the chest of each name of it except the thousand, so they are noticeable to the gossip that there is no place for it.The second: its ruling is not the same as the miracles of the miracle as the names of the numbers, so a thousand meat pains say, as it says one of the two three, then if it is the one, then the one is the one, then the one is As your saying: This is a thousand, and I wrote a thousand and I looked at a thousand, and so every name I baptized to the performance of its name, according to the reference The meaning, and the notes are indicative of the conditions of the meaning, so if I want to benefit the meaning of the meaning, it is necessary to notify the memorial from the movements.The third: This name is Arabized, but the silence of the names of the names, where it does not touch it, is an abstraction of the lack of its obligatory It was built by the followers of how and where and where, and it was not said that the end of the gathered noun in which there is between the two sins.The second question: for people in his words, the Almighty: the pain and what makes its sequences of the savings say: one of them: that this (P-4) is a well-known knowledge and a secret of the argument And he exalted him.And Abu Bakr Al -Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: For God in every secret book, and his secret in the Qur’an is the first.Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: Each book has a class, and this book is the virginity of argument.وقالَ بَعْضُ العارِفِينَ: العِلْمُ بِمَنزِلَةِ البَحْرِ, فَأُجْرِيَ مِنهُ وادٍ, ثُمَّ أُجْرِيَ مِنَ الوادِي نَهْرٌ, ثُمَّ أُجْرِيَ مِنَ النَّهْرِ جَدْوَلٌ, ثُمَّ أُجْرِيَ مِنَ الجَدْوَلِ ساقِيَةٌ, فَلَوْ أُجْرِيَ إلى الجَدْوَلِ ذَلِكَ الوادِي لَغَرَّقَهُ وأفْسَدَهُ, ولَوْ سالَ البَحْرُ إلى الوادِي لَأفْسَدَهُ, وهو المُرادُ مِن قَوْلِهِ Hope: It was descended from the sky with water, so it was shed by its destiny.The scholars, then the scholars were given to the public, a young man, on the destiny of their energy, and then the general public conducted my market to their families with the destiny of their energy.And on this, what was narrated in the news “for the scholars is a secret, and for the breach is a secret, and the prophets are a secret, and the angels have a secret, and for God after all of that On the secret of the scholars, they would have been disturbed, and if the scholars were brought up on the secret of the breathtaking, they would have their rejoicing, and if the creator would be brought up to the secret of the prophets, they would not be blessed, and they were not satisfied with them.The angels do not accuse them, even if the angels will be brought up to the secret of God, the Almighty is beyond, and they were brought up, and the reason is that the weakness is the weak, not the righteousness, as well The light of the sun does not take the sight of the fences, when the prophets increased in their minds, they were able to take the righteousness of the prophecy, and when the scholars have increased in their minds Introducing the secrets of what the public has fought about it, and so is the scholars of the inner - and they are the rulers - increased in their minds, so they appreciated the impersonation of what the knowledge of the knowledge of it.The people were asked about this forefather, and he said: The secret of God, so do not ask Him.And Abu Dhabian narrated from Ibn Abbas, who said: The scholars have been rewarded for their awareness.Al -Husayn ibn al -Fadl said: It is the similar.He knew that the speakers were denying this saying, and they said that it is not permissible to respond in the book of God to the exalted, what is not concept of creation, and begging for him.As for the verses, the four of them are one of them: one of them: His exaltation is: Do they not manage the Qur’an, or the hearts of their locks [Muhammad: 24] commanded them to manage in the Qur’an.How to command them to manage in it.And the second: His saying: Do they not manage the Qur’an, and if it was from God other than God, they found in it a lot of disagreement [Women: 82], so how do you command them?The negation of the contradiction and the contradiction with the fact that it is not concept of creation?.And the third of it: His saying: It is to download the Lord of the two worlds with which the faithful spirit has been revealed to your heart so that you can be from the two sides of the Arabic -Arab -to -name: 192-19 It is a concept of the hero of the Messenger of the Messenger ﷺ cautious about it, and also his saying: with an Arabic, an Arabic, indicated that it is a descending of the language of the Lord.It is a concept.And its lords: His saying: Perhaps his knowledge who delegate him from them and the tubes of it can only be able to surround By its meaning.Fifth: Its saying: a show of everything [Al -Nahl: 89] and its saying: What we have exaggerated in the book of something.And its sixth: its saying: a guidance for people [Al -Baqarah: 185], guidance for the righteous [Al -Baqarah: 2], and others are not guided.And the seven of it: its saying: a ruling in the language [the moon: 5] and its saying: a cure for what is in the breasts, a gift, and a mercy to the believers [Yunus: 57] and all of this is the rituals.And eighth: His saying: It is a light and a clear book from God.[Al -Ma’idah: 15].And the ninth: its saying: I did not stop them, as we have revealed to you the book, and it is upon them that there is a mercy and a male for the people who believe in: [51] Be a male with that it is not concept?.And I adore it: His Excellency said: This is a report for people, and they will warn him of it [Ibrahim: 52] so how can it be a report, and how (P-5) is the warning of it with it?And he said at the end of the verse: Let the first of the doors be reminded [Ibrahim: 52], but it would be so if it was known.Haddi is twenty: His saying: A proof of your Lord has come to you and we have brought to you a clear light [Women: 174] so how can be a proof and a light shown with it that it is not?.The second is twenty: His saying: Whoever follows my guidance, he does not mislead and does not leave, and whoever is exposed to my remembrance, then he has a life that is lost.However is known?.The third is the tenth: This Qur’an guides to the one who is the most loyal [Al -Israa: 9] so how can it be guided with it that it is not known?.The fourth is the same: His Exalted: The Messenger believed to his saying: He heard and obeyed us [Al -Baqarah: 285] and obedience can only be after the understanding, so it is necessary.As for the news: He said to him, peace be upon him: “I have left you if you are holding it with it, and you will not be misled by the book of God and my Sunnah.” So how are you?.And on the authority of Ali, may God be pleased with him, that he, peace be upon him, said: “He has to write God, in which there is a news of what is before you, and tell you what is after you, and the ruling of what is between you, is the one who is in you Mighty Mighty God, and whoever follows the guidance, otherwise, God is lost, and he is the rope of God, the dead, and the wise male and the righteous.العُلَماءُ, ولا يَخْلَقُ عَلى كَثْرَةِ الرَّدِّ, ولا تَنْقَضِي عَجائِبُهُ, مَن قالَ بِهِ صَدَقَ, ومَن حَكَمَ بِهِ عَدَلَ, ومَن خاصَمَ بِهِ فَلَجَ, ومَن دَعا إلَيْهِ هُدِيَ إلى صِراطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ.As for the mind, it is one of the faces: one of them: that if he had returned something that is not a way to know about it, it was the addressee with it That is how this.And the second: that the intended of the words of understanding, if he had not been understood, he would have been in the vast and fools, and that he was not hired by the wise.And the third: that Determination was signed by the Qur’an and what is not known, and the fall of the determination is permissible for it, so this is the whole of the words of the speakers, and they are invoked.أمّا الآيَةُ فَهو أنَّ المُتَشابِهَ مِنَ القُرْآنِ وأنَّهُ غَيْرُ مَعْلُومٍ, لِقَوْلِهِ تَعالى: وما يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إلّا اللَّهُ [آل عمران: 7] والوَقْفُ هَهُنا واجِبٌ لِوُجُوهٍ: أحَدُها: أنَّ His saying is the Almighty: And those who are established in the knowledge [Al -Imran: 7] If he was kind to his saying: Except God, they will not say that they believed in him, and for him to be broken from him It is useful, it is not said that it is a situation, because we say then that he will refer to everything that is presented, so it is necessary that God be the Almighty, saying that we believe in it for every one of us.And the second: that those who are established in knowledge, even if they were aware of his interpretation, would not have been to specialize in their faith in it By the arbitrator, there is no more praise.And the third of it: that it was followed by it, even if it was necessary to know that it was not required to be interpreted, but God Almighty has made it to God, and he said: Zagh, so you follow what is similar to it, abolishing the temptation and eliminating its interpretation [Al -Imran: 7].As for the news, it was narrated at the beginning of this question as a news that indicates our saying, and it was narrated that peace be upon him, he said: “From the knowledge of the one who does not know what is By God, if they have been subjected to it, the people of the deceased will be denied by God.Truly; For him, peace be upon him: “My companions are like the stars with any of them.As for the mind, it is that the actions that we have assigned to we are.From it we do not know the face of the rule in it on the sentence (P-6) with our minds: such as prayer, zakat and fasting; Prayer is incitement and a scourge for creativity, zakat is seeking to pay the needs of the poor, and fasting is seeking to break the desire.And among it is what we do not know the face of wisdom in it: as the verb of Hajj, then we do not know our minds and the face of wisdom in the throwing of the gestures and the pursuit of the righteousness, The investigators agreed that it is good from God, the Almighty, to command his worship with the first noms, as well as the matter of the matter of the second.Because obedience in the first type does not indicate the options of the leadership to enforce that the command is that it came to him when he recognized his mind from the face of the prayer in it.It indicates as a talisman of purity and the end of peace; Because when he did not know the face of the prayer of the dead, it was not only for him for the purpose of purity and peace.Also, the matter is like that in the sayings?It is that God commands us to come to us, to speak to us with what we stand on its meaning, and what we do not stand up The commander of the commander, but there is an other one in it, which is that if a person stands on the meaning and surrounded him, he will fall from the heart, and if he does not stand on the one The one who speaks to that is the rulings of the rules, for it remains his heart, forever, ever, and ever thinking about it, and the duties of the abandonment are the work of the work of the greatness of the day His words, so God Almighty does not know that in the meeting of the servant, the elderly people are satisfied with the one who is the one who is a great reconciliation, and it is a great way to you Crime for this reconciliation, this is the summary of the words of the two parties in this section.The second saying: The saying of those who claimed that what is meant is from these sacrifices is known, then they disagreed with it and mentioned its faces: the first: that it is the names of the light The speakers and the choices of the Khalil and his Sibuhi said: The cloth said: And the Arabs were named by this forefathers, things, so they called a blame and the father of Bin Lam For copper: a hunter, the criticism is an eye, and the clouds are Guyn, and they said: A rug of a rug, and they called the whale a nucleus.The second: It is the names of God Almighty, it was narrated on the authority of peace be upon him that he was saying: “O Kahis, O Ham, Asaq.” The third: that it is the hearts of the names of God Almighty, Said ibn Jabir said: His saying: (R, Ham, N) its entirety is the name of the Most Merciful, but we are not able to do so.The lord: It is the names of the Qur’an, and it is the saying of the dog and the Saddi.Fifth: Each one of them is indicative of a name of God Almighty and one of his attributes.Start, and the blame is indicated that it is nice, and the Mim is a sign that it is a glorious king of a generic, and he said in: Kahis is that it is a praise of God, the exalted on his soul, and the sufficient is sufficient, It is indicated by his being guided, and the eye is indicated by the world, and the one who indicates the sincere, and Ibn Jarir mentioned on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he carried the kaf on the authority of the old It is made, and the eye is on the dear and the justice.And the difference is between these two districts that it is in the first one of these letters of this forefathers with a certain name, and in the second is not like that.Sixth: Some of them indicate the names of the self, and some of them are on the names of the adjectives.Ibn Abbas said in (Al -M), I am God, I know, and in the sucking, I am God, I am pronounced, and in (Al -R) I am God, I see, and this is the narration of my father Salih and Saeed bin Jabir from him.The seven: Each one of them indicates the attributes of the verbs, so the thousands are its pears, the blame is its kindness, and the mim is its glorious.Muhammad ibn Kaab al -Qarashi said it, and Al -Rabi` ibn Anas said: There is no letter except in the remembrance of his mission and his blindness.The eighth: Some of it indicates the names of God, and some of them are indicated by the names of God, so the laughter said: A thousand from God, and the imam from Jabril, and the one who is from On the tongue of Jabriel to (P-7) Muhammad.The ninth: Every one of this forefathers indicates a verb of verbs, so the thousand is the one who is a thousand of God Muhammad, and he sent him a prophet, and the mother of any mother is the one who is the mother The disbelievers are angry and I have been confused.And some Sufi said: The thousand is meaningful, and the blame is with me, and the Mim is meaning from me.The tenth: What the mighty said and his choice is a great group of those who are achieved - that God is exalted, but he mentioned it in the infidels, and that is that the Messenger ﷺ is not that The Qur’an, or by ten lights, or with one wall, so they miraculously from it, these forests were revealed to him that the Qur’an is only from this It is upon her, and they are known to the phases of the eloquence, so it was obligatory to come up with the same as this Qur’an, so when you were rewarded for it, it is on the authority of God.Al -Haddi is ten: Abd al -Aziz said that God is exalted, but he mentioned it because in the ability, as if he was upset, he said: Hear it, if it is lost, if it is a response, if it is lost, if it is a response, if it is lost.You knew it before that, as the boys learn these forests first, then they learn the combinations.The second is ten: Ibn Ruwaq and Dartb said: The disbelievers, when they said: Do not hear for this Qur’an and abstaining in it, so that you may be overlooked and they will be overwhelmed by the symptoms.The exalted when I love from their goodness and benefit them to repeat what they do not know so that this is a reason for their silences and their recovery for what is from what he wants So God Almighty has revealed these letters, and if they listened to it, they said like a fanatic: they hear to what he brings to the praise of peace, so if they are, then they are, then they are, then they are.The Qur’an was because of their adherence to their integrity.The third is the same: the saying of my father Al -Ahaliya that every letter of it is in the period of elders, and the deadlines of others, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, said: The wine of the cow recites that book, then his brother Hayy ibn Akhbat and Kaab Bin Al -Asharf came, so they asked him about “pain” and they said: We seek God who is the one who does not The heavens?A man has indicated these forefathers by calculating the sentences that his nation is deadly And seventy years, and the Prophet laughed at you ﷺ He said, “Was this?He said: Yes, the sucking, so he said: This is more than the first one, this is a hundred and one of the years, so is this, he said: Yes (R), so he said: So we witness if you are honest, you have not owned your nation except two days and thirty and thirty years, so is this?He said: Yes, Hayy said: We are witnessing that I am among those who do not believe and do not know any of your sayings.And Abu Yasser said: As for me, I bear witness that our prophets have told us about the king of this nation and they did not show that it is how it would be, if it is Muhammad This is all for him, so the Jews stood up and said that all of us will be over to us, so we do not know the infection of the few.That is the saying of the Almighty: He is the one who brought you the book to you.”[Al -Amran: 7].Ibn Yahya ibn Thalab: If the Arabs are in kind, then it is for them to come to them, so that they will come with something other than the words that they want, and they will be forgotten.For those who add to the first words and release the new words.On the same one.The different, and the buildings of God's good and high attributes, and the origins of the words of the nations, with them, they are speaking and remembering God and reimbent Him, then he is the one who will be exalted, then he is the one.كانَ المُرادُ هو الكُلَّ, كَما تَقُولُ قَرَأْتُ (p-8)الحَمْدَ, وتُرِيدُ السُّورَةَ بِالكُلِّيَّةِ, فَكَأنَّهُ تَعالى قالَ: أُقْسِمُ بِهَذِهِ الحُرُوفِ إنَّ هَذا الكِتابَ هو ذَلِكَ الكِتابُ المُثْبَتُ في The elders are firm.With learning and benefiting, when the Messenger, peace be upon him, told him, from the previous one, he learned and benefited from that, that was a news about the absence.To be the first of what is heard from this surah, a miracle, indicating his sincerity.You say the introduction of the Qur’an, so he mentioned these forefathers, alerting him that his words are composed of this forefather, so he should not be a valid.Al -Mudardi: What is meant by “pain” is that it did not do that book, that is, we have come to you, and the Imam Al -Zayyar We descended from the visitor.Twenty: A thousand references to what is inevitable from the righteousness at the beginning of the matter, and it is the sponsorship of the law.The bending with the stimuli, and it is the pursuit of the way, God Almighty said: Those who are ready in us to guide them to our paths [Al -Anakbout: 69], and the Mim is a sign Love is like the city that is her end, her beginnings and her beginnings, her eyes, and that is, but he will be in God, and he is the Almighty, and he said, Say God, then they are their atmosphere in their mosquitoes.The twentieth: a thousand from the maximum throat, and it is the first of the wager, and the blame is one of the spears of the tongue, and it is the mediator of the exit, and the meme is from the lips, and it is the last of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not It must be the first remembrance of the servant, his mediator, and his last is only God Almighty, according to what he said: Explain to God [Dhiyatiyat: 50].And the choice for the most achieved from these statements that it is the names of the light, and the evidence for it is that these al -Kidsah are either that it is a concept, or a concept, or a concept, In the first place, for first, it is that it is permissible for that to be spoken with the Arabic with the language of Zanj, and the second is because it is the highest and described the Qur’an that is the same Ream.As for the second division, it is said: Either it is the intention of God, the Almighty, making it the names of the titles, or the names of the suffering, and the second is invalid; Because this is the most common in the language of the Arabs for this suffering, which is mentioned by the interpreters, so he can be able to carry it to it; Because the Qur’an has descended in the language of the Arabs, it is not permissible to carry it on what is not in the language of the Arabs; Because the interpreters are removed from the different faces, and the indication of this is the preservation of some of what they mentioned, the first of which is from the rest of it An excuse for consensus; Because every one of the interpreters, but he carried these al -Awsam on one of these suffering, and the one who has the same, and the one who carries it on it, or not for it, The rest, and when this division was prolonged, the judgment was that it is one of the names of the nicknames.If it is said: Why is it not permissible to say: This is the most knowledgeable, it is not known, saying: “If it is permissible for that, the word is done with the Arabic with the sake of the word.” that?And in his evangelism that God Almighty spoke to the suspicion and he is with the tongue of the dhillers, and the record and the discipline Farisian, his saying: اشْتِمالِ القُرْآنِ عَلى المُجْمَلاتِ والمُتَشابِهاتِ, فَإذا لَمْ يَقْدَحْ ذَلِكَ في كَوْنِهِ هُدًى وبَيانًا فَكَذا هَهُنا, سَلَّمْنا أنَّها مَفْهُومَةٌ, لَكِنَّ Your saying: “It is either that it is one of the names of the titles or from the names of the suffering.She spoke to her for another wisdom, such as what Qartib said that when they were put in the appearance (P-9), they would not be satisfied with the Qur’an, the command of God.With this rivalry in the appeal until they admire it at its hearing, and they will be silent, and then the Qur’an attacks them, so that it is that they are, peace be upon us Why is it permissible to say: It is one of the names of the suffering?Its saying: “It is in the language other than a bit of bit.” We said there is no conflict in that it is only a matter of something, but it is not that it is not.The special is a specific meaning?And his leadership from his faces: (one of them): He was upon him, peace be upon him, after the Qur’an, after another, and when he mentioned this forefathers, the Qur’an indicated from the case It is mentioned to say to them: This Qur’an is installed from these letters that you are able Likewise.(And the second): The pregnancy of these letters on the calculation of the sentence is habit of knowing when people.(And thirdly): This forever was when the words were established, it was a dear mourning, for God is the highest divided by it as it was divided into the brokers of things.(And its elevation): The confession is from the one name with a single letter from its letters, known to the Arabs, so God mentioned this forever.Peace be upon you, but it is opposed to its faces: (one of them): We found the many lights agreed in (Al -M) and (Ham), so the suspicion is in it, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the name of the name.If it is said: This is a large group that is named by Muhammad; The partner in it does not contradict the scientific.We said: Our saying (pain) does not benefit the meaning of the bit, and if we had made it a flag, there was no extension in it except for those who are aware and the removal of the suspicion, so if this is not the same He made it a flag, by the difference of name in Muhammad, because in the name in it, the other intentions of the other are only the one who is aware, and it is the blessing of it, and it is for it to be the name On a characteristic of honor, he is the purpose of intending the name with it for another presentation of these purposes except for those who are aware, with the difference of our saying: () The two years, if this is not exposed, then the name was nominated with a pure vastness.(And the second): If this was a name for the fence, it would not have to be known for the frequencies; Because this name is not on the two arguments of the Arabs, and the wondrous matters are the reasons for its transfer, not while it is not attached to its hide Flag, and if the reasons were expressed, then it would be known for the frequency and the dispute is used in it, so when the matter was not like that, it is not that it is that it is not that The light.(And the third): The Qur’an descended with the tongue of the Arabs, and they are not overlooked by what they were called by a group of two names, as long as it is raised, and it is not one of them, and there is no one of them Names, four and five, so the saying that it is the name of the light is the abandonment of the language of the Arabs, and that it is not permissible.(And its elevation): If it were the names of this light, it is obligatory to decide this light with it, not with the brooms of the names, but it was known as the name of the name The cow and the surah of Amran.(Fifth): This is a whole in the surah and part of it, and the part of the thing is presented to the thing with the arrangement, and the name of the thing is delayed from the thing, We made it a name for the wall of the progress and delay with it, and it is referred, because it was said: the group of our saying: In the name of some of his paradoxes, it is not permissible for some paradoxes to be the same as the installation of that compound?We said: The difference is back; Because the compound is delayed from the individual, and the name is delayed from the name, and if he had made us the commission a name for the one who is not necessary, it is not necessary That is the one who is from two voices, and that is not an impermissible, but if we made the individual name a name for the ride, it is necessary for it to be a single person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is lying It is delayed, and that is refined.(And its sixth): If it was like that, it is not necessary for a surah from the might of the Qur’an from a name on this face, and it is known that it is not.(P-10) The answer: It is agreed like that in the two lines.The second: that the name of this name was not found first in the country of the Arabs, and when they knew it, they knew from it its names, so they spoke to that of the names, so that the name is, so the name is.His saying: “It was found that the beautiful in the book of God does not praise in his place with Bian.” Our saying: Every total is found in the book of God, the Almighty, in the mind, or in the mind, or in the mind, or in the mind, or in the mind, or in the mind, or in the mind, or in the mind, or in His two, and then he comes out of his universe, is not useful, but the Bayan is where the knowledge of God will not be known.And he said: “Why is it not permissible for the intended to be the remembrance of these people, their silence from the desire?” We said: If it is permissible to remember this reason for this abuse, it is permissible for the reminder of the path of these devices for the same as this syntax, and it is invalid.As for the man of the faces, which they mentioned, it was clear that our saying: “The pain” is not a place in the language of the Arabs to benefit those suffering, It is not permissible to seek it in it; Because the Qur’an was descended by the language of the Arabs, and because it is opposed, it is not the case of the memorizers on one another.Because if we opened this section, the gates of the interior of the interior and the bridges of these people were opened, and that is what is not to me.As for the answer to the first opposition: it is not far from the name of the many lights in one name Hidden.And on the second: that the name of the surah is with a specific memorial that is not from the great things, so it is not that it is not reported in the month to the limit of frequency.And on the third of the third: that the name is three names that are broken from the words of the Arabs if you are made one name on the way of “Hadarmat”, so it is not possible.That is permissible; Sibuyeh is a text on the permissibility of the name in the sentence, the house of poetry, and the name of a sect of the names of the feet of the downs.And on the authority of Al -Rabaa: that the title becomes more famous than the name, so we are here.And on the fifth: The name is a sign of an independent matter of itself from the same indication of its appointed time, and the name of the name is so For itself, if it is permissible for that, it is not permissible for it to be the part of the thing as a name for him.And on the authority of the sixth: that the name of the name is based on wisdom, and it is not far from the rule that the rule requires the name of the name for some of the light.On the authority of the truth: that he is the Almighty, he does what he does, so this is the end of the words in the victory of this way.And he knew that after this gold, which we supported the sayings that we have told, Qartib said: From the fact that the two participants said that some of them: Do not hear.In it, then if the Messenger of God ﷺ spoke at the beginning of this surah with this righteousness, what they understood from it, and the human being is free to what is forbidden, so they were to be forbidden to the Qur’an They think and manage in its capabilities and luxuries; It is hoping that he may have come as a word that is explained by that vague, and that problem is shown.That became a means until they became listed for the Qur’an and managed in its tastes and sectors.And that is confirmed by two things: one of them: that this forever is what came only in the lights of the light, and that is delusional that the presentation is what we mentioned.The second: that (P-11) the scholars said: The rule in the removal of the interlocutors is that the one who knows when the Qur’an has known the Qur’an, so it is a hope for the Qur’an in the Qur’an, and the Qur’an is hoped for in the Qur’an.Thinking about it on the hope that he may have found something that strengthens his saying and supports his gold, and he becomes a reason for his righteousness to the arbitrators of the ritual If it is permissible to remove the interlocutors that delusion delusion for the same as this exhibition, then it is permissible The removal of these letters that do not delude anything of error and misguidance for the same as this excess.The most in the door is to be said: If it is permissible for that, it is permissible for it to be spoken by the adultery with the Arab, and that he speaks to this for this, and this is in this way, and this is in this way.The Qur’an is guided and bay, but we say: Why is it not permissible to say: God is exalted, if he spoke to the Gannjiyyah with the Arab - and that was included in this So that it is permissible?And it realizes that the words are a verb from the verbs, and the preacher to it may be the benefit, and it may be otherwise, it is said: The empty of the reconciliation in the kidneys is not like that, and if you mean to it, the emptyness is from the benefit, so why did you say that this is the praise of the ruling, if it is in the ruling.The reconciliation is only this direction?As for describing the Qur’an with its guidance, this is a guidance, and this is not incompatible with what we said; Because if the abuse is what we mentioned, it was the most hein of the faces of Bayan and Huda, and God knows.(Wonderfulness on the saying that it is the names of the light): The first: This is the name of two warnings: one of them: the Arabs come in it, and it is either as a name, or a name, The numbers of the entire number of a paradise like meat, and a whisper; It is a budget for the acceptance of and Abel, and as for “tattoos”, it is, even if it is installed from three names, so it is like the cards, and it is from what is not spent, for the sake of the two people in it, and it is the same.And ritual.And the second: What does not come in the Arabization, we are like a stick, and the bitter, if you know this, then we say: As for the individual, it is in two readings: they are: the readers of those who read it, and the one who has read it The movement is enticed to be the monument with a guaranteed verb: I remember, but the incorporation did not accompany him to the abuse of the shower as it is as it is.Like him in Ham and Wesh, if he read it, and Al -Serafi narrated that some of them read, "Yassin" with the opening of the noun; And that the conquest will be a mass, and that is that it is destined to add the division of the division.To make her not an atrocity, and this is confirmed by what we have narrated from each other, “God Almighty has divided this forever.” And secondly: the readers of each other are fractured by fraction, and the reason for investigating the silence.As for the second division - which is what the Arabs do not come in - it is obligatory to be an argument, and it is meaning that it comes to the saying after we transfer it to the first one, as it is the first of the first.“Say for me from two times.” The second: that God Almighty is in this way, according to the descriptions of the feet of the glorified: four ten together, which are: the thousand, the blame, the m and the one, the one, the one, the one, the one.And the good, and the cinema, H, the endowment, and the noun, in nine and ten walls.The third: These are the uniforms, the different numbers came, so I responded, "P." And “Kahis” and “Ham Aseq” on a five -year -old, and the reason for it is that the sons of their words are on a letter and two letters to five rides, so so.(P-12) The Followers: Is this a sweetener of the Arabs or not?So we say: If we make it a name for the light, then we will be blessed.It makes it a name for the walls that did not imagine that it has a solution on its saying, as there is no place for the premature phrase and for the enemies.
