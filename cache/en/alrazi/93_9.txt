The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: As for the yatim, do not be more miserable and read, so do not pulle, that is, do not wear your face to it, and the meaning is that it is the same as what you do.As God has improved to you [Al -Qasas: 77] and from him, peace be upon him: It was narrated: that it came down when the Prophet shouted ﷺ on the son of Khadjah and from the hadith of Moses, peace be upon him, when he said: “I have what I have been not.When you were able to say to her, you said: You got tired of your soul and then you carried it, for this reason I made you and with me on the creation, so when it was done by the peace of the Prophet, the peace be upon him.With the goodness to the Yatim, and if this blame is with the crowd or the worshipers in the face, then how if he humiliates it or eats his money, on the authority of the Prophet, on the authority of the Prophet and the peace of the Prophet His blood fell on the palm of the Rahman, and he says: Whoever wears this is the time that I have seen the dust of the dust, whoever silences him, has paradise."
