The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: No, but you will not honor the orphan, and do not embrace the food That suspicion said: (All), and it is a deterrent to a person from that article.Rather, that is either on the authority of the Sunnis of the Sunnah.A hidden reconciliation that is not informed of it except that he is, so he expands the infidels, not to his honor, and he is excluded from the believer, not for his insults, then he is the one who has said: The suspicion, as if he said: Rather, they have a verb that is a evil of this saying, which is that God is exalted and honors them with the many money, so they do not perform what is obligatory in it, so he does not say: They are honored by the Yatim and in which there are questions: the first question: Abu Omar reads: (they are honored) and after it with the disgraceful of the underlined, and that is that it is not.It has a gender and a lot, and it is on the verge of the absence, "they are honored" and "they love" to him, and whoever reads with metaphor, then appreciates them: say to them, O Muhammad.The second question: A fighter said: The feet of Bin Muzamoun were in the wilderness of Umayyah Bin Bin Khawal, and he was depositing him from his right.And know that you leave the orphans on the faces: one of them: he left his righteousness, and the signal has a saying: and do not embrace the food of the poor.The second: He paid him from his constant right to him in the inheritance and eats his money, and the signal has the Almighty saying: and you eat the heritage ate.And the third: take his money from him and him to the signal by saying: You love the money with great love, that is, you take the money of the millions and you will be included in your money, and you will not say it to your money The poor said: A fighter said: Do not feed on holders, and the meaning do not command his food as his saying of the Almighty: He was not believed in God, the great of God, and the food of the greatness of God.And whoever reads and does not “embrace” you want to be inconvenient, and you will be deleted, and you will be rejected, and the meaning: “Some of you urge each other.As for his saying: You eat heritage, eating, in it, in the books: (P-157) The first question: They said: The origin of the heritage is an inheritance, and the vit is replaced by the waw of the waw And it was directed.The second question: Al -Laith said: The gathering is the uniform, and there is a dumper of dummy and a stagnant stone.I did not know what his mother is, that is, I ate it as a whole, so the meaning of the whole language in the collection is, and the interpretation is in his faces: one of them: the one said: And the interpreters say in his saying: Eat, no intensity, which is a solution, and it is not an interpretation, and its interpretation is that the pain is a source of the sake The actor, meaning: eating a mother, that is, as if they were tired of eating.That is, the inheritance of the orphans “Lamaa”, meaning that all of you will find it.And the second: that the money that remains from the dead is permissible, and some are suspicious, and some are forbidden, so the heir is all, that is: the bit of one is in the past.And the third: The owner of the “scout” said: It is permissible for the sacrifice to be augmented to the heir who has spoken of money, easy, and it is not that it is raised in it.It is eaten by a large number of universal between the colors of the insults of the good, the drink and the fruits, as the heredits do the falsehood.As for the saying of the Exalted: You love money with great love, so know that the darling is the abundance.Any abundance, and the meaning: they love the money with great love, so he showed that their murmur on the world only and that they are as far as the last.
