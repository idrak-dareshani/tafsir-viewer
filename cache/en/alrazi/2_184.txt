The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: the days of the number of people, who are sick or on a travel, a number of days from other days, and on those who can be restricted by a ram of the food of the food It is better for him and to fast for you if you know.Know that in his words, the Human: Days of Many Issues: The first question: in the elaboration of "days" sayings; The first: Installing the custody, as if it was said: Fasting has been written on you in days, and his counterpart said: I intended the elderly the day of the Friday.The second: It is the saying of the female that it is not the same as its actor, as their saying: I have been given more money.The third: on interpretation.And the four: by adding, that is, they are fasting days.The second question: they disagreed in these days on two sayings: the first: that it is not Ramadan, and it is a saying of Mujah, and a giving, and he narrated it from the son It was said: Three days of every month, on the authority of a gift, and it was said: Three days of every month, and the fasting of Ashura, on the authority of Qutdah, and then they were lost, so he said: Then it was imposed, and it was said: Rather, it was obligatory, and these were agreed that it was bonded with Ramadan, and those who say that those who want these people are in this way: The first: What was narrated “on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that the fast of Ramadan has copied every fast”, so this indicated that before and the flood of Ramadan was another fast and a more and more.The second: It is the highest of the ruling of the sick and the traveler in this verse, then he mentioned their judgment as well in the verse that after this verse is the meaning The fasting is the fast of Ramadan, for that was a purely impartial and uninterrupted and that it is not permissible.The third: that his saying is high in this position: and those who are restricted by a ransom indicating that fasting is obligatory for release, meaning: if he wills, he wills The fast of Ramadan is that it is obligatory for those who fear, so it is necessary for these days to be the fast of these days other than the fast of Ramadan.The second saying: It is the choice of the most achieved, such as the son of Abbas and Al -Hassan and my father Muslim that those who are intended for these numbers are the numbers: the month of Ramadan said, First: Fasting has been written for you, and this is an innervated day and days and days, and then he explained it with the words of the Almighty: days of numbers, so some of the people are still With his saying: The month of Ramadan in which he was revealed (P-62) (the Qur’an) [Al-Baqarah: 185] So on this path, the days of the numbers can be made, That is not the face of his load on others and the copies of it in it; Because all of that is an increase that does not indicate that it is not permissible to say it.As for their first -to -touch them, peace be upon him: “The fast of Ramadan is copying every fast.” The answer is that it is not in the news that it was copied from it and its nation Each fasting, so it is not permissible for what is meant to be copied every fast and obligatory in the advanced bodies; Because it is valid for some of its laws to be a copyist for each, so it is correct that its law is a transcriber for its others.We greeted us that this news requires that the fast of Ramadan be copied with a fast that has been established on his law, but it is not permissible for him to be a people who have been to be fasting, so it is a time Where is we that what is meant by this verse is not the month of Ramadan.As for their second pilgrimage: that these days if they were the month of Ramadan, the ruling of the sick and the traveler was deceived.The answer: that in the appetite, the fasting of the month of Ramadan was not a specific duty, but the selection was fixed between him and between the ransom, so when it was like that, it was like that, and it was like that.It is permissible to think that the duty is upon him without the judiciary, and it is also permissible that there is no ransom on him, nor to make up for the sake of the one who is separated by the one who is separated by the one who is separated by the one who is separated from it That is, after the exalted, that the breakfast of the migrant and the satisfaction in the judgment is the difference of evaluation in the judgment of the resident, because they must be eliminated in a few days This is on the authority of the correct evaluation, and it was obligatory for the fast.The sick and the traveler will be in the house of the valuable resident from where the ruling of God changes in fasting, so he showed that the condition of the sick and the traveler in the ritual of the ritual in the ritual The judiciary is like it first, for this is the useful in returning the referee of the migrant and the sick, not because the numbers are only the month of Ramadan.As for their third pilgrimage: it is their saying the fast of these days and a good duty, and the fasting of the month of Ramadan is appointed and appointed.His answer is what we mentioned that the fasting of the month of Ramadan was a good duty, then it became appointed, so this is the report of this saying.And know that on both words, the copies must be made to this verse.The fast of Ramadan will be a good and a good obligation, and the verse that after it is indicated by the two years, so the second verse was a copy of the ruling of this verse, and it is the same His saying will be: Whoever has witnessed the month, let him fast it [Al -Baqarah: 185] people to release with his connection to the woven, and that is not valid.His answer: that communication in recitation does not have to contact the descent, and this is as the jurisprudence said in the number of died from it, its husband is that the presenter is in recitation Recently, and this is against what must be the state of the transcriber and the texts, and they said: That is in recitation, but in the landing, it was the most reluctant It is the old, and the verse indicated by four months and ten is the late, so it is true of its people, and we find in the Qur’an a verse in the absence The recitation of the civil verse and that is many.(P-63) * * * And secondly: Qalal, like his words, is the highest: a numbers of a number [Joseph: 20], and the origin of it is that the few money is estimated with number and is taken into account in the definition of its destiny, Winning and giving up, and the intended of this words, as if they were groaning, saying: I have mercy I did not do that, but I have mercy His saying: As it was written on those before you and the similarity is located between the two satisfactions from this face, and it is the relationship of fasting, and the fast is the one who is the fast.The two are in length and minors, and the intended is what we mentioned of his definition of the two days that the imposition of fasting on us and those before us was only a period of time, there is no time This was a bayna for being the Most High, the Most Merciful, with all nations, and facilitated the matter of the cost of all nations.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Whoever is from you is sick or on a travel, a number of other days, then what is meant by him is that the imposition of fasting in the days of the enemies, but the enemies are the same.As for those who were sick or a traveler, he has the delay of fasting from these days until last days, the locksmith said, may God have mercy His grace and mercy in this cost, and that he has shown at the beginning of the verse that this nation has this tox If the struggles are emerging, they are afraid.Then secondly: showing the face of wisdom in the positive of fasting, which is that it is due to the piety, and if the fast would not be supposed to the rituals of this?Then a third: He indicated that he is elaborate with numbers, so if he had ever made him or in the most leaked, the great hardships were obtained.Then he showed a lift: He specialized him from the epochs of the month in which the Qur’an was revealed to be the honor of the Shahur in the cause of this guidance.Then, fifth: removing the hardship in his commitment, so he permitted his delay to those who have been brought to him from the travelers and the satisfaction until they turn to the poverty and the skeptic The fast is this face from the mercy, so he has the praise for many blessings.His saying: (Other) in it the meaning of the condition and the penalty, that is, whoever is sick or a travel Not the past, as you say: Whoever comes to me.* * * The second question: The disease is a phrase of the sealing of all members of alive in the required state of the chest of his peace, peaceful, and they will be met with him.Praise to breaking the fast on three sayings: one of them: that any sickness was, and any traveling person, so he may take a download for his absolute memorial, and this is the least of this Al -Hasan and Ibn Sirin, narrated that they entered the son of Sirin in Ramadan while he was eating, so he took off with the pain of his sake.And the second: that this license is specialized in the satisfaction that was fasted in a hardship and an effort, and the traveling person who is like that, and this is the saying of the deaf, and this is the saying The absolute memorization is the most complete.And the third of it: It is the saying of the most of the jurisprudence: that the ugly disease of the breakfast is the one who leads to the harm of the soul or an increase in the cause, as there is no difference in the verb between the verb between the verb between the verb and what is from the verb between the verb between the verb He leads to what is afraid of him, such as the al -Muhmum, if he is afraid that if he fasted, his valves will be tired, and the owner of the eye is afraid if he fasts that he will be tired of his eyes, and they said: Significant with our knowledge that in the diseases there is what the fast is decreasing, (P-64), then what is meant by it is what affects fasting in its strength, then its effect in the matter of the matter, then it is not in the matter.Because this may get in a woman who is not a sickness as well, then it is obligatory in its effects of what we mentioned.* * * The third question: the origin of the travel from the revelation, and that is that it reveals the conditions of men and their morals, and the traveler of the denominator; Because it travels from the land, and the ambassador within two of the two of the righteousness; Because he reveals the deceased who was connected to them, and the past traveling; Because he has revealed and appeared, and from him the travel of morning, and the book of the book; Because he reveals from the suffering of his patience, and the woman travels on her face if the veil was revealed, Al -Azhari said: The migrant was named after the sake And its promotion to the territory of hypothesis, and the travel was called a travel; Because it is traveling from the faces of the migrants and their ethics, and it shows what was afraid of them, and the jurisprudence was different in the destiny of the traveler in the way of the ritual, so he said: Every travel, even if the travel was a firmness, and he held in it that the judgment was when it was stuck on his being a travel It narrates one news in the specialization of this general, but it is devoted to the general Qur’an with the news of one unable, and Al -Awsa’i said: The travel is the day.That is because less than this destiny may agree to the resident, and either The most is not a number of a number of a number, so he is obliged to limit the one, and the Shafi’i is gone that it is estimated at the same time.Three mothers with the miles of Hashem, the Messenger of the Messenger ﷺ, who is able to destroy the miles of the nose, every inclination is twelve thousand feet, which is four thousand of the rituals, so all three are three This is the money of Malik, Ahmad and Isaac, and Abu Hanifa and Al -Tuiri said: The license of the travel is not obtained except in three raids of four and twenty people.The first: His Excellency said: Whoever is from you is sick or on a traveler, a number of last days, it is required that the traveler takes me into a divorced woman, if the work is left, then the work is left with it, if the work is left with it, then the work is left with it One; Because the one who is tired of the one day is easy to bear it, but if the tiredness is disturbed in the two days, then it makes it hard to bear it, then it is appropriate for the summary.The second pilgrimage: From the news, which was narrated by Al -Shafi’i from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, that the Prophet ﷺ said: “O people Asfan, the people of the language said: Every person is four, so it is six ten years old.I shorten to the custom?He said: No.He said: To the time of the two backs?He said: No.But I limit the grandfather, the spoiler, and the sect, Malik said: Between Makkah, Jeddah, and Esfan, Four Rid, and the Hajj of Abi Hanifa: Whoever witnesses the month of you, let him fast it [Al -Baqarah: 185] It is necessary for the fast to our justice from him in three days of consensus on the authority of this destiny, and the least of it, and the least of it, So the fasting will remain.The second pilgrimage: From the news, which is the saying of peace be upon him: He wipes three days, and it is not like that until the period of travel is estimated three days; Because he, peace and blessings be upon him, made the travel the cause of wiping over the two hides three days and for the two days, and made this wiping the high and the highest.The answer to the first: that it is opposed to what we mentioned of the verse, so if they suggested that they are in the ways in worship (P-65), we would have made our side that we have been in the way Requesting the law, with the evidence of his saying, peace be upon him: Because the evidence indicates that the license of travel is required to the law is more special than the indicative indication of the spare of the sponsorship of the past.The answer to the second is that peace be upon him, he said: “The resident wipes the day and night.” And this does not indicate that the residence does not get the least of the day and night, because if he intended the residence in the position of residence an hour, it became a resident, so it is also the saying of the It is necessary for the travel not to get in the least three days.This is, but he said: Whoever is sick or on a travel.Because if the human being is in a house, if the residence is a place of residence, there was a travel, not a travel.He is attached to his intention and his choice, so he said: on a travel, it is based on the intention of the travel, and God knows his prestige.* * * * * * * * * A verb from the enemy, which is in the sense of the number, such as the mill, in the sense of the sacrifices, and from it it is said to the group of the number of people.(A promise) on denial and did not say, so that I did not say, that is, the enemy of the enemies.It is a number of its place, and it is noteworthy that it is not like that numbers, so I sing that is about the addition of the addition.And it is notified, but the raising is in the sense of it, so the fast of a number of people will be from the door of the addition of the added, and the addition of the “upon him”, so it is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the righteous, and the one who is the one who is the one who is forbidden.For the fast.Abbas and Ibn Omar, and Al -Khattabi quoted the flags of the download from Ibn Omar that he said: If he fasted in the travel, he would have spent in the presence, and this is the choice of David bin Ali More jurisprudence is that breakfast is a summary, for if he wants to break the fast, and if he wants to fast.It was estimated: to fast several days from the last days, and this is for the positive, and if we had read the lift, the estimation was: He did a number of days, and the words of Ali.It was proven that the phenomenon of the Qur’an requires the positive days of the fasting days, so it is obligatory to be the innocence of these days and a duty that he does not say.He returned after that verse, then he said: God wants you to the secret and does not want the hardship on you, [Al -Baqarah: 185] and it is necessary that this is the right They are their remembrance, and there is no choice except It is the ears of the sick and the traveler in the fungus, and there is no hardship except for them, they are two fasting, so his saying was: God wants you to the secret, and he does not want you From you breakfast, and the fasting does not want you, so that the report of our saying, and the news is two: (P-66) The first: His saying is upon him, peace be upon him: This news is and responded to a special reason, which was narrated, "He has to pray and peace be upon him, and he passed a man sitting under a parachute, and he asked about him, and he said: This is the one who said: “It is not from the righteousness of fasting in the travel” because we say: the lesson is in the general public, not with the privacy of the causes.The second: His saying, peace and blessings be upon him, said: As for the argument of the gambling: it is that in the verse in the verse; Because the estimation: it was breakfast for several days, and the arrival of this speech is that the guarantee in the words of God is permissible in the sentence, and the evidence of the evidence is upon us The permissibility, as it is in his words, is up to the Almighty: We said that the stars are stirred, and it was exploded, [Al -Baqarah: 60], and the estimation is fierce, and it was separated, and it is not the saying Your heads [Al -Baqarah: 196] to his saying: Or with him, from his head, foolishness, [Al -Baqarah: 96], meaning that he did a ransom, and he has proven that the guarantee is that Its fall in his decree is a face: the first: Al -Qafal said: His exaltation said: Whoever witnesses the month of you, let him fast [Al -Baqarah: 185] This is weak and his two sides: The first: If we do not appear, his words are upset: He who has witnessed from you the month, let him fast on the general, then we will be in the same One of you is the month, so let him fast, and he has shown us in the origins of jurisprudence that when the opposition was made between the specialization and between the guarantee, the specialization was carried.The second is that the appearance of his words is the Almighty: (let him fast) requires the garment in the eyes, then this must be fulfilled in the right of the sick and the traveler, so this is the right On all of the ability, whether we have said it is a number of days from other days, or we did not do that, and if this is like that, it is like that.It appears to be unaware.The second face: What the one mentioned in the book of Al -Bassit, so he said: The judiciary is obligated by breakfast, not with the disease and the travel, so when God is obligated to judge, and the judiciary is not, and the judiciary is not.It must be made of breakfast, and this is in the end of the strokes; Because God Almighty did not say: He should spend what he went on, but he said: He has a fast for him a number of days of last days, and the positive of fasting is upon him in the days Breakfast.The third face: What was narrated On the authority of his father, on the authority of Aisha, “The Hamza of the Muslim asked the Prophet ﷺ and he said: O Messenger of God, do I fast on the travel?” He said - upon him the prayer and peace: And it is a saying to say: This requires the copying of the Qur’an with the news of the one; Because the phenomenon of the Qur’an requires the fast of the fasting days, then this news is raised, unable to, if the weakness of these faces is proven, so the one is in the way His Excellency said after this verse: and that you fast the best for you, and the direction of the expiration will come if God wills.* * * The eighth question: for those who say that the fast is pervisible, Pharaoh: the first height: they disagreed that the fast is better than the mother of the pharmacy?And Anas ibn Malik and Uthman ibn Abi Awaf said: The fasting is better, and it is the gold of the Shafi’i and Abu Hanifa, Malik, Al -Tuari, and Abu Yusuf and Muhammad, and he said.Future, and for him the son of the son of the Lord, the people, the Al -Awazi, the Ahmad, and the Isaac, and a third group said: (P-67) The first pilgrimage: His Exalted Exalted: Whoever has witnessed the month of you, let him fast [Al-Baqarah: 185] and his saying is the Almighty: And to fast the best for you.The pilgrimage of the second team: that the shortness in the prayer is better, so the breakfast should be better.The answer is that one of our companions is the one who said: the perpetrator is better; However, it is weak, and the difference is from two sides: one of them: that the dhimma remains busy by spending the fast without prayer if he limits it.The second: that the virtue of the time is missed by the breakfast and does not miss the palaces.The pilgrimage of the third division: the saying of the Almighty: God wants you to the secret and does not want the hardship on you [Al -Baqarah: 185], so this is required that if the fast is, if it is fasting, if it is the fast.Fair break.The second branch: that if it breaks, how does it spend?Ali and Ibn Umar and Al -Shaabi were gone on to be followed by a follower, and the rest said: The follow -up is desirable, even if it is permissible.The first pilgrimage and Jahan: The first: that the readers of Abi: “A number of followers.” The second: that the judiciary is the counterpart of performance, as the performance was followed, so the judiciary.The pilgrimage of the second team: that its saying: a number of days that are more denied in the context of the confusion, so that it is a matter of days of days on the number So the pursuit of follow -up is contrary to this blindness, and on the authority of Abu Ubaidah ibn al -Jarar that he said: God was not permitted for you in his veil, and he is in his vetire If you want to come, and if you want to separate, and God knows.It was narrated that “a man said to the Prophet ﷺ on days of Ramadan, I will reward me to spend her separate, and he said to him:“ I saw that if you were a debt, then they were a debt of the day.Was it rewarded?He said: Yes.He said: God has the right to pardon And he forgot.* * * Another ritual, and another on the weight of doing, and what was on the weight of I did, for it is either that it is used with "from" from "or with the thousand and the blame, it is said: Zaid is more than the one who is more than one To be said: Another man from more of more as she says: I am older than Omar, except that they deleted it.On him, and the thousand and the blame “from“ from ”when it is permissible to seek it with other thousand and the blame, it became another and another and the last one has become a ruling on the ruling of its principles; Because the thousand and the blame were used in it, then it was deleted.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: And on those who can be able to do it, they are in the following: And a bid “they are bound by him”, and among the people who said: This is narrated by Ibn Abbas and Said bin Jabir and Mujahid.Ibn Jinni said: As for the eye of the energy, it is like their saying: I have no energy for me, nor the rituals of me, and I have a reader (they are loyal to him) They shed it, that is, they cost it.* * * And the satisfaction may be from them who does not tolerate fasting, and from them who is the fasting.(P-68) As for the first section: God has mentioned his ruling in his saying: Whoever is sick or on a travel is several days.As for the second division: which is the traveler and the satisfaction that is the fasting of fasting, then the signal is by saying: And on those who can be restricted by a ransom, as if it is a matter The migrant has two states in one of them, it is obligatory to break the fast, and the judiciary has to be the case of the hard -working effort, even if it is fasting.The second: that it is a stabbing for the fast that is not burdened by it, then it will be a good one between fasting and among the breakfast with the ransom.The second saying: It is the saying of the most interpreter that what is meant is from his saying: and on those who are reserved by the validity of the validity; So, God blessed him, first between these two, then he copied that and the fast was obligated to him with a certainty.The third saying: that this verse was revealed in the right of Sheikh Al -Harram, they said: And its report on one of them is one of them: that the expansion is above the energy.The nine is a name for those who were able to do something on the face of the ease.They restrict it, and on those who are able to fast with the severity and hardship.The second face: in this report The anomalous reader, “and those who are restricting it”, “it is with it and those who smell it and all of it, and it is known that this is not valid except in the right of the right Disbrling from the hardship.If you know this, then say: Those who say this saying, they have gone on to two sayings: one of them: He is the saying of Al -Saddi: that he is the Sheikh of the ritual, so do not, so do not.It is narrated that a person was before his death breakfast and does not seek fasting and feeds for every day holding, and others said: It is the one who takes over the sheikh.Al -Hasan Al -Basri was asked about the bearer and the breastfeeding woman if they feared themselves and on their son, so he said: What is a disease that is more severe than the bears that breaks and spends.And know that they were gathered on the way that the sheikh is the generosity if he breaks the feud, but the male and female Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him: The ransom, and Abu Hanifa said: Do not answer.The argument of Al -Shafi’i is that his saying: And on those who are restricted by a ransom, the bearer and breastfeeding women will be taken over, and it is also an acute and a duty on the sheikh of the sheikh, and it is a little On them, and Abu Hanifa separated and said: The Sheikh Al -Harram cannot be affected by the judiciary, so there is no crime.The ransom of them was also a group between the two bonds, and it is not permissible because the judiciary is a substitute and the ransom is a substitute, so this is the separation of these sayings in the three sayings in the three sayings Hope: And on those who are restricting it.As for the first saying: It is the choice of the deafness, they have begun on his health from his face It can be borne, or what is meant by everything that is called a disease, or what is meant by it is what is in the middle of these two degrees, and the second division, and the second division, and the second division.Battle; Because the bodies have many, many, unjust, and all of it is a merit of it, so it is due to what is weak and the weakening, and the lineage is not.There is a sign in the memorial to the appointment of that arrangement with the fact that the intention of God is that of the path.The first section, and that is because it is stable, so the verse is carried on it, because it is not due to the perception of the verse.(P-69) If this is proven, then he says: The first verse indicates the positive of fasting, and it is his saying: It was written for you fasting days, and then there was no one, and then there was no matter.The excuses are on two sections: Some of them do not tolerate the fast in the first place, and among them is those who restrict it with the hardship and the severity.I want it to judge the second section.The second argument in the report of this saying: It is not said in the knowledge of the powerful Qadir, it is that this action can be narrated; Because this memorization is only used in the right of those who appreciate it with a beating of the hardship.The third pilgrimage: that on your sayings, the copy of the copy is not necessary in this verse and on our saying, it is not obligatory, and it is known that the copy is the same as the lesser, the more it is the first, then the one is the first It is not that it is not possible for it to be unable.The fourth pilgrimage: that those who say that this verse is a human beings who agreed on that its people are the verse of the martyrs of the month, and that is not permissible because it is the one who said that he said: God is the secret of you and does not want the hardship for you [Al -Baqarah: 185], and if the verse was a copyist, this would not have said: God wants you to the secret, and he does not want you to do so The position, because this estimation was the fast of fasting on the path of adaptation, and raised his duty on the way of elimination, so it was a lifting of the lifetime of the family, How can he be able to say: God wants you to the secret and does not want the hardship on you.And the judge, may God have mercy on him, took the corruption The one who is given to him, and he said the saying of the deaf.The answer is that we have indicated that what is meant is from the migrant and the one who is mentioned in the verse, which are the ones that cannot be the fast, and what is meant by the saying: And the sick person who can fast, so the seductive was a hall, and it was proven by what indicated that the saying that the deaf chosen is not a weak, but if it is weakened, and if it is a weak, then if it is a weak, and if it is a weak The rest of the last sayings, the most interpreter and the jurisprudence of the second saying, and his choice of the Shafi’i and he embarrassed the corruption of the third saying, which is the saying of the one who said: Harm, the bearer, and the breastfeeding woman said: If what was meant was the Sheikh Al -Harram, he would not have said at the end of the verse: and that you fast the best for you; Because he does not rest him, and a saying that he says: This is a preserved on the Sheikh of the ritual that is restricted by fasting, but it is difficult for him, and on this, there is no one who does not say, and he is not.This hardship was borne, and that is better for you.Whenever worship is more difficult, the more reward.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: a ransom of food, and it has two issues: the first question: a navigator and the son of Amir “Fadiya”, “Bakhir”.” “Massakin” as a whole, and the rest of the “cousin” is a “backward” food, but the first reader is in it with the sake of the two: food?So we say it in it.The same description that it is food, so this is a matter of adding the descriptions to the adjective, as their saying: the mosque of the college and the vulnerability of the shirt.And the second: The one said: The ransom is a name for the obligatory amount, and the food is a name that brings the ransom and others, so this addition is from the addition that is with the meaning of " And the conclusion of Hadid, and the meaning: a garment of a tingling, and a ring from a new, so we are the ability: a ransom of food, so the ransom was added to the food with the food that you are the one Food.(P-70) The second research: that in this reader, they gathered the poor because those who are asleep by a group, and each one of them is obligated to hold, and the second of the second is With the collaborators, they made what was after it and the same as the poor; Because the meaning is on every one for every day of poor food.The second question: the ransom in the sense of the part, which is a phrase of the existing al -Badil, which is based Al -Shafi’i is an extension.* * * The third question: The Jaba’i was transmitted with the words of the Almighty: and on those who are restricted by a ransom that the obedience is before the verb, and he said: Those who are pushed by a domesticated fast, and the ability has been proven on the fast if the fasting of fasting; Because he is obliged to him, but he is obligated to him if he is not fasting, so this indicates that the ability to fast is before the fast.If it was said: Why is it not permissible for the guerrilla to be a domesticity?We said to two people: One of them: that the ransom is not mentioned before, so how can the guerrilla return to it.The second: that the guerrilla is a male and the feminine is female, because it was said: this verse is human, so how can the recipient of it be permissible?We said: It was before it became a germ that indicated that the ability was seen before the verb, and the truths are not changed.As for the saying of the Exalted: Whoever is voluntary is better, it is better for him, and he has three faces: one of them: to feed the poor or more.The second: to feed the one poor, more than the duty.The third: Al -Zuhri said: Whoever fasts with the ransom is good for him.As for his saying: And to fast the best for you, in his faces: one of them: that this is a speech with those who can only be able You are the ones who are tired or the hardships, and you are the best for you from the ransom.The second: That this is a
