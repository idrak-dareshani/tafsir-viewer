The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And if they are said to them, they believe in what God has revealed, they said, “We believe in what was revealed to us and disbelieved from what is behind it, and it is the truth.Before you are believers, I know that this type is also from the openings of their actions: and if it is said to them, it means to it to the Juda: By general, they took this verse that the word “what” in the sense of the one who benefits the general person, said: Because God Almighty commanded them to believe in what they believe in what they believe in what they believe in what they are Some, they will be forgiven for that, and if not for the word “what” benefits the general, what is good for this defamation.It means the convergence and the books of the path of the prophet who came to the jurisdiction of the law of Moses, peace be upon him, and then God informed them of them that they will disbelieve in it.And he mentioned this story about them on the way to the defamation of them, and that is that it is not permissible for them to be said to them.That was the most unbearable and if the evidence indicated that it is a descending from God, and it is necessary to believe in it, so it was proven that faith in some of what God has revealed.As for the saying of the Exalted: It is the truth is true to what is with them, so it is like a sign of what is indicated by the duty of faith in Muhammad ﷺ, and his two people: the first: the first: The truth is that when the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ was established with the miracles that appeared to him, then he is upon him the prayer and peace be upon him, and that this Qur’an is from the Qur’an The costs of faith in it and faith in it and it is obligatory, not referral, and when this appears that faith in some of the prophets and some books with the infidels are with the disbelief and the one who is the one.The second: What is indicated by his saying: a charity for them and his reporting from two faces: The first: that Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, did not know, and he did not know.He brought the stories and stories in accordance with what is in the inhabitant, from the origin of the origin of our knowledge that he is peace and blessings be upon him, but it is beneficial from the revelation and the revelation.The second: The Qur’an refers to the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ So when God told him, he is a charity for the converge The Qur’an is a sincere of the murderous, but it is lied to it, and if you are the one who is divided into the prophecy of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and they have recognized the faith of the faith This side is the duty of faith in the Qur’an and the praise of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.* * * As for the saying of the Exalted: So you did not kill the Prophet of God before he has in his books: the first question: that he will be granted and exalted be shown on the authority With a contradictory, it is contradictory from other faces, and that is because the teeth indicated that the miracle is indicative of the honesty and indicated that whoever was honest in (p-170) He killed him as disbelief, and if the matter was like that, the pursuit of the killing of Zakaria and Jesus, peace be upon them, will be unbelievers, so you would have endured in that if you believe in you With the stream.The second question: This verse is indicative of the argument in religion from the forehead of the prophets, peace and blessings be upon them, and that the inconsistency of the contradiction on the characteristic is permissible.The third question: His saying: So you would not kill, even if it is a discourse, but it is what is meant by those who were presented from their predecessors, and it is indicated by it: They were not guided.And the second: that they did not lead to that.And the third: that it does not come before.As for what is intended for the past, it is a show that the village indicates it.If his saying was said: Safety is a speech for those who are guided by: and you would not kill the story of their ancestors, so how is the whole way between them?We said with it: that you are denying that you have come out of faith in what you have believed, as your ancestors came out by killing some of the prophets from faith in the rest.The following question: How can it be said: Why are you killing before and it is not permissible to say: I am a touch?And the answer is in it, saying: One of them is that that is permissible, as it was with the description of the righteousness, as you say to those who know it with what is wrong with it.??As if you said: This was not from you.God Almighty said: They followed what the devils recited [Al -Baqarah: 102] and he did not say what followed because he wanted from her recitation.The second: As if he said: Why did you not accept the killing of the prophet before if you believed in the convergence?And God knows.
