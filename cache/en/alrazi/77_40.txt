The Quranic researcher (P-248) is the saying of the Almighty: This is the day of the chapter.The types of guidance of the disbelievers, and this section is a matter of torture by the brilliance and disgrace.Holding: One of them: What is between the servant and the Lord, and in this section everything that relates to the Lord, there is no need in it to the chapter, which is related to the reward of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Likewise, in punishment, it needs the chapter while it is attached to the servant of the servant, and it is that their works that they do until they are approved.And the second section: What is between worshipers with each other with some; If this claims that he has been wronged and that he claims that he kills me, for we must have no chapter.And his saying: We gathered you and the first are clear words for his saying: This is the day of chapter; Because when this day was the day, all of the costs are separated, so all the costs must be brought in, not even when the one who does not have the right to the judiciary, he said: You had a good, so they would not indicate that they were defending the rights of themselves with the harm of the trick and the good, so he said: “If you do not.” The de facto actions of the good, the deception, the deception, and the dress, so do, and this is like his words of exalted: So they brought a wall of the like [Al -Baqarah: 23] and then they know that they know Cut, and the cliches are not possible.The soul of the spiritual torment, for this is his obstacle: And the day of the day for the lies.His Excellency said: Those who are righteous in shadows, eyes, and fruits are what they desire, and they will be pleased with what you were doing.For the lies, I know that this is the eighth type of types of guidance of the infidels and their torture; That is because the most severe and the great blows were in the world, saying between the disbelievers and the believers, so that the alienation is from the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the disbelief that was The believer has a state and a power, so when God has revealed to this surah, the meeting of the types of torment, the treacherous, and the dependence on the infidels, explained in this one of the types And the dignity in the right of the believer, until the infidel is if he sees itself in the end of humiliation, humiliation, shame and loss, and seeing his characteristic in the end of glory, dignity, and raising His escape and his dignity and their domination, and this is also from the soul of the spiritual torment, so this is what he said in this verse: and the day of the day For the lies.In the verse: The first question: a fighter and the dog said: What is meant by his saying is that the righteous who fear the blessing of God.And I say: This is the saying of me is the correct one who is not adjacent to it, and it is indicated by his faces: one of them: that the one who is excluded from the evil is true to him; Because the one who is excluded from the polytheism is a compound from two chains: one of them: it is righteous.And the second: the privacy of its universe from the evil, and when the rolling is found, then every one of its individuals was found, not a referral, so it was proven that everyone who believed it The polytheism, it is true that it is righteous, the most exclusive in the door is to say: This verse is on this estimation, and everyone who was fearful for any thing is not, but it is nothing.Likewise, he does not praise what we said; Because he specialized everyone who was not excluded from all kinds of infidels, so he will be prepared for Hajj; Because the scientist who entered the specialization remains a pilgrimage as he exceeded it.And the second: that (P-249) is this surah from the first to the end of it is a arrangement in the grace of the disbelievers on their disbelief and their fear of it, so this is what is wrong with it.Reminded of this syntax, otherwise the surah is disintegrated in its systems and its formation, and the systems but it remains, even if this promise was for the sake of the believer; Because when he came and the holiday of the infidel is due to his disbelief, that must be counted by the promise of the believer in the cause With him and the dimension of the believer by obedience to his obedience.Partners and infidels.And the third: that the bearing of the memorizer on the full name is first, and the completion of the types of piety is piety from the disbelief and the evil, so the lord was carried on it.The second question: It is up to the disbelievers of the unbelievers to a shadow of three peoples who are considered to be in his interview for the believers three types of grace: the one who said: the first: Shadow and eyes as if it was said: their shadows were not shadow, and it was not singer about fading and thirst, but those who are righteous are shadow, and there are an eye for them.The thirst and a barrier between them and between the fading, and with them the fruits that they desire and wish for it, and when he said to the atonement: They went to the shadow of three who said: And they are happy, so that this is the permission of God, not by mediation, and what is its greatest!Or from the angels on the face of the generosity.And the meaning of “here”, that is, the pure of the pleasure, is not made by a luminous and does not fabricate.The third question: The scholars differed that his saying: Eat and drink an or permission.Abu Hashem said: It is an order, and God wanted them the most And drink; Because their pleasure is glorified with that, and if they know that God wanted him from them a reward for their work, then their abundance and their greatness increases with that, so that he wants to do so.Abu Ali said: That is not an issue, but he wants to say it on the face of the honor; Because the matter and the forbidden, it is they obtained in the time of the cost, and this is not the next characteristic of the other.The following question: Holds those who said: The work requires the reward in its saying: What you were doing and this is weak; Because the B is for the addition, and when God has made this work as a mark for this reward, the two of that work was like the work of the connection to the acquisition of that reward.And he said: We are also the best of the beneficiaries that the disbelievers remember what they missed from the great blessings, so that they know that if they were from the one who was the one who was the one To win the same as these goods, and if they did not do that, there is no crime, and they fell as soon as they fell in it.
