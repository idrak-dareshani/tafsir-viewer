The researcher of the Quran, his two, was the one who has two questions in it: The first question: the eloquent Arabic words that the custodian is delayed, which is not the one who is not.He was presented, and the text of his Sibuye has been in his book, so what is with him and he responded to the most correct words?The answer: This is the way to the exile of the reward for the same God, and the memorial is indicative of this meaning is this custody, and the oldest is the first, for this is this It is due to the subordination.The second question: How to read in this verse?Answer: Reading: (Kaafu) by the guarantee of the cave and the fulfillment and the sacrifice of the kaf and its brokenness with the beshes of the fulfillment, and the origin is the annexation and then reduce the like, the grace, the grace of the Ubaidah: Kafu, efficiency, and efficiency are said in one meaning, which is the ideal, and for those who are interpreters in it, there are people: one of them: He said as a game and a gift: there is no one, and there is no one for him.The reward in the part is because it gives it what it is given.And the second: Mujahid said: He did not have a friend as if he had grabbed him and said: He was not one of the sufficiency of him, and he would be able to do it.And among the paradise is a lineage [Al -Saffat: 158], then this verse is like this verse, as it is for sure of the Almighty saying: He did not give birth.And the third of it: It is realization that it is the highest of what is clear that it is the description of it in the elimination of the wanders and the exile of the watchers from the one who said: So, then the surah was sealed by the fact that something of the struggles is forbidden to be equal to him in any of the attributes of majesty and greatness, but the existence is not equal to it.The requirements of his truth, because his truth is not subject to the same as it is where she is, and as for the jurisprudence of the truths, it is subject to the enemy, and the knowledge is not equal to it.Because his knowledge is not a harmful, nor a stalker, nor a benefit from sense, nor from vision, and it is not in the exposure of mistake and zalal and the sciences of the juveniles, and the jurisprudence is not.In it, as well as mercy, generosity, justice, and virtue, and goodness, and know that (P-170) this surah is four verses, and in its formation there are types of al-Fawid: the one who is the first: On the authority of his two, he is one of his rituals, and the poison is that he is a merciful generous; Because he does not stand up to him until he is good, and he did not give birth, and he was not born on the fact that he is rich in divorce, and he is distinguished from the changes, so he does not have a goodness, and he does not For the sake of the righteousness of the benefit or the payment of a harmful, but by the custody of the charity, and its saying: and it did not have one point of reference to the negation of what is not permissible.The second one: God denied the same as the types of many with his saying: (one) and denied the deficiency and the seduction of the memorial of the fast, and the exile of al -Mualla and al -Ma’li and al -Mualla and al -Mualla and al -Mualla and al -Mualla He is born, and he denied the dads and the fold by his saying: He did not have one hand.The third one: its saying: (one) is invalidated by the ghosts of the one who said the light and the darkness, the Christians in the triangle, and the Sabeans in the fabrics, the righteous, the righteous, and the righteousness, You are going to go away from those who have proven to be an empty, only God; Because if he found another creator, the truth would not be desperate to him in the request of all needs, and the third is invalidated The angels are the daughters of God, and the righteous verse invalidates the involvement of the partners, where they made the idols enough for him and partners.The luxurious one: that this surah is in the right of God, like the wall of the caravan, in the right of the Messenger, but the stabbing in the right of the Messenger was that they have said: And the stabbing is because they have proven to God as a son, and that is because the birth of the child in the right of the human being is a defect, and the boy is present in the truth You are melted from me, and in Surah: We gave you that I say that words until I am a melody from you, and God bless him and know.* * * (P-171) (Advance).In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful.Before the perception in interpretation, it is necessary for two chapters: the first chapter: I heard some of those who know, so these two surahs were pleased with the one who said: Glory be to him when he explained the divine matter in the surah of the salvation.The darkness of the numbers is not ethnic, and the truth is its grace that has met those darkness with the light of formation, creation and creativity, so this is what he said: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Lord, then he said: And the face in it is that the world of the places are on two sections; The world of the matter and the world of creation on what he said: He has no creation and the matter [Al -A'raf: 54].And the world of the matter is all curtains that are innocent about the evils and pests, but the world of creation is the world of bodies and bodys, so evil is only in it, but rather the world of the world With the world of creation, because the creation is the estimation, and the estimated from the aspects of the body, so when the matter was like that, there is no crime he said: I seek refuge in the Lord who has gathered the darkness Creativity is one of the evils located in the world of creation, which is the world of bodies and gestures, then from the phenomenon that the bodies are either archaeological or support and the archaeological bodies are good.Because it is innocent of the selection and the polemics, according to what he said: What you see in the creation of the Most Merciful from the recession is the reference of the eyesight.Or a life, as for camels, it is free from all the Nafiite powers, so the darkness is pure in it And the lights of it in the kidneys are eminent, and it is what is meant by its saying: and from the evil of a soup if it is woven and the plant is the normal power of the plant is the one that increases the length of the long The vegetarianism is as if it is breathing in the three contracts.The world of the absence, and the preoccupation with the sanctity of the majesty of God, which is what is meant by his saying: And from the evil of envious if it is envied, then he did not remain from the signs after this The humanity, which is the one who is seeking, is not resumpered by it, so it is not the crime of cutting this surah and reminding it of the surah of the people, the paths of the rituals of the soul, That is because it is the origin of its innate, it is prepared for it to be discussed with the knowledge of God Almighty and its love, except that it is the first of the matter, without this It is one of the second paths in which the sciences are brought up in a priority, which can be connected to the informing of the intellectual unknown, and then in the last of that The power is to the verb, so the Almighty said: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the people [Al -Nas: 1] Referring to the first arrangement of the paths of the human soul, which is the case of its unknown from the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the science And the captain, and that because the soul is in that arrangement that needs an educator who raises it and adorns it with that of the beginnings, and then in the second soil, which is the second one, and it is the second of it, and it is the second of the second, and it is the second.The beginning of which is a king of resignation from it to the informing of the technical science Those of the technicians from the saying to the verb gets the perfection (P-172) to complete the breath, which is what is meant by his saying: God is the people [people: 3], as if the truth is called.Each of the paths of the human soul is what is appropriate for that path, and then he said: From the evil of obsessions, the piercing [Al -Nas: 4] and what is meant by the power of the rally, and the righteousness of the On the illusion that the mind and the illusion may help the gossip of some of the advances, then if the matter comes to the result, then the mind helps the nostalgia, And it is refrained from Tasilim Al -Nutjjah, for this reason, the illusion is called: with a bow, and then his grace showed that the harm of this cavity is a great one, and that it is a great person, On the authority of him, as if he had been shown in this surah, the abundance of human souls, and alerted its enemy, and alerted to what is in it, and it is the one who is between the mind, and there is the one who is between The traits of the patriotic soul The great book and the great difference is upon it.The second chapter: They mentioned in the reason for the descent of this surah and its faces: one of it: “It was narrated that Gabriel, peace be upon him, came Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the two Surat..And the second: that God Almighty revealed them to Him, so that they would be a tenderness from the eye, and on the authority of Said bin Al -Masib that Quraysh said: “Come on, so we can see it, so they will be lost, so they will see.” He came to him and said what is more supportive of you, and the strongest of your back and your face And the third of it: It is the saying of the philosophers of the interpreters, “Labid ibn Asem al -Yahoudi was the sacrifice of the Prophet ﷺ in one of the tenth of a decade and in and in the authority of the goodness of it.The Messenger of God ﷺ, and three nights were tired of that.By it, Jabriel said to the Prophet, a decade, and he read a verse, and he was verb, and whenever he read a verse, a contract was decayed, so he found some of the light.And he knew that the dismissal is that they denied that with their families, the judge said: This narration is false, and how can the saying can be valid, and God Almighty says: [Al -Ma’idah: 67] And he said: The magician does not succeed as it comes [Taha: 69], and because his vocabulary leads to praise in the prophecy; Because if it was true, it would have been necessary for them to pray to all the prophets and the righteous, and they are able to get the great king, and all of you, and all of you Because the infidels used to release him that he was enchanting, and if this fell, the infidels would be honest in that supplication, and the peace of God, and the peace be upon him.It is known that this is not permissible.The companions said: This story has been authenticated by the people of the transmission, and the male wages have preceded the speech on it in the wall of the cow: The Messenger, peace be upon him, is disturbed by being enchanting.His counseling: that the infidels were wanting to be an enchanted person, that he is a madman who has removed his mind with the medium of magic With a mother who finds it in his religion, then what is not denied by one, and in the sentence, God is the highest of what he was overwhelmed And his prophets, but in the harm in his body, it is not a distance, and the words of the words in this question may be presented in the cow surah and we return to the same.
