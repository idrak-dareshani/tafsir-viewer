The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Then you have measured your hearts after that, it is like a carpet or the most cruelty, and it is from the carpentry, as it is separated from it, and it is from it, and it is not from it, and it is not from it.From it, when it is lined with the fear of God, and what God does not do what you do.He was the origin of the origin of himself to accept the effect of something else, then he has shown for that capable of what is for his sake, so he did not accept the effect of the ritual, so he said: Right, cruel, so the body is where it is a body that accepts the effect of others, except that the thief of the stone is when it was presented to the body, the body of the stone has become the body of the abundance شَأْنِهِ أنْ يَتَأثَّرَ عَنْ مُطالَعَةِ الدَّلائِلِ والآياتِ والعِبَرِ, وتَأثُّرُهُ عِبارَةٌ عَنْ تَرْكِ التَّمَرُّدِ والعُتُوِّ والِاسْتِكْبارِ وإظْهارِ الطّاعَةِ والخُضُوعِ لِلَّهِ والخَوْفِ مِنَ اللَّهِ تَعالى, If the heart is shown to the heart, it is an exhibiting from this row, it becomes in the abundance of the affected by its young people with the stone, and it is said: the heart of the heart and the righteousness, and for that, as if it is the right In the way, he said: A second -ancient book, and the rituals of those who fear their Lord [Al -Zamer: 23].The second question: Al -Qafal said: It is permissible for those who address his saying: Your hearts are the people of the book who were in the time of Muhammad, that is, the one who is more After the sons that came to you (P-118) and the things that were running on them and the punishment that came down with those who were disobedient to disobedience from them and the verses that came to them and the signs of them came to them They took it on themselves and on everyone who condemned the victims of others, so I told that of their tyrants and their dryness with what is with them with the knowledge of the knowledge The hearts have the hearts, and this is the first because his saying is up to the Almighty: then your hearts have been harsh, a discourse, so he carried it on the attendees, and it is also impossible for you to be.Those who were in the time of peace be upon him, in particular, and it is permissible to want those before them from their predecessors.The third question: His Excellency said: After that, it is necessary that what is meant after what God has appeared is up to the life of that murderer, with the sake The slander is until the deadly appointed, for it was narrated that that deadly dead, when the killer appointed him, the killer attributed to the lie, and what was left of the denial, but he asked for the fatwa, When he said, he said, describing them: After the appearance of this verse, their hearts were measured, that is, their hearts became after the appearance of the same as this It is beeworthy that his saying is: After that, a sign of all of what God has prepared for the great blessings and the bright verses Which I appear on the hand of Moses, peace be upon him, because these are the Juda after that they were seen as their viewers for what they were free of stubbornness and the symptoms of peace be upon you and the peace be upon you.Their news in the end of those who look at it.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: or more cruel in which there are questions.The first question: the word “or“ for the murida and it does not fit the knowledge of the seizure, so it is imperative to be interpreted while it is faced: one of them: that it is in the sense of the waw as a matter Or increase [Al -Saffat: 147] in a sense and increase, and the words of the Almighty: they do not appear their adornment except for their fathers or their fathers [31] And as his saying: To eat from your homes or the homes of your fathers [Al -Nur: 61] Meaning and the sons of your fathers.And from his grooves, his saying is up to him: Perhaps he remembers or fears [Taha: 44], so the metabolism is an excuse or a vow [the messengers: 6].And secondly: He is upset, he wanted to inspire him on worshipers, so he said, as he says the woman to others: I ate a bread or a pass, and he does not doubt that he would not eat if he did not eat if he did not eat if one of them is that he did not eat if he does not want to eat one of them.To his friend.And the third: that the intended is like a carpentry, and it is what is or more cruel than the carpentry.And the one who is upset: that the Adamin, if they look at the conditions of their hearts, said: It is like a carpentry or it is more cruel than the carpentry, and it is intended in his saying: It is: That is, in your view and resignation.Fifthly: that the word “or“ in the sense of, but rather sought: ؎ God is what I know the Muslim woman, the mother of the people, or all of me, would have said: “He wanted, but he wanted.” And its sixth: that it is at the end of your saying that I eat only a solution or a bid, that is, my food does not come out of these, but rather hesitates them, and in the bottom of them: Rather, they denied them.And the sake of it: that “or“ a letter of permissibility, as if it was said that any of these was likened to their hearts was sincere as a saying: the sitting of goodness or the son of Sirin, that is, which is the one who is.They were sitting with you as well.The second question: The owner of the scout said: Its soul is more cruel.She accepted her as he said: If this Qur’an revealed to us on a mountain, he would have seen it, humbled from the fear of God [Al -Hasharah: 21].And secondly: that the carpentry does not have a disintegration of what is happening in it with the command of God Almighty, even if it is cruel, but rather is a disposary on the intention of God, and it is not forbidden.We have described them from their conditions in the connection of the verses with them, and the blessing of God is followed by God.For the knowledge of his right, and he is like his exalted saying: There is no bear in the land, nor a bird that flies with his two sides [Al -Anam: 38] to the saying of the high [Al -Awam: 39] As if the meaning is that the animals are not among the children of Adam, a nations that were shaken by each one of them for something and it is criticized for what I want from it, and these disbelievers are from them.And the third: or more cruel; Because the stones are used by some of the faces, and the water appears in some of the conditions, but the hearts of these are, we do not benefit from it, and it is not possible for the obedience to the obedience.The loyal question: The judge said: If the high is the creator in them, they are always on what they are from the disbelievers, so how can they do their vigilance with this way, and that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ritual of the ritual And they said to him: The one who created the crucifixion in the carpentry is the one who created in our hearts the cruelty, and the creator in the carpentry is the exaggeration of the rivers is the one who is able to transfer us from what we say to us.With the creation of faith in us, if it does not do, then we will be an excuse, then their pilgrimage was upon him, and he confirmed his Hajj on them.Pharaohs and phases.The fifth question: Rather, he said: It is more cruel and did not say harsh; Because that is evidenced by the excess of the cruelty, and another direction, which is not to mean the meaning of the harshest, but he intended and described the cruelty with the severity as if it was said: And their hearts are more cruel, and read “harsh”, and the guarantee of the preference is left upon him for the dress of the dress as your saying: a generous increase and Amr Akram.Then, it is their pursuit and the Almighty, and he preferred the carpentry over their hearts by showing that the carpentry may get three types of benefits from them, and there is no one in the hearts.So the first: His Excellency said: It is from the carpentry, as the ritualization is broken from it in it.It is obligatory for the separate lam, and it is the saying of the Almighty: If all, all of our religion are prepared [Jes: 32].The second question: the severity of the time and the many, it is said: it was exploded by the ulcers of so -and -so, that is, it was created by the duration and the dawn and the dawn.Malik bin Dinar read “exploding” in the sense, and from the carpentry, it is inhale, and it comes out of the water that runs until the rivers will be from it.The referee said: The rivers are generated by the brightness that will be gathered in the ground of the earth, if the appearance of the earth was a relaxed, then that is the most late, and that is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the latter, and it was A stars, the most late, and still connect to its ritualism until it is a lot of great much The earth is inhale and that water is loyal and flowering.And the second: His Excellency said: And from it, it is not stained, and the water comes out of it, that is, from the carpentry, it is not valid, and the water comes out of it, so it will be an eye, and there is no neighbor, that is, the river is a neighbor, meaning that it is a river, that is, that the stroke is the stagnation And in a little water, and in that the spiral of the wet reversal in it, and that it may multiply in a state until it comes out of what is left from the rivers, and it may be reduced, and these are the hearts of the It is not the acceptance of something of preaching and does not explain to that and do not turn to the guidance and his saying is up to the Almighty: He will be stalked [Al-Qarra: 269] That is, it is mentioned and its saying: O, the binding (P-120) [Al-Muzammal: 1], Oh, the developed [the influence: 1].And the third of it: His Exalted Him: It is of it that it is lined with the fear of God.And he knows that there is a problem that is that the stubbornness is from the fear of God, the thief of the minds, and the stone is gone, so this is not achieved in it, for this forms is mentioned in this The saying of my father is a special Muslim, which is that the bloodshed is in his saying: And that it is a return to the hearts, because it is not permissible for it to be rough, and the stagnation is not permissible for it, and it is permissible.The hearts as the male of the carpentry is presented, the maximum in the chapter is that the carpentry is close to the masculinity, except that this description is what was appropriate for the hearts without the stones, and this is the ritual.Without the carpentry, and they are exposed to it from two faces: the first: that his saying is up to the Almighty: it is like a carpentry or more severely cruelty From the carpentry, the rivers are separated from it, and it is obligatory to say it to the Almighty: and it is from it that it is bound from the fear of God to be a return to it.The second: that the dowry is performed with the stones, not the hearts, so the dowry will not be interpreted from the roughness.And the second: the saying of a group of the two interpreters: The destiny is a source of the carpentry, but we do not surrender that the carpentry is not a rational life, and that it is a reason that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is a reason Peace, when he cut off and spoil his Lord, and that is because God is glorified and the Almighty created in it life, mind and awareness, and this is not the same in the power of God The Almighty said: And they said to their hearts, why did you testify to us.So, the mountains were described with fear, and he also said: If this Qur’an was revealed to us on a mountain, it would have brought it to the fear of the fear of God, and the fear of God: He made the mind and understanding in it, as well as that, and it was narrated that the trunger of the sauids of the Messenger of God ﷺ Al -Mubbar, and narrated “on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he came to him.And the Prophet ﷺ dismissed to his house.And the trees, all of which were saying: Peace be upon you, O Messenger of God.And the dismissal denied this interpretation, because they have the structure and the mood is accustomed to the condition of the acceptance of life and the mind, and there is no significance for them to the church of the structure Relax, so it is not obligatory for them.This saying is a kind of interpretation: the first: that from the carpentry is what is mentioned in the high position in which he is in it and he will descend to the bottom and these are the disbelievers, the disbelief, As if the dowry of the high is made for example for the sales, and its saying: From the fear of God, that is, that is the despair, even if it was found from the sane person, for the sake of it As his saying: He found a grandfather in which he wants to arise and set up it [Al -Kahf: 77], that is, a grandfather, in which he appeared in the teeth and the approach of the strokes, what is the same Frequently, it was a pious to disappear, and the like is the saying of each other: a foolishness that is misled by his laboratory ∗∗∗ you see the cousin in it as a prostration of the rituals of the rituals: When the news of the ziber came, the wall of the city and the rushing mountains was made, so he made the first what appeared in the most effective from the effects of the boundaries with the same Like the prostration of it for the sewers, and the second: He made what appeared in the people of the city from the effects of the seedlings like the roughness.The seventh heavens praise for him, and those who are in them, and that there is nothing but praise with his praise [Al -Asra: 44], and his saying is up to God: And to God, what is in the heavens, and what is in the heavens [49] And the Almighty said: The stars and the tree are prostrating [Al -Rahman: 6].Some of him are from some, when the seminars are for the sake of what God wants with that of the fear of his servants to him and his fear of him with the supplication and the rituals.The original one of the rugs in the stray sequippes is that the fear of God will be exalted in the hearts of worshipers, that fear has become like the influential cause in the case of the word, so the From the exaltation of the end, he said: from the fear of God, that is, by the reason that the fear of God will be obtained in the hearts.The one who is lurking from the clouds is a fear of God, to his servants, to make them happy with him.Or what is required for God as it is said: The Qur’an descended with a prohibition such and such and such, that is, with the affirmation of that on the people.Because, even if he is accustomed to the descent, it is water in the truth, and because it does not fit that name.As for His Excellency: And God is unaware of what you do.And the hereafter, and he is like his words: What your Lord was forgotten [Mary: 64] and in this Eid to them and a great fear to be imprisoned.If it is said: Is it correct for God to describe that he is not a heedless?We said: The judge said: It is not valid because he is delusional to the disbelief on it, and the matter is not like that, because the denial of the adjective from the thing is not necessary.Its exaltation said: Do not take it for a year or sleep [Al -Baqara: 255] and it is feared and does not feed [Al -Anam: 14] and God knows.
