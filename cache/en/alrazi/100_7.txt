The Qur’an is one of it: His saying: The human being is for his Lord for the stomach.I am alerted, then for the interpreters, then Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ekrama, Al -Dhagak, and Qutdah said: The chants are the infidels, they said: And from the one who is the name of the man Because he was his father, and he separated him, and on the authority of the dogs -with the tongue of Kinda -: the sinner, and the tongue of the children of Malik: Al -Bakhil, and with a harmful person and the righteous: “The chants” is the infidelity that prevents his honor, and he eats alone, and his servant will be harmed.”Al -Hassan said: And the rest, and it is like his saying: As for if they are trapped, he is able to live upon him, so my Lord says insult It was not possible to carry it on all people, so it is necessary from his shift to a specific infidel, or if we carried it on all the meaning that the man of the human being is to carry it with it With his kindness and his success from that, and the first is the saying of the most of the two, they said: Because Ibn Abbas said: It was descended in Qatat ibn Abd al -Allah ibn Umar Al -Qarishi, and also he said: Do you not know if he is stung in what is in the graves, he only follows the infidels: because that is like a sign that it is a denial of this matter.The second: One of the things that God has been divided by saying: He is on that of a martyr and in which they say: One of them is that the human being is on that, that is: on the authority Suffering it with that, either because it is an apparent matter that cannot be unjust, or because it testifies to himself in the hereafter in the last, and he is known.The second saying: What is meant and that God is a martyr who said: This is the first because the guerrilla is returned to the closest male, and the closest here is the word of the Lord And the impression of him from the tinkers from where he is counted on his work, and the supporters of the first saying are, and they said: If he said after that: and that is: It is in it a hand to the human being, so the conscience must be in the verse that before it is domesticated to the human being, so that the organizer will be better.The third matter: From what God has divided upon him, his saying: It is the love of goodness to tighten the good money from his saying of the Almighty: if you leave it good [180] [Al -Ma’arj: 21] This is because people are preparing money in between them, as it is the highest that he called what the Mujahid attains from the wounds and the harm of war is bad in his saying: “No,” And the hard -minded pulled The mind of the thorns of the thorns, and then in the interpretation of the interpretation: is one of them: it is for the sake of the love of money to be hidden.And the second: that the intended is from the strong hardness, and the meaning is that it is for the love of money and the inferiority of the world and its demand is strong, and it is the love of the worship of God She says: He is a hardship for this matter and is strong for him, if he is firm.And the third: He wanted to love the treachery, as it is a simplicity, but it is a strong and arrogant.And its booster: Al -Farah said: It is permissible for the meaning to be the love of goodness to tighten love, meaning that he loves money, and loves his love for him, The second, as he said: The wind was worn on a clear day.Fifth: Qatarb said: That is, it is the hardship of the love of good, as you say that it is a belling, that is, it is a further stroke.
