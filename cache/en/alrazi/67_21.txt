The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: the security of this is the one who is a changer for you that will support you without the mercy.Know that the disbelievers used to refrain from faith, and do not fulfill the call of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and they were cooperating with them: one of them: one of them: They have their money and their soldiers.The second: that they were saying: This is the second one to us all the goods, and all the pests are deposited from us.And God has been overwhelmed by each of these two guys, but the first is to say it: the security of this is the one who is a soldier for you to support you from the day of the mercy of this His saying: The mother of you who believe in the sky (the king: 16), and the meaning is the one who refers to it from the group, and it is said: This is the one who is a changer for you, who will help you without God.The disbelievers are only in the vanity of any of the Satan, which deceives them that the torment does not descend from them.As for the second, it is his saying: The security of this who gives you your livelihood if he grabs his livelihood.The meaning: Whoever provides you with your gods, if God holds the sustenance of you, and this is also what is not denied by a mind, and this is that it is the highest of the ritual And otherwise, it is not found, and it was found, so this matter was clear.Requirement, arrogance, and alienation, that is, a devotion to the truth and symptoms of it, so the curse is due to their perseverance on the world, and it is a sign of the corruption of the power of power They are ignorant of, and this is a sign of the corruption of the theoretical power.And know that he was exalted when he described them with the affairs and al -Nafhar, he alerted what indicates the ugliness of these two descriptions; And the Almighty said: Whoever walks on the face of his face is a security that walks together on a straight path and in which there are questions: the first question: the one said: So he dwelt, and his counterpart raised the soup, so he raised, the owner of the “scout” said: It is not like that, and something came from the construction of a doctrine?Rather, your saying: I have a hand, entered into the cake and became a cake, and the clouds were ragged, entered into the straw, and wandered any income in the excess, and it is the opposite of the bush And the pain entered the day, and as for the righteousness of a cake and rash, it was accompanied and raised.The second question: they mentioned in the interpretation of his saying: he walks on the face of his face with faces: one of them: it is that it is that he who walks in a place otherwise It is scattered, and it is scattered every hour, and it is covered on the face of it.And the second: that the arbitrary who walks like this, and so on the ignorance and confusion, is not the same And the two.And the third of it: that the blind that does not guide the way, and it is regretted, and it is still attached to its face.Whoever said: This is the story of the state of the infidel in the hereafter, Qutdah said: The infidel is dominated by the toug of God, and God gave him the day of resurrection on his face, and the believer was on the authority of God The exalted on the level is the day of the resurrection, and others said: Rather, this is the story of the believer, the infidel, the scholar, and the ignorant in the world, and they are different from them, so whoever said: The believers and the disbelievers, and among them who said: Rather, what is meant by a specific person, so a fighter said: What is meant by Abu Jahl and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Jahl and Hamza bin Abd al -Muttalib, and Ikrama said: He is the father of Jahl and Ammar ibn Yasser.
