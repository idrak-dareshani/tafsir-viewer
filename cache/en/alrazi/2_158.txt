The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty that the description and the murmur are among the rituals of God, so whoever performs the pilgrimage of the house or is a lumin Institutions: The first question: Know that this verse is related to what was before it from the faces: one of them: that God Almighty has shown that it is the one who turned to the kiss of the kaab Muhammad ﷺ and his nation with the brilliance of Barahim and his debt on what he said: And my grace was fulfilled on you and the pursuit was between the Safah and the Maron of the ritual of the rituals By building the heels and pursuing it, he migrated between the two mountains, so when the matter was, as well as God, the Almighty mentioned this judgment, the one who is the one who is the verse of that verse.And the second: that he is exalted when he said: Let us give you something of fear and hunger to his saying: And the good news of the Saberin said: The locking and the bitterness of the rituals of God, but the rituals of God.Because they are the effects of immigration and hearing from what was done on them from Al -Ballawi, and they inferred that on the one that those who were patient with the Ballawi must reach the greatest and highest.And the third of it: that the sections of the mandate of God are the highest of three: one of them: what the mind rules with its goodness at the beginning And thank me and do not atone [Al -Baqarah: 152], because every sane person knows that the remembrance of the blessing with praise, praise, and perseverance on his thank you.And the second: what the mind rules with its ugliness at the beginning of the matter, except that it is due to the arrival of the legitimacy with it, it is a good thing Like the arrogant in the minds; Because God Almighty does not interact with him and the servant is from him, then that was like a slaughtered, except that the law was when he responded to him and he said, and he said: Let us give you something of fear and hunger, then the Muslim believes his goodness, and he is ruling and right.And the third of it: the matter that is not guided, neither to its good nor to its ugliness, but rather it is considered like the empty and free from the (P-143) who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the verb of the pilgrimage from the end of the pilgrimage, So God Almighty mentioned this division, the head of the first two divisions, so that he had alerted all the sections of his destruction, and for all of them, and the sake of all, and the sake of the sake, Know.* * * One and collected on my ranks and despair as it is said as a stick and a stick, and a tragedy and the tracke up.One of him is a grace, Jarir said: If the enemy is ours We have a deaf stone, and in the book of the cell: the huge stones, the stroke, the smoothness, and if they called the rock, they said: The grade of Safwah, and if they remember, they said: He made the luxury and the grace as if they were in a single sense, and the cold said: Safah is every stone that is not mixed with it, other than the clay or dust, connected to it, Al -Marwah, the caliphate said: From the carpentry, it was not the same as the September of the Solid Habbah, and others said: It is the small carpentry, a group in the few, and in the ritual Dhihab: ؎ As if I am a bitter tester, with the description of the feelings, every day is biting.The rituals of God, God Almighty said: The body made it for you from the rituals of God [Hajj: 36], meaning a sign for the closeness We hold it and the ritual of the ritual, and it is the notification of the Sunnah: It is to be aware of the city, so this is a knowledge of the war of its owner, and that he has made it, and he has made him The rituals are in the war, which is the mark in which one of the two categories is shown from the other, and the rituals are a collection of poetry, and it is taken from the notice that is the media, and it is the one who says: I knew.The third question: the rituals are either we carry it on worship or on the human being, or we carry it on the positions of worship and the human being, for if we say it in the first place; Because the soul of the two mountains is not valid for them to be a debt and a forgetfulness, so what is meant by it is that the circumambulation is between them and the pursuit of the religion of God, and if we say: Because these two mountains can be a place for worship and your prayers, and how it was so the sake between these two mountains is one of the rituals of God, and the rituals of God, and the rituals of God The highest of the nation of Muhammad ﷺ and the Abraham - peace be upon him - before that, and he is one of your prayers that God said of the exalted on the authority of His Excellency - peace be upon him - that he said: He said: He said: It is not a complete worship in itself, but rather it becomes a worship if it becomes some of the pilgrims, for this secret, God has explained the Almighty, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the authority of the one who is in which the servant is in the authority Whoever performs the pilgrimage or is a luminous, then there is no ward to it.* * * The loyal question: the rule on the law of this pursuit of the famous story is that the migrant of the mother of Asmail when (P -144) was narrowed by the matter in the thirst of it.May the peace be upon him - may God bless her with the water that he followed for her and her son from Zamzam until he knew the creation that he was grayed by him, even if he does not leave him in the first place He was a closeness Whoever calls, for he is the height of the desired, so look at the state of immigration and hearing how their relief and answered their supplication, then made their actions an obedience to the whole of the whole, to the whole of the whole, And their effects are a valid for the good ones as a whole to know that God does not waste the reward of the beneficiaries, and all of that is achieved for what he has told him before that Fear, hunger, and shortening of money, breath, and precursors, except that those who were patient with that won the happiness in the two house * * * The fifth question: the lock is mentioned in the word of the pilgrimage: the first: the pilgrimage in the language is a lot of conflict to something and the hesitation of it, so whoever visits the house, then he visited the house, then he visited the house, then he visited the house, then he visited the house, so whoever goes to him First to know him, then he will return to the circumambulation, then he will be spent to whom, then he will return to him to the circumstances of the visit, then he will return to the cruise of the chest.The second: Qatarb said: The pilgrimage is said: The argument of your face, and that is to cut the hair from the aspects of the gospel to enter the arguments in the shirt, so the meaning of the meaning: He was shaved, Al -Qafal said, and this is an impermissible for his saying: To enter the mosque, the forbidden.He expressed the throat of that, so it is not far from the pilgrimage to be called this name for the meaning of the throat.The third: The people of Hajj said: It is said: a man who is burnting, and a place of Hajj if it is an exclusive, and from that the pilgrimage of the way, then the house was not.The type of worship is called for that Hajj, and the lock said: The first saying is more likely to be the right; Because their saying: a man is a pilgrim, but he is different from it once after another, and the pilot of the way is the one who has many of the path.As for Umrah, the people of the language said: The domain is the intention and the exercise.Abd al -Qais: the mosque, the sale, and the church.Because the domain is wrapped in the house, the description and the bitter, then he is spent like the visitors, and as for the wing, it is from their saying: He is a wing of such money, and he said: So he was delighted for it [Al -Anfal: 61] and the ship was curled.For her elders, and the wing of the bird from this; Because it is inclined in one of its sins and does not fly at the level of his creation, so you have proven that his origin is from the inclination, then from the people who said: He remained in the Qur’an, so what is the Qur’an.(There is no wing on it), and when it was mentioned in the Qur’an: There is no money for anyone He has a student of things, and among them is those who said: Rather, he is specialized in the inclination to the falsehood and to what he praises.And his saying: To degrade them, that is: it is compromised, and the Tax was tweed in the Ta'a, as he said: Oh, the influence [Al -Muddathir: 1] Oh, the miserable [Al -Muzammil: 1] And the symmetrical, and it is said: flooded and wrapped in one means.* * * The prevailing question: the appearance of his words is up to the Almighty: there is no ward on him that there is no sin on him, and who is true to him that there is no sin (p-145) The delegate and the permissible, and then each one is distinguished from these three from the other with an increased restriction.With a duty; Because the referral indicated on the destiny between the sections, there is no significance in which the bit of the time is for the privacy of the return to another indication, if you know this, then it is a matter of this May God have mercy on him - that this pursuit is a pillar, and the blood does not take place, and when Abu Hanifa - may God have mercy on him - is not a blessing, and he will be blessed.Al -Zubayr, and a vial, and giving, that whoever left him is nothing for him, the Hajj of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - from his face You have to seek help from you.Because it requires the pursuit of the pursuit, which is the enemy, that is not and we have to say: We do not surrender that the pursuit is a phrase for the enemy with the evidence of his saying: There is no obligation, and God Almighty said: And that there is no human being except for what he sought [Al -Najm: 39] and that the enemy is not intended, but the grandfather and the guidance in the intention and the intention, But the enemy is a description of a row that is left to work with it in the right of this characteristic, so the origin of the walk remains and obligatory.And the second: What was proven that he - peace be upon him - sought what we have ever in his argument, and he said: “The description and the murder are among the rituals of God.Until the house saw, and if it is proven that he - peace be upon him - he seeks, he must have to seek help from the Qur’an and tell us, but the Qur’an: He said: You loved God, so they followed me [Al -Imran: 31] and his saying: You have been in the Messenger of God, a good level [Al -Ahzab: 21].As for the news, he said: I have your suffering, and the matter of the jungle.And the third of it: that it was raised in a seat from the sacrifice of the sanctuary, or it is brought in it in a complete warrant, so its gender was a poured as the hoop of the resurrection, and it is not obligatory.Because the words of the Sans are for his husband once, and the father of Hanifa - may God be pleased with him - brought him - with two Jahin: one of them: this is the verse and it is the saying of it It must be depleted with them, and this is not said in the obligations.Then, he has affirmed that with his saying: Whoever vows good, indicates that he was voluntarily and not a duty.And secondly: His saying: “The Hajj is a definition.” It is in the pursuit, and the answer to the first is from his face And otherwise, there is no significance in it on the negation of the garment, and that is achieved by the saying of the Almighty: It is not for you to be a wing that you are short of the prayer.When Abi Hanifah is obligatory, with him he said in it: So there is no wing on him, so this is here.The second: He raised the wings from the circumambulation with them, not from the circumambulation between them, and for us the first of us is not obligatory, but the second is the duty.The third: Ibn Abbas said: He was a class and on the bitterness of the idol, and the people of the ignorant people were floating with them and wiping them with them, so when the Islam came, the peace came Between them for the sake of the two idols, then God Almighty revealed this verse, if you know this, then we say that the pornography is the existence of the two idols in the case In the garment, a spiral is easy for you, or the blood of the gorgeous with us, so it was said: There is no wing that you have to pray in it, because the raising of the wing does not turn to the place of the wing to the place that does not go to the place of the wing, not to the place of the wing, not to the place of the wing, not to the place of the wing, not to the place of the wing, not to the place of the wing, not to the place of the wing.The prayer.Al -Rabaa: It was narrated from Aroudah that he said to Aisha: I see that I do not embarrass me in that I do not float with them, and she said: He told what was presented from the two idols, and the interpretation of Aisha is a success on the interpretation of the two followers, so if they said: Ibn Mas'oud read: (then there is no jinn (P-146) With them), and the memorization is also an innervilian as his saying: God shows you to mislead [Women: 176], meaning that you do not mislead, and like the Almighty: to say: It is: not to say, say: the abnormal reader cannot be adopted in the Qur’an; Because she corrected it, he praises in the vicinity of the Qur’an.Fifth: As he said: There is no wing on him, it is not called the duty, so as well as it is not called the delegate, and there is no doubt that the pursuit is a delegate Doing her back.As for the holding of his saying: Whoever volunteers is good and weak; Because this does not require that what is meant is from this voluntary is the remote tawaaf at first, but it is permissible for the intended one to be something other than that A ravine is a poor food [Al -Baqarah: 184] Then he said: Whoever volunteers is better, it is better for him, so the food is obligatory for them, then we will be brought to them With good, the meaning was: Whoever is voluntary and increased on the food of poor people was good, so so here it is possible that this is a vulnerability to the one who is a place of time, and it is one of them It increases in the flood, and it is more floating from the duty, such as the eight or more.الثّانِي: أنْ يَتَطَوَّعَ بَعْدَ حَجِّ الفَرْضِ وعُمْرَتِهِ بِالحَجِّ والعُمْرَةِ مَرَّةً أُخْرى حَتّى طافَ بِالصَّفا والمَرْوَةِ تَطَوُّعًا, وأمّا الحَدِيثُ الَّذِي تَمَسَّكُوا بِهِ فَنَقُولُ: That hadith is a public and our hadith is in particular, and the private is presented over the year, and God knows.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Whoever volunteers is good, he has the best: It is voluntary, except that the vita was tweet in the Ta'a for their approach, and this is better because the meaning is in the interest, and the condition and the reward are good in them.It is said: Whoever enters me, and the past signs the signed of the receipt in the penalty, except that the memorization if he agreed to the meaning was better, and the rest of the readers (the readers) And the adoption of a past, and this reader undertakes two things: one of them: that a position (voluntarily) is rewarded.The second: that it is not made (from) for the part of the part, but it is a house (who) and it is starting, and the fulfillment of what is after it in the place The communication, and the meaning has a meaning that begins with the news, except that this fulfillment if it enters into the news of the connector or the disintegratedness, it was reported that the second is the second.As his saying: And what is with you from the grace, so from God [Al -Nahl: 53] What is the beginning of a communication, and the fulfillment with what is after it is a news for him, and his counterpart is the saying: 274] To his saying: Perhaps their reward and his saying: Those who have destroyed the believers [Al -Buruj: 10] to his saying: Perhaps the torment of hell and his saying: And his saying: Whoever disbelieves, he has enjoyed him a little [Al -Baqarah: 126] [Cave: 29] And we remember this question, if God wills, when he said: Those who spend their money with night and day in secret and in a secret [Al -Baqarah: 274].The second question: The father of Muslim said: (Volunteer).And act in the sense of a lot of action, and the diversion is the purpose, and the diversion is what you want from the same soul, which is not obligatory for you.The third question: Those who said: The pursuit is obligatory, so they are pleased with this varying with the increased capacity on the amount The second that is not obligatory, and the good said: What is meant From it all obedience, and this is the first; Because he agreed to the perfect perfect.* * * As for His Exalted Him: God is a well -known knowledge, so I know that the complainant in the language is the appearance of the dowry of it, and that is in the right of God, the exalted A metaphor, and the metaphor of obedience: Rather, the reward was called obedience, thankful for its faces: The first: that the memorization came out of the exaggeration of the kindness of the servants of the servants, As he said: Who is the one who lends to God a good loan [Al -Baqarah: 245] and he is not analogy of compensation, but he is kind in the domain, as if he said: The lease is to be presented and takes the most weak.The second: The thank you, when it was compared to the public or the penalty upon him, was called everything that was a penalty on the path of analogy.The third: As if he says: If I were rich in your obedience, I only make it from the signed in terms of it, even if it is true that I would benefit from it, and it would not be more.In the sentence, it is intended that the servant's obedience is an acceptance of God, and the occurrence of the coming of the acceptance in the maximum degrees.* * * As for his saying: knowledge, the meaning is that he knows the destiny of the part, so he does not underestimate the deserved right; Because he is a scholar of his ability, and a scientist with what is more on him is the preference, and he is not aware of the words to be the Almighty saying: “I know that he is stuck”.He is aware of what the servant comes, so he will be offended by worship and salvation and what he does, not at this limit, and that is a desire to perform what is obligatory to be guided.
