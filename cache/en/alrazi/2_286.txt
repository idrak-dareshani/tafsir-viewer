The researcher is the Almighty: God does not cost a soul except for it and has what it has earned and on it what our Lord has gained, and do not take us if we forget or make us wrong with the knowledge that we know that the one who knows is that The first: His saying: God does not cost a soul except its capacity, and it is required to be the news of a news from God and it is necessary for a story to be a story about the Messenger and the one who is the one who is the one His saying: And they said: He heard us and obeyed your forgiveness, our Lord, and you are the destiny, and they said: God does not cost a soul except its capacity and support that of what we have said: As if he transcended them from their way of holding them with faith and good deeds, and he told them in the sentence of that, that they described their Lord that he does not cost him.The second question: In the syntax of the systems: We said that this is one of the words of the believers, so he directed the system that when they said, he heard us and obeyed us, so they said: The Almighty only cost us what is in our capacity and our energy, so if it is the highest of the judgment of the divine mercy, we only call us with the easy thing.That we are the most obedient, and if we say: This is from the words of God, the Almighty, so the arrogance is directed that when they said: He heard us and obeyed us, then they said: They said: (Your forgiveness) is a request for forgiveness, while they are released from the faces of negligence from them on the path of the pillar, so when they said: (He is forgiven) That default, there is no crime, God has reduced them to that, and he said: God does not cost a soul except its capacity and the meaning is that if you hear and obey you The type of shortening from you signed from you the path of the pleasure and the negligence, so you will not be disobedient from it, because God is up to the soul that does not cost a soul except for it, and it is for it, Their prayers in their saying: our forgiveness is our Lord.The third question: it is said: the thing is destroyed by it, and it is costly, and the cover is a name of it, and the expansion is what the human being is and does not narrow it and does not embarrass him, and he said: And the effort, and some of them said: The stinging is without the unknown in the hardship, which is expanded by the ability of the human being.The following question: the dismissed, they are dependent on this verse in that it is an exalted person who does not cost the servant what he does not tolerate and does not appreciate it, and the opposite of it, and what is the one who says: Religion is from an embarrassment [Hajj: 78)], and his saying, God wants to relieve you of you [Women: 28], and his saying, God wants you to the secret [Al -Baqarah: 185] and they said: This is what is good.Filled into unbearable, they said: And if this is proven, then the first: The first: that the servant is found for the act of himself By doing, it is not It is unbearable, for God is exalted, if the verb creates a place, neither a referral nor the destiny of the good for the servant on that action and no on its blessings, either that there is no power for it The verb was found in the capacity of God Almighty, and the supply is not found secondly, or that there is no ability for him to pay off, because his ability is a weakness, so he is the most powerful, His estimation is to pay the power of God, and if God does not create, it is impossible for the servant to be able to obtain, so he has proven, so he has proven that he was For the verb of the servant is God, the Almighty, for the abuse of the servant to the verb, to cost what is unbearable.The second: that the obedience before the verb, otherwise the disbeliever was commanded by faith, was not led by faith, so that the mandate was not unbearable in this way.Place.* * * As for the companions, they said: The indicators indicated the stipulation of the expression on this direction, so the destiny is required to take on this verse.The first pilgrimage: that whoever dies on the infidels predicts his death on the infidels that God Almighty was a scholar in the eternal that he dies on the infidels and does not believe in a cat, so the knowledge of the knowledge of the And the knowledge of the soul of faith contradicts the existence of faith on what we decided in the positions, and it is also an advance between its own Approximately by gathering between the two clashes, and this is the argument as it is a neighbor in science, it is also a neighbor in album.The second pilgrimage: that the act of the verb from the servant stands on the preacher, and that preacher is a creature for God, and when the matter was like that, it was not the same We said: The truth of the verb from the servant stops the preacher; Because the power of the servant, when it was righteous for act and leaving, if one of the two sides would like to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely, it is necessary We denied the artists, but we said: That preacher from God Almighty is because it was if it was from the servant, it would not be able to find it to another call, and it was necessary for the siblings.Likewise, the algebra was required; Because when the premature preacher is obtained for one of the two parties, the other side has become a desirable, and the one who is worse is the prohibition of the fog Frames because it is not left of the two inconsistencies, so the breasts of faith from the infidel be a mute and it is costly to it, so the cost is not unbearable.The third pilgrimage: that the mandate is either directed to the servant if the two advocates are raised, or if they are one of them, if the first is the first, then it is not the same.The two rituals are contradicted, so if it is assigned to the inclusion of the level of rumors, then it has been charged With the collection between the two contradictions, and if the second is the most obligatory, and the one who wanders is obedient, and if the seizure is made with the righteous, then it was done, and it is necessary, and it is necessary, and it is necessary, The prohibited.The fourth pilgrimage: that he has assigned Abu Lahab with faith, and faith is the truth of God in everything that has been informed of him, and it is what was told that he does not believe, so he has not believed that It does not believe, and that is the unbearable.Fifth Hajj: The servant is not a scholar of condolences to his act; Because whoever moved his stains, he did not know the number of sometimes that he moved in it, because the slow movement is a dilem And the servant was not dangerous in Him that he moves at some time, and he lives in some of it, and that where does it move and where he is still, and if he is not a scholar, then he is not a scholar It is found for it; Because he did not intend to find that special number of verbs, so if that number would do so without the uniforms and without the shortage, then it is not possible for it to be the case.That the servant is not found, then if it is not found, it was not unbearable to be unbearable to what you mentioned, then this is a mind in the mind of this (P-123) must be for a verse from the interpretation and in which it is in it: They believe them and it is referred; Because it is a group between the two clashes, or to lie to them while it is referred; Because it is the heroes of the two, either to deny the mind, and the hearing phenomenon is more likely, and that is required to be stabbed in the evidence of the mind, and the mind is the mind.The heroic of the neutrality, the prophecy, and the Qur’an.And the prevalence of the hearing indicative is required in the mind and the hearing evidence together, so it remains only that he was cut off with the authenticity of the evidence of the mind.The hearing on the interpretation, and this is the one who is ever -disturbed by it in the payment of shadows in which the people of the suspicion are used For this verse is interpreted in the sentence, whether we know it or we do not know it, and then it does not need the excess in it on the way of detail.The second face in the answer: It is that there is no meaning to cost in the matter and the end, except to inform the fact that when it does so that it is so that it is rewarded, and when it does not do it, then it is the same If the one who is taught to it was possible, that was an order and a mandate in the truth, or not in the truth, as it was a mandate, but it was a flag in the ritual of the ritual, and it was in the past It was created for the fire.The third answer is that a person is as long He dies on infidels or not like that, so we are complaining about the resurrection of the obstacles His death was that the objection was a right in his right.It turns out that the condition of the mandate was a state of his state of his life, and this is the saying of a sect of the feet of the people of al -Jabr.The following answer: I showed us that his saying: God does not cost a soul unless it can help God Almighty, but he is the saying of the believers And that is because God is exalted when he told them about the praise of the praise for them and the praise is upon them, so because of these words, they must be honest in these words, for if they were not, for they are not.It is permissible to glorify them with the cause of it, so this is the best that can be said in this position, and we ask God the great to be merciful to us, and we are not.We only ask the truth, and we only believe.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: It has what she has gained and on her, she did not gain in his questions: the first question: they disagreed that it is in the language a difference between the one, the one who is a separation, the one who is the one who is the one who said: May God have mercy on him: The righteousness of the people of the language is that the gain and the acquisition are one, and there is no difference between them.That is, God Almighty said: Every soul has caused a hostage [Al -Muddathir: 38] and said: And do not gain every soul except for it [Al -Anam: 164] and he said: His sin [Al -Baqarah: 81], and he said: Those who harm the believers and the believers other than what they have acquired [Al -Ahzab: 58], so this is indicated by the residence of every one of the one who is one of the one who is one of the words of this People who delivered the difference, then in it say: One of them: that the acquisition is more special than the gain; Because the gain is divided into its gain for itself and others, and the acquisition is only what the human being acquired for itself (P-124), especially it is said: It is said: It is attributed to his family, and the second: The owner of the “scout” said: It was special for the goodness, and the evil of acquisition; Because the acquisition is a matter of things, when evil was what the soul desires, and it is attracted to it, and it was emirated by it.It is attributed to it, and when it was not in the chapter of good, it was described as there is no significance in it on the anxiety, and God knows.The second question: the disgraceful of this verse is that the servant did by finding it and forming it, they said: Because the verse is good in the addition of it, and it is good That is to create God Almighty, for this addition and the breasts of his actions from him, the course of his color, his length, his shape, and the bridges of the affairs of the matter The bit and the words are known, and by God the success.The judge said: If it was Creating their actions, so what is the benefit in the cost?As for the face that they ask him that they do not hear them and the ritual of their saying, as the light is that he is the highness that creates it in them, and it is not for them.* * * The third question: our companions took this verse to the corruption She has caught the punishment of what she had been acquired, and this is clear that these two investigations are collectively, and that it is not necessary for one of them the disappearance of the other, he said: It indicates the release, except that it is the conditions and the estimation: it has what it has earned from the reward of good deeds if it does not invalidate it, and on it what was caused by the punishment, then it is not disbelieve We have become a matter of this condition, when we have indicated that the reward must be a permanent, pure, and permanent, and that the punishment must be harmful, pure, and permanent, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, The minds, so the collection was among their investigations, too.And know that the speech on this question passed through the exclusion in the interpretation of his words, the Almighty: Do not invalidate your charity with whom and harm [Al -Baqarah: 264], so we do not.* * * The following question: a many of those who speak to this verse that God Almighty does not torture the kindness of the sins of their fathers, and the sins of their fathers, In it, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: and there is no vision, and the last button [Al -Anam: 164].* * * Fifth question: The jurisprudence, they are held by this verse in the evidence that the origin is in the constipation, the survival and the recipient; Because the pain is in his saying: It has no reason for the confirmation of this division, and this is confirmed by his saying ﷺ: People are all together.From it that the guarantees do not possess the performance of the guarantee; Because the requirement of the ownership is based, and it is his saying: it has what has been caused and the exhibitors, the anger is either, or the guarantee, and they do not obligate the disappearance of the king.And from it that if he was spawned in a yard and brought it into his burst, or a ruggedness, then the king does not go away because the king does not go away to say it for it what it has earned.And from it that there is no intercession for the slaughterhouse; Because the requirement of the possession of the property is an existing, and it is his saying: It has what has been caused and the difference between the Shurak and the neighbor is an apparent manner that the neighbor is not presented to the evil The level is that the damage (P-125) with the mixture of the neighbor is less and because in the polytheism it needs to be carried by the affiliation of the division, and this meaning is inconvenient in the neighbor.And from that the piece does not prevent the obligation of the guarantee; Because the requirement of the ownership of the property is an existing, and it is his saying: it has what it has caught and the piece is not obligatory.The rest is standing, for it is obligatory to return it to money, and the piece is not required to remove the king of his property.And from the fact that the denial of the zakat is brought in it, and its answer is that the evidence required for zakat is more special, and the private is presented over the year, and the sentence is in this way in the first place Jurisprudence and God knows.* * * Then know that he is the Almighty who told the believers their supplication, and that is because he ﷺ said: “The supplication is the brain of worship” because the preacher sees his soul in the soul And the household and the majesty of God is witnessed, honored, attributed, and his greatness, by preventing the exploitation and transgression, and it is the one who is intended from all worship and obedience, so this is the goodness of this The mourning that is disgraceful to these great sciences with supplication and the burden to God, and the words in the truths of the supplication are mentioned in the interpretation of my saying: Qaraib [Al -Baqarah: 186] He said: Our Lord does not take us if we forget or make us wrong and in the verse of the questions: The first question: Know that he is the highest of the believers in the believers, Each one of it is read by his saying: (Our Lord) is only in the good type of supplication, for he has deleted this word from it, and he said: He will forgive us.As for the first type, it is his saying: Our Lord does not take us, if we forget or make us wrong with questions: One; Because the people have been able to himself, and the path of the path to it with his verb, so he became the one who punished him with his sins as the one who is sufficient for himself in his soul, and for his soul in his soul, and for his soul, and for his soul.Another, which is that God takes the sinner with the punishment, so the sinner is as if he takes his Lord with the students with pardon and generosity, for he does not find someone who is the one who finds it For this, the servant holds it with the fear of it, so when each of them was taken by the other, he expressed it with the memorial of the reason.The second question: in the forgetfulness and Jahan: The first: that what is meant by him is the forgetfulness of its soul, which is against the remembrance.If it was said: Is it not that the deed of the people in the place of forgiveness with the judgment of the mind of the mind where it is not permissible to lengthen what is unable The mistake and the forgetfulness and what they are derived from it.The answer to him is from his faces: The first: that the forgetfulness is from him what is excused in his owner, and from him what is not excused not to see that whoever sees in his garment is blood, then he is late, so he will be removed from him, so he will be removed from him, so he will be removed from him, so he will be removed from him.His garment is short, as the initiative was obligated to remove it, and if he did not see it in his garment, then he will be excused in it, and whoever throws a fold in a place in a person, then a person is in a man It is where Al -Rami does not know that he is afflicting That hunter or otherwise, then if he was threw up and did not embrace it, it is not blamed, but if the signs of the mistake are not apparent, then he threw and wounded a human being, then he was excused, and if you were excited The lesson and the repetition until we forget the Qur’an (P-126) is blamed, and if he remains on the readers, but after that, he forgot, and he will be the same Two sections: From it what is excused, and it is not excused, and it was narrated, "It was that if he wanted to remember his need, he tightened a steps in his sake." She has proven what we mentioned that the people may not be excused, and that is if the memorization left and exposed the reasons for the remembrance, and if it is so, it is true.The second face in the answer: that this is a supplication on the way of appreciation and that is because these believers who mentioned this supplication were for the sake They are released from what is not overlooked except on the face of the forgetfulness and the sin, so it was described by the supplication with that, a notice of the views of their coast You can take it, so do not take us with it.The third face in the answer: that the intended of the supplication is to disturb the rises to God Almighty, not to seek the verb, and that is, the preacher is a lot of what he calls for what he calls It is done by whether he is called or did not call, God Almighty said: Lord, judge the truth [Al -Anbiya: 112] and he said: Our Lord, and we have come to us, and you have prepared us on your messenger and do not store us on the day Their prayers: forgive those who repent and follow your path [Ghafir: 7] So this is in this verse that is knowledgeable that the forgetfulness is forgiven that is not forbidden in goodness.The luxury face in the answer: that the delay of the people is not mindful, and that is because if a person knows that after the forgetfulness, he will be a delay, then he will be taken.The remembrance is evaluated, so it is not released from it, except that the sustainability of that remembrance is difficult to do with the soul, so when it was permissible in the mind, not The forgiveness from him by supplication.Fifth face: that our companions who permit you to cost in an unbearable, and they hold this verse, so they said: The people are not able to do so, so it is not possible It is permissible for a mind from God to be punished for him, as he was asked for the supplication, the sharing of the reward for it.And the second saying: In the interpretation of the forgetfulness, to be carried on the blessing.Leave the work of God and leave them, and the man says to his companion: Do not forget me from your giving, that is, do not leave me, so what is meant by this forgetfulness is to leave the action, so that the action is left.What is meant by mistake is to do the verb to be interpreted corrupt.The third question: It is noteworthy that the forgetfulness and the one who is mentioned in this verse is either that they are interpreters with an interpretation in which he does not want to do so One of them is like that without the other.Because the baptism is to disobedience, when he was in the forgetfulness and in error, then he is the one who commanded Muslims to invite him with their saying: Do not take us if we have forgotten us, so we will be forgotten or not From God, He is glorified to ask them to ask God not to torture them on the sins, and when he commanded them to ask that, he will give them to this aspiration, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, For the companions of the cabares.As for the second and third division, it is invalid; Because the reason for that is a chaos at the sectarianism, and the ugliness of its action from God is obeyed to be required of the supplication.(P-127) It was said: The people may be taken in the movement of preservation, intended and baptized on what you decided in the advanced question.We said: In the truth, it is a reasoning by the blessing of the memorization, with a purpose and intent, so the disagreement is, but it was obtained on what it left in a pillar, and the appearance of what is mentioned is the same.Pardon for the people of Al -Kabbir.* * His Excellency said: Our Lord, and do not carry us as an insult to us as you carry it on those who were before us.اعْلَمْ أنَّ هَذا هو النَّوْعُ الثّانِي مِنَ الدُّعاءِ وفِيهِ مَسائِلُ: المَسْألَةُ الأُولى: الإصْرُ في اللُّغَةِ: الثِّقَلُ والشِّدَّةُ, قالَ النّابِغَةُ: ؎يا مانِعَ الضَّيْمِ أنْ يُغْشى سُراتُهُمُ والحامِلَ الإصْرَ عَنْهم After what they knew, then the covenant was named after he was a heavy, God Almighty said: And you took my insults [Al -Imran: 81], meaning my covenant and my charter, and the insult is the one who is said: Right, any mercy and a relative, but the kindness was named; Because your compassion is overwhelmed by your heart, everything that leads to him.The second question: The people of the interpretation mentioned in it and are subject to two sides: Fifteen prayer, and command them to perform a quarter of their money in zakat, and whoever has a ritual ritual is a command that is commanded to cut it, and if they forgot something, they would have forgotten it.The world, and if they came with a sin, they were deprived of food, some of what was permissible for them, God Almighty said: So, he is an ugliness of those who have been forbidden to them: We wrote to them to kill themselves or to get out of your path, so they did only a little of them [Women: 66], and he was forbidden to the travelers from the people of the people of the people of the Urgent in the world, as he said: Before we are tired of faces, and they were dirty a penny and a pig, the cloth said: Whoever looks at the Fifth Travel of the Fifth What these Jews claim and stood up to what was taken from them from the thickness of the righteousness and the events, and the many surprises saw the believers, so the believers have asked them that they are the Lord of them.Talfalism, and he is preferred and his mercy has removed that of them.Peace: ““ I was raised from my nation, the mud, the luster, and the place.” “I was sent by the solemn easy.” And the believers only demanded this lightness because the tension is the thought of the default, and the default is obligatory for the punishment, and there is no energy for the torment of God In the talisman.And the second saying: Do not bear a covenant and a covenant that resembles the covenant of those before us in thickness and adult The mandate, so the first saying is the first.The third question: for a saying that he says: The mental evidence and the hearing indicated that it is the generosity of the perceptions and the merciful (P-128) the merciful, so what is the one who is Taking to Jews until they led to their fall into violations and resurrection?The disgraced said: It is permissible for something to be reconciled in the right of a human being, spoiled in the right of others, so the Jews were rude and the rudeness, so they are overwhelmed, They used to reform except with the hard and intense coercion, and this nation was the tenderness and the generosity of creation is predominantly on their ears, so the worshipers were in their way Take out.The companions answered that the question that we mentioned in the first place we transfer to the second place, so we say: And why did Jews specialize in the rudeness They needed great tension in the crocodile, and why this nation specialized in the ritual rituals, the generosity of creation, and the height of the dignity until it is sufficient for them to suffice the time Do you reconcile them?.And whoever contemplates and describes the knowledge that this explanation is a manner, then the majesty of the majesty is on the authority of the balance of the delayed, and it is the one who does not do what he does and does not do what he does and does what he does.What do they do while they are asked.* * * His Excellency said: Our Lord, and do not carry us what we have no energy.Know that this is the third type of the supplication of the believers, and it contains issues: the first question: the energy is a name of the deeds, such as obedience from the obedience, and the lord of the answer.The second question: One of the companions is those who touched it in the fact that the unbearable is not permissible, if it was not permissible, it would not be good for his request to the claim of God.The dismissed answered On the authority of his faces: The first: that his saying: There is no energy to us, that is, he will make his action a great hardship, and it is as the man says: I do not see that he is a lord if he is a long time for him.The poet said: ؎ If you wrapped me, you did not obey your misfortune, what was left of me from the creation.In the hadith that the Prophet ﷺ said in the mamluk: “He has his food and his eclipse, and he is not charged with deeds that cannot be restricted.” And Amran ibn Al -Husayn narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: “ The power is on the rocks, but all the jurisprudence say: What is meant by it is if it is attached to it in the gels, a great hardship, and God said in the description of the disbelievers.Hearing [Hood: 20], that is, he was shocked by them.The second face: that it is high, and he did not say: Do not cost us what we have no energy for us, but he said: And do not bear what we have no energy for us and the lamb is that he does not have anything to do with him So that the torment and the meaning will not be carried by your torment, which we do not like to invoke it.Talking was his saying: Do not carry us a metaphor in it, so the first was first.(P-129) The third face: He endowed that they asked God to be upset that they will not cost them On that, the saying of the Lord will be judged by the right [the prophets: 112] on the permissibility of governing falsehood, and so does the saying of Abraham, peace be upon him, does not indicate the poet.It is permissible to disgrace the prophets, and God Almighty said to his Messenger ﷺ and do not obey the infidels and the hypocrites [Al -Ahzab: 48] and this does not indicate that it is permissible to obey the disbelievers.Likewise, the words are in his saying, if you are partner, to love your work.The companions answered and they said: As for the first face: it is a burden from two faces: the first: that if he had said it and did not carry us what we have no energy in it, it is not the same The expression was its meaning and the meaning of the verse that is presented to it, and it is his saying and does not carry us to us as you carried it to those who are before us, so that it is one of us.Prepare and that is not permissible.The second: We have shown that the energy is the enemy and the ability, so it is said to it and do not carry us what is not the energy that we have to do with it.Installing in some of the roofs of the recovery on the path of the metaphor, but the origin is the sake of the memorizer on the truth.As for the second face: its answer is that the lowering is devoted to the Qur’an by the Qur’an.Exalted: We have presented safety on the heavens [Al -Ahzab: 72] to his saying and carried by the human being [Al -Ahzab: 72] Then he endowed that this karf was not found except that he said, and he did not say that he did not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he does not say that he said: The torment and in the depression must be seen on its appearance.As for the third face: his answer is that the verb of something if it is forbidden, the request for abstinence is permissible for him on the path of supplication and supplication, and it is a good manner, and it becomes good His prayers and his conversion: Our Lord does not collect between the two opposites and does not spoil the old one, as it is not permissible, so you are not mentioned.If this is proven, then he says: This is the original, then if that becomes stirred in some of the pictures for a separate evidence, it is not obligatory to leave it in the birds of the pictures.* * * The third question: Know that he remained in the verse asking: The first question: Why did he say in the first verse and do not carry us to us and said in this verse and do not carry this By launching?The answer: that the hardship can be carried by it, but it is not a destiny that cannot be carried, so it has an unbearable, it is the time, so it is a time.And the tendency can be able to do so, for this reason is for the other verse with the lamb.The second question: when he was asked to not cost him the hard verb, his saying and do not carry us with a way that was not due to his permissibility that he would not cost him what is unbearable, and on this, this is the opposite of this.Presse.“ This is that he works with the knowledge of God, his servant, his obedience, and the thanks of his grace.In your mind, and no thanks to your kindness and your gossip, nor a knowledge that is met by the sanctity of your greatness, for that is not appropriate for my remembrance and my goodness, and I have no, and I have no, and I have no, and I will not be.Ahead of the truth, which is not a crime that was not said, and does not carry us a statement presented in the remembrance of his saying, and do not carry us what is not energy for us.The third question: It is the Almighty who told the believers, this claim in the form of the collection, that they said: Do not take us if we forget us or make us wrong, and do not make us.From our before us and do not carry us what we have no energy for us, so what is good is in this group and the supplication of the supplication?The answer: The intended from it is that the acceptance of the supplication at the pleasure is more complete and that is because the inspiration has effects, then if the people and the reasons are gathered on the authority of the people.* * His Excellency said: He forgive us and forgive us and our mercy You are born, and we will be victorious to the infidels.Know that these three types of supplications were the one in which it was left and was a decision with the words (our Lord).And its appearance indicates the request of the verb, so it has two questions: The first question: Why did we not remember this, "our Lord"?Answer: The call is to need it at the distance.As for the closeness, it is not; Rather, the call was omitted by a notification that the servant, if he remains on the risk, has received the proximity of God Almighty, and this is a great secret that he will be informed of other drivers.The second question: What is the difference between forgiveness, forgiveness and mercy?The answer: that pardon is to be punished by punishment, and the forgiveness is that his generosity is made for him from the torment of shyness and the sacrifice, as if the servant says: Pardon, and if you pardon me, then he will be given to me, then the salvation is from the torment of the grave, but it is good if his obstacle gets the salvation from the torment of the light, and the first is the one who is the torment, the one who is the torment The spirituality, and when he was rid of them, he accepted the request of reward, which is also a row: the reward of a body, which is the nakedness of heaven, its pleasures, and its female, and the reward of the souls of the souls, The light of the majesty of God is exalted, and reveals to him the destiny of the energy on the authority of God, and that is that he will become absent from all that is only God Almighty, who is in the man God Almighty, and his saying (and peace be upon us) is a request for the generous reward and his saying after that, you are a request for the spirituality of the spirituality, and for the sake of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant God Almighty because his saying, you are a rhetoric for the two of the people, and perhaps a lot from (P-131) who are speaking, they will be excluded, this is the words of the words, and they
