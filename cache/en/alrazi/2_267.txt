The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: O you who believe!In it and know that God is a praiseworthy rich.Know that it is [the Almighty] who wanted to spend, then indicated that spending on two sections: from it what follows and harm follows, and from what is not followed by that.Then it is the Almighty, explaining what is attached to each of these two divisions, and he was confused for each one of them, for example, revealing the meaning and clarifying the one.(P-54) Then he is the highest mentioned in this verse that the money that he ordered in the path of God is how he is not able He said: (Outlin) What is meant by what?Al -Hasan said: What is meant by it is the zakat, and a people said: It is intended from the vigilance, and the third said: It is the imposition and the nafleh.The pilgrimage of the one who is intended from the Zakat al -Mufawadah: that his saying: (spend) is an order, and the appearance of the matter for the obligatory, and the obligatory spending is only the zakat and the one who is the one.The pilgrimage of those who said the charity of the virginity said: What was narrated from Ali ibn Abi Taleb, the generosity of God, his face, the good and the Mujahid: that they were believed by the righteousness Motherhood, so God revealed this verse.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them: “A man with a day came with a muddy mud, and he put it in the charity, so the Messenger of God said: Hands of this verse.The pilgrimage of those who said the imposition and the negligence within this verse: that the concept of the matter is like the side of the verb on the side of the leaving it, without it, or it is that it is that it is in it.It is not permissible, and this concept is destroyed between the imposition and the nafil, so they must be inside me under the matter.If you know this, then we say: As for the first saying, which is that it is for the answers, then it will be separated from the issues: The first question: The human being acquired, so the zakat of the merchant, the zakat of gold and silver, enters into it; Because that is what is described as a rented, and it is indicated by the garment of zakat in everything that the land alerts, on what is the saying of Abu Hanifah, the mercy of God, and the mercy of God A very back, except that its personnel devoted to this general, with his saying ﷺ: ““ There are no charity in the vegetables.The earth is a little or a lot, and the appearance of the verse indicates its saying, except that its personnel are devoted to this general, with his saying ﷺ: ”.The second question: They disagreed with the goodness of goodness in this verse on two sayings: the saying The first: It is good for money without the new one, so he called the good to be good at the goodness of the boss, and on this interpretation, then what is meant is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is intended to The bad verse.And the second saying, which is the saying of Ibn Masoud and Mujahid: that the good is the solution, and the vibrant is the forbidden.The first pilgrimage is a face: the first pilgrimage: that we mentioned in the reason for the descent that they believe in the calmness Good.The second pilgrimage: that the forbidden is not permissible to take it, neither in the past nor in a way that is cloudy, and the verse is indicated that the breach is permissible to take it in the clouds.Al -Qafil - may God have mercy on him - said: It is possible to be answered by him that what is meant is from the forgiving clouds and left the exclusion, so it is the meaning: and you are the meaning of you It is forbidden, except that you are diagnosed for yourself to take the forbidden, and do not get any face that you have taken money, the security of its permissible or from its forbidden.The third argument: that this saying is a saying by the Almighty saying: You will not obtain righteousness until you spend what you love [Al -Amran: 92] With the sporadic beads that the kingdom of the kingdom is derived, not the eclipse that must (P-55) must pay it from itself and its delia.The judge took the second saying and said: We have gathered that what is meant is good in this verse is either good or the halal, so if the first is prolonged, then the second is the same the first; Because what was meant, if he was good, was an order to spend the good good, whether it was forbidden or permissible, and that is not permissible, and the commitment of specialization is the disagreement It is not good, but the permissible.It can be mentioned in it for a third saying, which is that what is meant is good.It is not a saying that he said: The blame for his concept is not permissible; Because we say: The halal is called good because it is the mind and the religion, and goodness is called good because it is developed by the molorge and the lust, so it is the one A single concept between the two divisions, so the memorizer was based on it if it was proven that the good good from it; So we say: The Zakatian money is either that all of them are mourning or all of them are underestimated or be medium or be frustrated, so if the whole is a mourning, then the whole is a mourner Zakat is like that, and if all is a lustful, zakat is also from that zealous, and it is not a disagreement for the verse; Because the one who is taken in this state is not a loudness of that money, but if there is good and bad money, then it is said to the human being: Do not make the zakat from the ritual Your money, but if the money is mixed, then the duty is the mediator, he said ﷺ to Mu’az Bin Jabal, when he sent it to the Yemeni: They are their readers, and you and the monotheists of their money.What is meant by the charity of the voluntary, or our saying: What is meant by the obligatory spending and the voluntary is, so we say: God Almighty will delegate them until they are close to it, and they will be close to it.It is closer to the big bond with masterpieces and guidance, because it is necessary and that masterpiece is the best of what is in its kingdom and its honor, so we are so.It remains in the verse one question, which is that what is said is what is useful in the word “from” in his saying: And what we have brought out to you from the earth.And his answer: The estimation of the verse: they woke up from the goodness of what you have gained, and woke up from the good things that we have brought out to you from the earth, except that the remembrance of the goods when he got the same time The second is the first time.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Do not fulfill the heights, in his two questions: the first question: it is said: his nations, his death, and his mother, all of him said: ؎ I dumped a measure and how long it is from the ground from his task with the honor of the second question: Ibn Katheer read and alone.Because it was in the original, the two speeches, and the verb, so they tweed at the other, and those who open the conquest are light.And on this, the dispute in her sisters, which is three and twenty people: do not disperse, died, died, so they will be separated from you They took care, do not speak, shed it, beg, changed, supported, spy, deduct, to make it up, distinguish, you choose The angels descended, and we are the ones: the first search: Abu Ali said: This slurring is not permissible; Because the tunnel is dwelling, and if it is still, it is necessary that the thundering of the connection will be overflowed with it, as it was vigorously in the past of the past.But they gathered on the fact that the thunder of the connection does not enter into the horrors.(P-56) The second research: They disappeared in the deleted Tax on the readers of the public, so some of them said: It is the first time, and its Siboi is not brought up except the second, and the virginity is: It is possible for the rest of it.As for the saying of the Exalted: from it you spend.Know that in the Keyifa in the verse and Jahin: The first: that the words were made when he said: Do not complete the fabrication, then start, and he said: He said: They are in it in it, saying it: from it, you will spend on the path of denial, and the meaning: its security is spent with you that you do not take it except with it Overdrinking?.The second: that the words are fulfilled by his saying: except that you are overwhelmed in it and be the one In it, in it, and its counterpart is the addition of the Almighty saying: I have been grabbed with the pure veil, not separation for it [the cow: 256] and the meaning is not.As for his words, the Almighty: You will not take it, except that you turn in it in it in the issues: the first question: the ritual in the language is the hatred of the eyesight and the kindness Overwhelming, which is hidden, it is said: This words are metaphor, meaning: the hidden perception.The hidden overwhelming pyramid of the earth.The second question: In the sense of the clouds in this verse, it is the first: the first: that what is meant by the cloud is the ease, and that is because the human being if he sees what he sees.That is, then there was a lot until all the rivals and the ease in the sale and others are cloudy, so he said it: and you will take it except that you will be taken.To you, like these things, you did not take them except for brilliance and stubbornness, so how do you accept me for what you do not accept for themselves?!.And the second: that the clouds be carried on the one who says: I have closed the eyes of the dead and I closed it, and the meaning is that you take it unless you are closed, With the clouds and the degradation of the fruit.Then he concluded the verse with his saying: Know that God is a rich, praiseworthy, and the meaning is that he is rich in your charity, and the meaning of “Hamid”, meaning: Ma’mud is on the authority of what is.And in it is another face, which is that his saying: rich like a threat to give the bad things in the charity, and praise in the sense of Hamid, meaning: I am your best of what you do.As his saying: Those were their skepticism [Al -Asra: 19].
