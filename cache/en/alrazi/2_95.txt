The researcher is the Almighty: Say: If you have the last house for you, God is pure without people, then you will die if you are honest and will not They are their hands, and God is aware of the shadows.It is not permissible to say on the way of the reciprocate, if it is so and so, so do so, except that, and the first is his gold to be valid for the second commitment to it.And the second: What God narrated about them in his saying: And they said that he will not enter paradise except for those who were a sofa or Christians [Al -Baqarah: 111] and in his saying: We are the sons of God and God: The fire only touched us with numbers [Al -Baqarah: 80].And the third of it: their resignation in themselves is that they are the ones who are right because the copy is not permissible on their part, and that the parties of the team are invalid.And its pursuit of it: they are their belief that their affiliation with the majority of the Prophet, peace be upon them, means Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, who will save them from the punishment of God, to God Almighty, to their reward For these things, they have bone.And they were speaking to people about this suspicion of following Muhammad ﷺ, then God took over the corruption When God is pure without people, then they wish the death and the Bayan of this mandate that the blessings of the world are a little bit of the measurement to the blessings of the last I said it was a disobedience to them with the appearance of Muhammad and his ritual with them with the new and the fighting, and whoever was in the few blessings is that it is the same The death must be transmitted to that great blessing, for it is necessary and it is a desire in the death because that great blessings is required, and there is no way The one who is required to be based on it is required, so this person should be satisfied with the death, wishing him to him, so it was proven that the house was not They must wish the death.Then, God Almighty has told that they did not wish the death, but will never wish him, and then, the piece of their claim is necessary in their saying that the one is the one who is the one who is the one who said: Without people.If it is said that we do not surrender that if the last house had a pure house, they must wish the dead, and he said that the last of the last is the one And who is required to be required, it must be required.We said: The one who is required to be the one who is required To that weary, but it is a perception of itself, and the death is what is only with great pain and what they were restricting it, so it is not a crime of what you came to.The second: It was for them to flip this question on Muhammad ﷺ and they say: You claim that the last house is pure for you and your nation without those who are in the matter of you So he would be able to kill you and kill your nation, for we see you and see your nation in the hard harm and the great calamity in the caused of the newness and the fighting, and after the death, then you will be So you must accept your killing!The third question: Perhaps they would say the other house is pure for those who were on their debt, but by the condition of the bound by the cabin Fire is ever because they were fading or because they were married in the great owner to become tormented, for this is what you wish to die, and for no one to pay this They are gone that the fire does not touch them except for numbers, because every day from the days of resurrection is like a thousand years of what you prepare, so these were the days, and if it was a few days, if it was a few days The number, but it is long, according to the period, so it is not a crime that you wish to die because of this fear.The following question: that he, peace and blessings be upon him.To me and died if the death is better for me.It is forbidden for the seedlings, and then it limits the people with that.The fifth question: The memorization of the wish is a blessing between the wish that is the meaning that is based on the heart and between the memorizers that indicate that of that meaning, and it is the saying of the one who says: To say that you have asked us to wish and wish for a blessed memorial, for if we mentioned it with the tongue, then he may say: What I wanted is for this, but I want it, but I want it So that the meaning in the heart of the heart is to say: You have lied to what you have come with that in your hearts, and when the Jews knew that he came with a note, there is no blessing.They did not stop me.The sixth question: He endowed that the last house, even if it was for them, would not have to wish the death.Never weak because the reciprocate of this is correct, even if the Qur’an is truly established, and the conflict is only in it?.(Answer): His saying [first] as the voicing of the death is included in the mother, it is like a person who wished him, we say as it is The pain that occurs at the sophistication does not disagree with the sizes of the knowledge that the benefit that has the greatness of the sizes is great, and the matter must be like you.His saying secondly: If they had gone to the words on Muhammad ﷺ, he was obliged to be satisfied with the killing, we said: The difference between Muhammad, peace be upon him, and between them, was that he was I was sent to get the bouquet to the people of frequency, and this is what is meant, and it was not after this, so for this, I do not accept the killing, but you are like that His saying is third: They were afraid of the punishment of al -Kabbir, our saying: The people called as the other as the other, and that is for them to believe in them.His saying is raised: We are forbidden from the death of the death.The two ranks are circumcised in the roots of the good, and his son, good, said to him, may God be pleased with him, what is this with the merits The death, and Ammar, may God be pleased with him, said: P-174) ؎ The forbidden is a special reason for a special reason, for he is peace and blessings be upon him.Where is this from the wish that indicates the authenticity of the prophecy.Fifth saying: They did not know that what is meant is the one who wished for the tongue or the heart, we said: The wish in the language of the Arabs is not known only to what appears [from it] It appears with the saying that in the heart of that is not called this name, and also, then it is a referred to say that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, says: Al -Wahouf on him with the fact that the abuse of that is only fulfilled by its appearance.His Sixth said: What is the evidence that there is no wish, we said from his face With the appreciation of his numbers, the saying proves the health of the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ and the estimation of the inclusion of this wish, the saying of the saying of the saying Great creatures, so it must be transferred to a frequent transfer, and when it was not transmitted, we were not found.And the second: He is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, with his presumption in the opinion, the belief, and the goodness of the view in the punishment and the connection to the position, which he arrived in the world and the one who has been in the world and the one who has been in the world.The one who violates the opponent and the argument is an unimaginable voluntary, and it is not purely on the side The consequence of the situation is in it, and it is not safe for his characteristic to make it clear with the evidence and the argument, because the sane person who did not confuse the affairs is hardly satisfied with this, so the case is so He, peace and blessings be upon him, did not give up on the liberation of this evidence except that God has revealed to him that they do not wish for it.And the third of it: What was narrated is that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “If the Jews wish to die, they died and saw their bounty from the fire, and if the one who came out, they would not be brought out.They find a family or money.The pilgrims took place, so this is the last of the words in the report of this recipient, and we return to the interpretation.As for the saying of the Almighty: Say: If the last house is for you, then the paradise is considered because it is the one who is required from the hereafter without the fire, because they were claiming that they were good.* * * As for His Exalted, the Almighty said: When God is not intended, but the house is not the house, nor is it a distance as well in his pregnancy at the place, so perhaps the Jews, they were alleged, and they are almost.So God has invalidated all of that with the ancestors he mentioned.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: pure, so we will set up in the case of the last house, that is, peace be upon you, especially for you, there is no one in it, in which there is a right, meaning that it is true that it is true that it is true.Except for those who were obese or Christians and (people) for the Sans, and it was said: The covenant is the Muslims and the gender is the first to say it except for those who were a sophistication or the Christians, and it is not for us.* * * As for his saying: From the people, what is meant by it is only the meaning of the place, as the one who says to those who are gone from him says: This is for you without people.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: So you wish to die if you are true, then he has two questions: (P-175) The first question: This is a matter related to the condition of the condition Those who are honest, the matter is not in the way, and the sympathy of it is the determination and the appearance of their lies in their call.The second question: In this wish, they say: One of them is the saying of Ibn Abbas: they define themselves by calling the two sponsors to die on any of the vastness.The second: to say: If we die, we die, and this second is the first because it is close to the agreement of the word.As for his words, he will not wish for him, so he told him that he is not able to fall into the future, and this is a news about the unseen, because with the release of the reasons for the reasons And the ease of the two words with this word, informed that they do not come to that, for this is a assertive brother of an order that the Emirates rose against against it, so it is not possible for it to be.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty is: ever, it is another absence because it is informed that that is not found, nor in anything from the one who comes in the future, and no doubt that Al -Akhbar on his numbers with the lineage to the generalities of the hamat, they are Ghoban.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: What their hands came before, then there is a way for the cause that it does not wish for [the death] because if they knew their misfortune, they are the same That is until the death does not wish.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: God is knowledgeable with those who are unjust, then it is like a dazzle and a thunder because if he is aware of the secret and the Najwa, and it is not possible to hide anything from it.This is one of the greatest of the swords from the tinkers, but the unjust mentioned because every disbeliever is unjust and not every unjust is a disbeliever, so when it was a general, he was the one who is a long time Here: He will never wish him and said in Surah Al -Juma: And they never wish him [Al -Juma: 7] So he mentioned here (he will not) and in the surah of the gathering “No”?We said: They are in this surah, claiming that the last house is pure for those without people and called in the surah of the group that they are the guardians of God without God The two things are that if it was like that, they would not have died and the first preacher is greater than the second of the second, as the exclusive happiness is the one in the house of reward Maryam, except that it is intended to send it to paradise.The navigator, and when the second preacher was not in the end of the bone, it is not a crime, it was satisfied with its heights in the words “No” because it is not in the end of power in the statement of the meaning of the meaning.
