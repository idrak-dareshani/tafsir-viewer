The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, and we will give you something of fear and hunger, and the lack of money, breath, themes, and the human beings of the Saber (P -136), know that he said: Related to his saying: They seek patience and prayer, that is: seek patience and prayer, so we have disappeared with fear, and in it, and in it, he said: And thank me and do not atone for and thank you for more of what he said: If you thank you, I will increase you [Ibrahim: 7], so how do you say that he said: The answer is from Wajin: The first: that it is the highest that the biology is to complete the grace, so that was required to the thanks, then tell that the ritual of the one who does not have the same The cultivation, so it is not a matter of patience.The second: He was blessed first, and he commanded the thank you, then he was afflicted and commanded the patience, so that the man attained the argument of the Shakran and the patient with him, so he said: And peace -: “Faith is described: the half of patience and the half of thanks.” The second question: It was narrated from a gift, and the Bin Anas is that what is meant by this address is the companions of the Prophet ﷺ after the migration.* * * The third question: As for the fact, how is it valid for God, it is blessed and exalted.The ruling in the presentation of the definition of this case is in its faces: one of them: to see them himself on the patience for it if it is returned, and then it is for that They have after the roses.And the second: that if they know that it will reach them with that time, he will be tired of their fear, and that fear will be hurried to the abuse, so they will be fulfilled.And the third of them: that the infidels, if they see Muhammad and his companions, are based on their debt, and those who are stable with them with the endowment of harm, the murmur, and the humiliation, Rather, choose this religion to cut them in his health, so they invite them to the more reflection in his evidence, and from the knowledge that the one who follows, they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The one in the cause of the gold, which he would support it, then saw it with that insisting on that gold, and that was called for them to follow him from if he saw him It is upon him in that gold.And he pushed it: He is the highest, he told the fate of that way before his fall, and the news of that news was found that he told him about what he told about it, so it was for you.Fifthly: that among the hypocrites is the one who appears to follow the Messenger in order to have the money and the capacity of liveli Opposition; Because the hypocrite, if he hears that, he lids from it and left His religion was in this compassion, this is the most.And its sixth: that the sincerity of the human being is the state of the calamity and its reference to the door of God, the highest of his salvation, if the world is on the authority of the world, so the rule was in this way.The following question: Rather, he said something about the two dimensions, and he did not say things about the collection of Jahin.The first: lest he does not delusion of things from each one, so he will be indicated by the fence of fear, and the ability: with something like that and something like that.The second: it is with a little bit of these things.* * * Fifth question: Know that everything that meets you from its compassion and love, so it is divided into a manner immediately and until it was supplied in the past and to what will be found in the past He risked with you, as it is, as it is called a remembrance and a remembrance, even if it is in the case of the immediate: it is called a stomach and existence, but it is called and found that it is a condition of it.Take a risk of you and the existence of something in the future Fear and agreement, and if it is a lover, it is called, and the conversation is a hope, for the fear is the contemplation of the heart to wait for what is its deceitful, and it is the righteousness of it.What is loved by him, and the hunger is what is intended from it, and it is excused for the sake of the power: the lock - the mercy of God - said: As for the fear of the people, it is the same.The Arabs of the Arabs were causing them, so they did not believe in their intention to them and their meeting with them, and it was from the fear in the part of the parties, what it was, he said: The believers, and the righteousness of a severe earthquake [Al -Ahzab: 11].The stone is on his stomach, and Abu al -Haytham narrated the son of Al -Tahhan, “He - peace be upon him - when he went out of the ritual with my father, Bakr, he said: What is your way out?” He said: He said: He said: He said: The deficiency in the money and the same is that this is the time of the enemy that the human being spends his money in the accommodation of the stress and may be killed.And the soul, and God Almighty said: And guide your money and yourselves [Repentance: 41] And hunger may get the travel of jihad at the death of the increase, God Almighty said: Fifth in the path of God [Tawbah: 120] And the deficiency in the soul may be in the dead of some of the brothers and the approaches on what is the interpretation of his saying: and do not kill you [29] We shorten the fruits, so it may be in the background and it may be the kneeling of the destruction of the loss of the work of the stress of the deeds, and this may be by spending on the one who was on the authority of the one who was on the authority Woody, this is the last The words of the lock - may God have mercy on him - Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him -: fear: fear of God, and hunger: the fasting of the month of Ramadan, and the deficiency of the money: Diseases, and from the fruits: the death of the children.* * * Then it is upset when these things mentioned between the sentences of the patients on these things by saying the Almighty: and the good news of the patient: Patience is obligatory for these things if it is above it; Because he knows that all of that is just and judgment, but whoever is not achieved in faith was the same as those who said in it: And from the people who worship God, he will be forbidden And if a temptation is stroke, he turned on his face, the loss of the world and the hereafter [Hajj: 11].To be patient with what his father does from the discipline, and if he did it, he would have been for him, he would have to be safe, but he is fighting, and that is in the servant with the servant with him, with the servant with the servant with him.It is only a ruling and right to disagree with what the worshipers do from injustice.The second question: the speech in (and Bashir) for the Messenger of God ﷺ or for everyone who comes from the evil.The third question: Sheikh Al -Ghazali - may God have mercy on him - said: I know that patience is one of the characteristics of the human being, and that is not conceived in the Bahaim and the angels, but in the Bahas The angels have its fullness, in his two, that the Bahaam was overwhelmed by the desires, and its lusts are not a mind that opposes it, until it is called the stability of that power in the power of the power, As for the angels, they are repeated to the one who is hungry to the civilization of the rabbit, and the approach is the approach Charming what he knows about the presence of the majesty with another soldier, and as for the human being, he was created in the beginning of the boyhood, and a shorter, like the pneumonia, and it is not created in it except for it.To him, then he appears in it the lust of the play, then the marriage of marriage, and the power of the patience has a dirham, as the patience is a phrase for the steadfastness of the changer, (P-138) The fighting between them to oppose their demands, while the majesty is that there is a lust that they call for the request of urgent pleasure, and symptoms of the last house, and the reason for it On the authority of it, and the rest of the spiritual pleasures are required, then if the mind knows that the preoccupation with the request of this urgent pleasure [what is forbidden to him] on the authority of the prayer, to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the right to the prayer The mind is honest and obedient to the preachers of the lust from the work, so that is called the replacement and the prevention of patience, then I know that the patience is beaten.One of them: a religion, so that the hardships are buried with body and steadfastness, and it is either By actually, he used the hard, or with the involvement, such as patience with severe warning and great pain.The second: It is the patience, and it is the prevention of the soul from the requirements of the desire and the applications of the nature, then this warning if it is patient about the lust of the stomach, the custody of the pardon An imprisonment that was disturbed by the people when the people were disturbed by the deceased, which is the patience, then if it is in a misfortune, it is permissible for him to be in the name of the morning And the heart, which is the release of the passion of passion in lifting the sound, and the coercion of the cheek, and the fissure of the jabb, and others, and if it is in the case of wealth, it is called the stroke of the breath and the condition of it is called: the heat.And if it is in a war and a fight, it is called: courageous, and the cheese is opposed to it, even if it is in the shadow of anger and anger, it is called: a dream, and the ripples are destroyed, and if it is in a nap Summit: the capacity of the chest, and it is destroyed by the background and the scarcity of the chest, even if it is in hiding the words called: the soul of the soul and the name of its owner is called: if it is a dead, and if it is a domain, if it is a dead Zohd, and the ritual is destroyed, and if it is destined to make money called the mask and the evil is contradictory, and God has gathered the highest sections of that and the name of all of the people of God said: [Al -Baqarah: 177] That is: the calamity.And the harm, that is: the poverty: when the misery [Al -Baqarah: 177], meaning: the ritual: Those who believed and those who are the righteous [Al -Baqarah: 177].Patience is not to find the human being, nor that this is not distorted because that is not possible, but patience is the lamb of the soul on the leaving of the purity of the sake of the sake of the grief The soul is about to exclude its effects, its owner was patient, and if he appeared to be a eye or a collar, he said - peace be upon him -: Because whoever appears from him in the appearance of what is not with him the patients and then patience, then he is called Salou, which is what must be of what is necessary, the good said: If only They appreciate him, and God knows best.* * * The following question: In the virtue of the patience, God has described the Almighty with descriptions, and the patience mentioned in the Qur’an in a nose and seventy seventy, and he added.He said: We made them imams from them guiding our affairs when they were patient [Al -Sajdah: 24], and he said: The word of your Lord has fulfilled the good of the children Patience for their reward with the best of what they were doing and said: Those are their wages, two times, with what they were patient [Al -Qasas: 54] and he said: Rather, they will be fulfilled by the one who is the good.Except and rewarded it, except for patience, and for the sake of the fast of the fast, the Almighty said: (The fasting is for me), so he added it to its soul, and the patient is with them And he said: Be patient, that God is with the patient [Al -Anfal: 46] and the victory commented on the patience, and he said: Blind if you are patient and fear and come to you from your light With five thousand of the angels [Al -Imran: 125] and the two patients gathered things that did not collect them for others, and he said: These are the prayers of them and the Lord of their Lord The guided [Al -Baqarah: 157].As for the news, he said - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -: “Patience is the half of faith” and his determination is that faith does not complete until after leaving what is not empty of sayings, and sins, and the sins, and the sins, and the sins, He is overlooked, so the recipient is left to leave what does not want is patience, which is the half (P-139), so on the necessity of these words, the faith must be all of the patience, but it is not good What may be a custody of the lust, so he does not need it to patience, and it may be contrary to the lust, so he needs in it to the patience, so there is no generosity.Peace be upon him -: “From the best of what you have given to the munitions and the determination of the patience, and whoever is given his luck from them, what he did not have to do with the night and fasting of the day and the day Patience, "and this is the likeness of his saying - peace be upon him -:" The pilgrimage is a definition ".Fifth question: In Bayan that patience is better than the mother of thanks?Sheikh Al -Ghazali - may God have mercy on him - said: The significance of the news is on the authority of the patience is more severe, he said - peace be upon him -: Thank you, the people of the earth, and God will reward him with the part of the complainants, and the patients of the people are patient, and he will say to him: Do you accept that we reward you as this is our reward?He says: Yes, Lord, and God Almighty says: I have been blessed with you, and you gave up, and I have been afflicted, and you are patient, so I will be weakened by the reward, so the reward is so much.His saying - peace be upon him -: “The lighter who complains about the house of the fasting fasting“ ”is a sign of the grace of patience.Because this is mentioned in the presentation of the exaggeration, and it is not obtained unless the likeness of it is the greatest of the arrogance of the like Al -Wathn, “And also narrated that Solomon - peace be upon him - enters paradise after the prophet with four fourths, because he was the king of the companions, Bin Afaf is that we are our wealth, and in the news: the chapters of Heaven are all, except for the door of patience, for it is one of the first and the first of those who enter the people of the righteous and the peace of the peace of God.The sixth question: this verse indicated matters: one of them: that this curse does not have to be punished; Because he is the highest and the believers have been promised by the Messenger and his companions.And the second: that this time, if it compares it, is a high degree in religion.And the third of it: that all of this time is from God, the Almighty, the saying of the ecclesiastical who attribute the diseases and others to something, and the difference of the saying To the happiness and whispers of the curtains.And its lord: It indicates that food does not benefit the youth, and the drinking of water does not benefit irrigation, but all of that is obtained by what God has done to him with this with this.Because his saying: And let us be pleased with the addition of these matters to God Almighty, and the saying of those who said: It is up to God when he created its causes, it is true that this is the saying of this The enemy to the metaphor can only be excused after the fact.
