The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of it: and believe in what I descended as a believer for what is with you, and do not be the first to be disbelieving in it and do not buy my verses a little and for me, so you will be.Know that those who address his saying: and believe that they are the children of Israel, and it is indicated by Jahan: The first: that he is given to his saying: Remember to you: As if it was said: Remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and fulfilled my covenant and believed what I descended.The second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: it is true for what is with you, which indicates that.As for his saying: As I descended in his saying, the strongest is that the Qur’an has two signs: one of them: that he described it with his being, and that is the Qur’an; Because he was upset, he said: The book has revealed to you the right to believe in what is between his hands, and the delegation and the Great (Al -Imran: 3).The second: He described it as a sincerity of the books with them, and that is the Qur’an.Qatada said: What is meant and believed in what I descended from a book and a messenger that you find written in Al -Tawara and Al -Najil.As for his saying: a believer in what is with you, in his interpretation: one of them: that in the Qur’an, Moses and Jesus are true, and that the mortar and the Gospel are true, and that the mosa And the exaggeration of Jesus, peace be upon them, so faith in the Qur’an was certain of faith in the convergence and the Gospel, as if it was said to them: if you want to want And the Gospel, believe in the Qur’an, for faith in it confirms faith in the victim and the Gospel.And the second: that the evil was obtained by Muhammad ﷺ and the Qur’an in Al -Tawara and Al -Najil, as if faith in Muhammad and the Qur’an is a friend of the tenderness, and the ritual of the mourning, And the Qur’an is lying (P-39) for the supplies and the Gospel, and this interpretation is first; Because on the first interpretation, faith does not need Muhammad, peace be upon him.Because it is a jurisprudence as an expert from the universe and the Gospels is a truly that faith does not have to be faithful; As for the second interpretation, the belief in it is obligatory, because it is a mortal and the evangelization, if they are derived from the universe of Muhammad ﷺ honest, for faith in the mourning and the evangelist is the faith of the faith.There is no referral, and it is known that God is exalted, but he mentioned these words to be a pilgrimage to them in the path of faith in Muhammad ﷺ, so you have proven that this is this.And he knows that this second interpretation indicates the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ from two faces: the first: that the testimony of the books of the Prophet, peace be upon them, will only be.The second: He, peace be upon him, told them about their books, and he had no knowledge of that except by the one.As for his saying: And do not be the first of his disbelief in it, then it is the first of those who disbelieved in it or the first of a partner or a jujoine who is disbelieved in it or not every one of you.Then it is a question: The first question: How did they make the first to disbelieve in it He preceded them to infidelity with the Arabs of the Arabs?The answer is from his faces: one of them: that this is a definition that they had to be the first of those who believe in it for their knowledge of it and his description; Because they were preaching to the Muhammad ﷺ and those who were open to those who disbelieved in it, when he was sent, their command was on the contrary; To say: “When he came to them, they did not know, they disbelieved in it.[Al -Baqarah: 89].You are - and you know it is mentioned in Al -Tawarah and Al -Najil - as is the one who does not know it while he is a share of it.Because these were the first of those who disbelieved in the Qur’an from the children of Israel, and if you were a Quraysh, they disbelieved in it before that.That is for their scholars: that is, and do not be the first of your nation as well as your writers; Their disbelief; and that is because they witnessed the miracles indicating it The disbelief of those who did not know only one of the evidences, and the precedent to the infidelity will be the greatest of the sin of those after it; He has to him and his button and the weight of those who did it with it.The other is the way to the boss.From the Jews; The people of the book, and it is like it: I preferred you on the two worlds [Al -Baqarah: 47], meaning my world of their time.In it and return your minds in it.First, and the answer is from the faces: one of them: that it is not in the remembrance of that thing, indicating that what he has prepared with his disagreement.On the authority of their disbelief first and last.The Prophet killed them without the right [Women: 155] that does not indicate the occurrence of the killing of the Prophet in fact.And his saying: Aqeeb of this verse: Do not be bought with my verses, a few, and it does not indicate the perpetrator of that with the many, so, so that we are, but the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The fall of the numbness and the denial of those who read in the books.And its elevation: Al -Mubarrad said: This speech is a speech for a people who have been attached to it before others, and it was said to them: Do not disbelieve in Muhammad You are the first of the infidels; Because this first is due to the more ingredient, and that is because if they preceded the infidelity, then it is that they do not pay them in that unbelieve If they are killed by others in that infidelity, they have the richness of that disbelief and the weight of everyone who disbelieves to the Day of Resurrection, and if he did not take them, they will not be killed by them: One of them: precedent to infidelity.The second: the abundance of it, and there is no doubt that it is a great deficiency, so he said it: and do not be the first disbeliever in it a sign of this meaning.As for his saying: Do not buy a few verses, we have explained us in his saying: Those who have bought the delusion with the guidance [Al -Baqarah: 16], that the wise The repetition, so the fruit is placed in the place of the substitute for something and the compensation for it, then if it is chosen on the reward of God, something from the world, then the one who has made it.Do it.Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: The presidents of the Jews are like the son of the son of Al -Asharf and Ya’i ibn Akhbat and their proverbs were taking from the sake If they followed Muhammad, I would have cut off those gifts, so they insisted on the infidels; Like that of that unimaginable destiny; This is because the world is all, with a few, so that we have been given a few, so we have attributed it to the proportions of the one who is the one who is the one who is the same, then these gifts were in the heart of the heart.To the world, the few are very few, that is, a relative to him to the many that is not intended?And he knew that this forbidding is correct, whether they were in them, or if it was not, but if it was proven that their scholars were taking the bribes on the one It indicates that of the teeth, the words were two people, and as for his saying: I miss you, so he will come close to it from what is presented from his saying: And I want to be fled On the authority of fear, but the meeting is that it is needed for it with the reward by obtaining what is left from it, as if it is up to them with the mind of the sake of the sake of the sake of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a matter Because the punishment is appointed.
