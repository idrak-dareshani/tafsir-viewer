The Quranic researcher (P-123) [Surah Al-Ala] The ninetieth of a ten-sided verse ﷽ Praise the name of your Lord, the highest, who created, and who was destined, and he who was lost, and he who was late ﷽ Praise the name of your Lord, who created, and who was destined to be guided, and who was brought out by the pasture, so he made him a sickness, I know that he said: The first question: In his saying: The name of your Lord is saying: One of them: that what is meant by the name of God is the name and sanctification of God.The second: that the name is a prayer and what is meant by God is transcendent.As for the first face, in the memorizers it is involved.One of it: that what is meant is the name of your Lord, on the authority of his name, so that it is forbidden for that, so that it is forbidden by his name.And the conversion of the merciful of the day.And the second: that his names do not explain what is not valid in his right to their grace, as it is the highest to explain the highest in the place in the place and the sake of the sake With the brightness, stability, and leveling of the seizure.And the third: to be concerned about the vulnerability and the male, not on the face of reverence and glossary, and enter it in it to remember these names with the ignorance and the soul And its facts.And the one that is: that what is meant is the praise of your Lord, that is, his gloriousness with his names that I have revealed to you and introduced you to his names as the saying of God: [Al -Israa: 110] And the counterpart of this interpretation is the words of the Almighty: He praised the name of your great Lord [the incident: 74], and the words of the words of this are the one: That is, pray in the name of your Lord, not as the participants pray with the blessing and confrontation.And the second: that the servant does not mention his Lord except with the names that he responded to the eagerness, the female said: There is no difference between the name of your Lord and the one who said: Because the meaning (praise in the name of your Lord), God bless him with the remembrance of his name, which is mentioned by his eagerness and his highness, when he says the one who is the one who is the one who is blessed, (P-124) of the bad and fifth: Abu Muslim said: What is meant is from the name here is the row, and so in his saying, the Almighty: God has the good names, so let him call it [180] The name will be a link and the meaning be the praise of your Lord, and he is the choice of a group of those who investigate.It is obligatory in God Almighty, but the reminder, if he is in the end of the bone, is not mentioned, but his name is mentioned, and it is said: He praised his name, and he praised his remembrance, as he said, as he said: Labid said: ؎ To the day, then the name of peace is upon you, that is, peace, and this is a famous way in the language, and we say On this way: the praise of God is the one who is destroyed by two people: the first: that the disbelievers are not treated by a treatment that is presented with the reason for the remembrance of God, and it is not what he said: They pray without God, and they will cause God to be an enemy without knowledge [Al -Anam: 108].The second: It is a reflection of God, which is attributed to all that is not fit for it, in itself, in its attributes and in its actions, and in its names and in its rulings, but in itself, it is that it is not.And symptoms, but in his attributes, he is not able to be updated, nor is it dead, or incomplete, and in his actions, he is not able to do so that he is a money that is absolute, so there is no money, so there is no reason It is upon him in a matter of things, and the disgrace said: It is that he believes that everything that he did is good and good, and that he does not do the ugly and does not accept it, and he is not satisfied with it, Except with the names that he responded to the eagerness, this is at us, and as for the dismissed, it is that it is not mentioned except with the names that are not deluded by the lack of it.Or he did not respond, but in his rulings, he knows that he did not have any of us to benefit.Rather, either for the sake of money on what is our saying, or the pursuit of the reconciliation of worshipers on what [is] the saying of the disgrace.* * * The conflict, so there must be from Bayan that the name is what is and the name is what is until we can go into the name, is it the soul of the name or not, then we say: If it is from the name Recruitment, and with the name of those self, the sane can not say: The name is the soul of the name, is that that self is the same self, and this cannot be disputed in it a sane person, so we know that this question is in and described it.And if it was like that, the row was in the remembrance of the reciprocate, and he walked up, but there is an accuracy, which is that our saying: a name is a word that we have made a name for a name.It is associated with a time, and the name is like that.The late people, and they thought that the name is in all the places the same name, this is the achievement of investigations in this question, and let us return to the words of the word, who said: The name is the soul of the name that no one does not say the name of God and the grace of the name of our Lord, so the meaning of the name of your Lord praised your Lord, and the Lord is the name To be praised by him, and know that this recipient is weak When we have indicated in the first question that it is possible that the matter can be and respond to the praise of the name, and it is possible that what is meant is the praise of the name and the remembrance of the name.It is possible that what is meant is praising the name of your Lord as it is said: Praise the name of your great Lord, and the meaning is praise your Lord with the remembrance of his names.(P-125) The third question: It was narrated from Aqabah ibn Amir, “When he said:“ So praise the great Lord of your Lord, he said to us.” Your knees, “And when he said:“ Praise the name of your Lord, he said: “Make it in your prostration.“ Then it was narrated in the news.The great “and in his prostration:“ Glory be to my Lord the highest.This involvement is confirmed by the soil of the informants that his saying is exalted: Glory be to God when you touch and when they become [Al -Rum: 17] The following question: Read on him, peace be upon him and Ibn Omar: It must be mentioned that praise, and it is only his saying: Glory be to my Lord.The fifth question: the embodiment of the exaltation of the highness of the place by saying: Your Lord is the highest and the truth is that the highest on the authority of God is the Almighty, for the exaltation of God.Or it is not deadly, if it was dead, it was his sophisticated parties, and it was by one side, then it would not be his charity higher than all the things, and if it is not, then if it is, then if it is.With the existence of a domesticated dimension, it is also referred to it, because if it is not dead from all the flaws, it is necessary that the same is the exalted, and the exaltation of the exaltation, and the exaltation of the exalted It is died from some of the flaws and was eaten from some of the flaws.The existence of its own is possible, and this is referred.It was proven that the highness is not in the sense of the high on the one hand, which confirms that that what before this verse and what then contradicts that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is what is The verse is because the high is a expressive of its universe in the end of the world, and this does not suit the investigations of praise, praise and glorification, but the highest is the same By creativity and creativity, it is appropriate for that, and the surah is a reminder to the exemption and its description of the Almighty with what is for the sake of which it deserves the praise, the blessing, and the sake of this Because he added his saying: (the highest) by saying: He who created, and the Creator is appropriate for the highest [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection
