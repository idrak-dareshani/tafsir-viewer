The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, and if you came to those who gave the book with every verse that you followed before you Their whims of what came to you from science, so that you are among those who are unjust, know that it is up to what was shown in the first verse that those who have given the book know that this is the right After that, their class does not change in the continuation of the stubbornness, and in the verse: (P-113) the first question: they disagreed with the saying of it: The book is the deaf: What is meant by their sciences who have informed God of them in the verse presented with his saying: And those who have given the book to know that the right is to know On him with Jajah: One of them: His saying: And if you follow their whims, and describe them that they follow the passion, and whoever is hidden in the falsehood is that there is no truth, there is no truth The soul is, but it is in his thinking that it is followed by the guidance, but those who know their hearts, then they deny their tongue, then they are the one.And the second: that what is before this verse and it is his saying: that those who have given the book to know that the truth does not take over their inhabitants, but it is a disobedient, and it is not the same, and it is not.Those who have come to the book, they know it as they know their children [Al -Baqarah: 146] is specialized in the scholars as well, as if it was general in everyone who prevented the killing; Because the great gathering is not permissible for them, and if what is before it and what is after it is special, then this is the intermediate verse.And the third of it: that God has informed them that they are Egypt, they are their saying, and they are diluted with their falsehood, and that they do not return from that This is the case of the broke, not the confusing stubbornness.And he paired it: If we had carried it on the general, the verse would have been lying; Because many of the people of the book believed in Muhammad ﷺ and followed his acceptance.Others said: Rather, all the people of the book are from the Jews and the Christians, and they needed it that his saying: Those who have given the book the form of a general, then they will be the same The first is that the owner of the suspicion is the owner of the truth; Because it does not complete the view and the reciprocate, then if he came with the perfection of the view and the recipient, he would reach the truth, so where he did not reach the knowledge that he has taught us to know The passion, and they answered about the second Hajj that it is not forbidden to be wanted in the first verse, and in all the second verse, and they answered about the three pilgrims that they were the one who was the third The young people, and the people were Egyptians to follow these scholars, the righteous were to have all, and they answered the fourth of the pilgrim They do not believe in their entirety, and our saying: All Jews do not believe in the struggles of our saying that one of them does not believe.The second question: Al -Kaabi brought this verse on the permissibility of being in the place of a kind of one for them, he said: Because he is in the place of God Frequently, in the sentence of verses, if they had not given them, they would not believe, so this news was not correct on the face of the piece.The third question: The father of a Muslim brought this verse that the knowledge of God is exalted in His worshipers and what they do is not with a pilgrimage to them, so they will be in the face of them Because they do the good that they commanded and left against it, who were forbidden, and our companions took our companions on the saying of the one who is not unbearable, and it is not unbearable They followed his kisses, and if they followed his kisses, he would have been transferred to the news of God.It is referred to, and they were commanded by it, so they were commanded by the transfer, and the saying in it is mentioned in his saying, the Almighty: that those who disbelieved themselves with them are not for them.They believe [Al -Baqarah: 6].The following question: Rather, God is the ruling on them that they do not refer to their falsehoods by the reason It removes it with the revenue of the argument, but it is the manifestation of the persistence, the stubbornness, and the envy, and that is not removed by the indication of the evidence.The fifth question: they disagreed with his saying: What you followed before you said good, and the Jubayi: He wanted all of them, as if he said: They do not gather on the authority of you His saying: And if God wills, he would collect them on the guidance [Al-Anam: 35] and he said (p-114) and others: Rather, it is intended that one of them does not believe, the judge said: If I want the family And the misery, then it is imperative to be interpreted from goodness, and if the scholars want it, we look at it, if in their scholars who address this verse, whoever is safe for you, whoever is safe for you It is in them who has believed his proof of his appearance in the return of negation to each of them; Because that is the most promising, as there is no difference between his saying: what you followed by your kiss and between his saying: what you followed before you.The sixth question: (either) in the sense of (if) and answered with the answer “if” and the scholars have a disagreement, so it was said: They are not the one who does not do so And he answered his answer, his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: And when we sent a wind [Al -Rum: 51] Then he said: (Look) at the answer: He said: For a representative at an answer: (yen), and that is that the origin of (if) for the past (and now) for the one who is accepted, this is the saying of the fear, and he said: Its position, but the right to the answer is this The interference of the pain of the mother in the sense of the division, the answer came as the answer to the division.The seven question: the verse: its weight is a verb that is originally: none, so they disgrace the tension in the verse, so they reply from the first yaa, a thousand to open what is before it And the mark, and the man of the man: his person, and the people came out with their gathering, and the verse of the Qur’an was called with that; Because it is a group of forensic.It was said: Because it is a mark for the objection of the words that after it.It was said: Because it is indicative of its obstruction from the creatures, and that it is only from the words of God Almighty.The eighth question: It was narrated that the city is exhausted and the Christians of Najran said to the Messenger ﷺ: We come to us with a verse as the prophet came before you, so God is the best of God This verse is what came down in a premature occurrence, but rather from the rest of the rulings of the kiss.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: What you follow before them, in it, he said: The first: that it is a payment of the permissibility of copying, and that this is the kiss.And the second: a good deeds of the people of the book, then they said: If you were proven before us, we would be hoped that we would be our friend who we are waiting for, and they are in the way of it.They kissed them.The third: The interview means what they are in their void, and what you are in your right.The lord: He wanted that he does not have to communicate with them to follow their kisses; Because this is disobedience.Fifth: You are not a pretext before all the people of the book from Jews and Christians; Because the kissing of the Jews is contrary to the kiss of the Christians, for the Jews of the Mqs al -Muqdis and the Levantine Christians, then the time before you and let their sayings.As for his saying: And some of them are followed by some of the locks.On one kiss until they can be satisfied with it.The second: that the Jews and the Christians are with their agreement on your denying you, who are in the kiss, so how do they invite you to leave you before you with what they are in between.The third: This is the heroes of their saying that it is not permissible to violate the people of the book; Because, if it is permissible to disagree with them for the reconciliation, it is permissible for the reconciliation to be in the third, and the carrying of the verse is on the authority of the ritual, and it is in the past Some of them followed before some of them denied that one of them has followed before the other before the other Their scholars who were in that time, and we did not prove that (P-115) is one of them followed the kissing of the other Entering his specialization.* * * As for his saying: And if you follow their whims, they have two questions: the first question: the short passion is what tends to the nature, and the air, The stretch is known.The second question: They disagreed with the addressee of this speech, some of them said: The Messenger, and some of them said: The Messenger and others.Others said: Rather, it is not.Because he knew that the Messenger does not do that, it is not permissible to be specialized in this speech, and this third saying is a mistake; Because everything that was signed from the Messenger is ugly, and the abandonment of it is a high If all that God knew was that he would not do it, he would not be forbidden from him, if he knew that he would do it, he must not command him with him, and this is not.With something and not from something, and that it is void.And the second: If not for the forbidden and warning would not be presented, the Prophet ﷺ was raised from it, so when that is the premise of that, the forbidden and the warning, then the warning, so In contrast to the end and warning.And the third of it: that the supply is from the forbidden and the return to make sure of that in the mind, so the abuse of it will be the affirmation, and when it is good from the kind of God, the kind of God is the same The indication of the neutrality, then it was decided in the minds, and the abuse of it is sure of the mind in the transmission, so any dimension in the same way is this.And in the first place: His exalted say in the right of angels: Whoever says from them is that I am a god without it, so we will reward him for Hell.They fear their Lord from their authority and do what they command [Al -Nahl: 50] and he said in the right of Muhammad ﷺ: If you are part, you will not be your work [Al -Zumar: 65] And peace - what is perceived and what he did to him, and he said: Oh, the Prophet, fear God and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites [Al -Ahzab: 1] and he said: “If you do not understand,” To you from your Lord, and if you do not do, then what you have reached his message [Al -Ma’idah: 67] and his saying: And do not be among the participants [Al -Anam: 14], so you have stated that he is the one who mentioned - That is, and that it is also forbidden from him; Because the forbidden from these things is not one of the properties of the Messenger - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -, it is necessary to say: So did he summarize him without him?So we say in it the faces: one of them: that everyone who was blessed with God was more than the blessing of God, and the ritual of sins were hurt, and there is no doubt that the blessings of God be upon him - the blessings of God be upon him - More, then the crops of sins were hurt, so it was the first to be specialized.And the second: that the more love requires specialization with the more warning.And the third of it: that the firm man, if he accepts his greatest and reconciliation, will be rewarded for an order in the presence of a group of his children, so he will be with you.The verb is that they choose and commit it, and in the usual people to direct their command and forbid them to whom he is the greatest of the arrogance that you alert This verse.The second saying: that his saying: And if you follow their whims, it is not intended from him that he followed their whims in all matters, so perhaps - may God bless him and grant him peace Their whims, like the launch of the deceitful in the saying and the rudeness in the words, (p -116) in the way of it - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - in their dusty, then God is the Almighty, In the kidney on what he said: If not for you, you would have left them a little bit [Al -Israa: 74].The third saying: The public speaking, even if it is with the Messenger, except that what is meant by him is otherwise, and this is that if you are blamed a human being, his servant offends to your servant, then he will say: Once again, like this action, I have punished you with a severe punishment, so the abuse of it was not inclined to address their address and follow themselves.* * * As for his words, he said: From what came to you from the science, there are two issues: the first question: that it is upset, and he did not want the soul of the knowledge, but the soul came to you, but the soul came to you.And miracles; Because that is from the style of science, then this is in the matter of release the name of the effect on the influence, and he knows that the abuse of the boss is the exaggeration and the exaltation, as if it is the exaggeration, and the exalted The greatness of the prophecies and miracles that he called them the name of science, and that is alert you to the fact that science is the greatest of the creatures, honorable and arrogant.* * * The second question: The verse indicated that the return is directed to the scholars more than its direction, other than them, because he said: from what you have said.As for his saying, “You are among the unjust, what is meant, if you did, then you would have been in the house And the imprisonment, and God knows.
