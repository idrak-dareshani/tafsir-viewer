The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And among the people who likes you, his saying in the worldly life, and God is witnessing what is in his heart, and he is the one who is the oppression Herithm and the hypocrisy, and God does not love corruption.They testify the feelings of the pilgrimage, two of the pilgrims: a disbeliever, and he who says: Our Lord is coming in the world and a Muslim, and he is the one who says: Our Lord brings us in the world, good, and in the last of the other [201] The remainder of the argument, so he mentioned it in this verse, and explained his attributes and his acts, so this is what is related to the purpose of the verse, and the suppression of all of that is the goodness While it is connected to the actions of the hearts and the wounds, and that they know that the servants cannot hide things from it.Then the (P-168) was assigned to those who say that two of them said: This verse is specialized with certain sizes, and among them who said: It is a general in the right The recipe is mentioned in this verse, but the first people have disagreed with faces: the first narrator: that it came down in the Akhans ibn Shariq al -Thaqafi He accepted the Prophet ﷺ and the Islam appeared, and he claimed that he loves him and is solved by God on that, and this is what is meant by his saying: He will see you in the saying What is in his heart is not that he was a hypocrisy, the good of the hedge of the interior, then he came out from the Prophet, peace be upon him, and passed by a group of people from the one He killed the red, and he is intended to say: If he takes over, he will seek the ground to spoil in it, and he will be hidden and the hypocrisy and he said: The one who wants to say: Al -Akhnas indicated to the children of Zahra with a day, and he said to them: Muhammad is the son of your sister They said: Yes, the opinion is what you saw, he said: If we want in people with the merciful, then I will be betrayed by you, so follow me, then he gave me a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from a man from the man ﷺ, and he called this captivity, and his name was Abi Bin Shariq, so he informed that Messenger The verb does not respond to the defamation, and the saying of the Almighty: And among the people who admire you, his saying in the life of the worldly life, and God is witnessing what is in his heart in the heart of the It can be carried on him, but the first saying is the most correct.And the second novel: In the reason for the descent of this verse, what was narrated from Ibn Abbas and the laughter that the disbelievers of Quraysh were sent to the Prophet ﷺ that we have become Muslim Your companions, so he sent them a group, so they went down With the dignity of the ritual, and the news was reached to the infidels, so they rode seventy of them, and they surrounded them and killed them and crucified them, so they came to them, and this is the same The remembrance of those who seek himself to abubble the pleasure of God, alerted to that in the event of these martyrs.The second saying: In the verse, which is the choice of the most investigators from the interpreters, that this verse is general in the right of everyone who was described by this, and the one who has the adjectives Muhammad ibn Kaab al -Qarashi, that he was running between him and between other words in this verse.It is general in every person who was described by those characteristics, and investigating the question that his saying: It is from people a sign of some of them, and he will be imprisoned, and the one is destroyed, And his saying: God is witnessing that it does not indicate that what is meant by him is one of the people to return to that to the word without the meaning while it is a collection, and it is a whole, and it is the one We told him, so it is not forbidden from the general, but we say: It has what is indicated by the general, and it is one of the faces: one of them: that the ruling is arranged on the description of the right to the one who is the one who does God Almighty has a people and described them with adjectives that require the fulfillment of the defamation, and we know that the obligatory for those who are lying is that of those attributes, so it is necessary that all of the adversaries was that of all the adjectives.To be a fan of the vilification.And the second: that the bearing is more accurate, and that is because it is a mine for all the costs of that slander.And the third: that this is close to the point; Because if we carry the verse on the general, then he enters that person, and if we specialize in that person, the judgment does not prove the judgment other than him; So you have proven what we mentioned that carrying the verse on the general one, if you know this, then say: They disagreed that the verse is indicated that the description of the ritual is not.That it does not indicate that, because God is exalted and described this masculine with five attributes, and something of them does not indicate hypocrisy; The first of it is his saying: His saying in the life of the world, and this is not (P-169) a sign of it in a row of defamation except from the destination of the gesture that is the one who says: Because the human being, if it is said: He is the solution of speech, while it is related to the world or the illusion of the validity of the slander.And the second: His saying: God is witnessing what is in his heart, and this is not a sign in it in a disguised state, so if we have guaranteed it in it, God will witness what is in the heart of God That is, the words are with this guarantee that does not indicate hypocrisy; Because it is not in the verse that the one who shows it to the Messenger is from the matter of Islam and the Judaism, for it is that it guarantees its disagreement until it is necessary that it is a hypocrite, but it is a perpetrator, but it is a perpetrator, but it is a perpetrator, but it is a distance.Corruption and appears It is against it to be a mide.And the third of it: its saying: It is the symmetry, and this also does not require hypocrisy.And his booster: His saying: If he takes over, he will seek the ground to spoil in it and the Muslim who is spoiled, may be like that.Fifth: His saying: And if he is said to him, he will fear God, the pride took him with ourselves, then this also does not require hypocrisy, so we know that all of this is the one who is in the hands It is proven in the hypocrisy, it can be proven in the context, so that there is no significance in the verse that this reminder must be an agreed one, except that the hypocrisy is within, and that the hypocris Every hypocrisy is that it is a wool with this fifth characteristics, but it may be the fast with this fifth attributes, so that it is not a hypocris Sufism with this fifth adjectives in which the hypocrisy and the districts entered, and if you know this sentence, then say: God is the Almighty and described this one with the righteousness: His saying: His saying in the worldly life and the meaning: it will be glorified and glorified in your heart and the strange thing that is glorified in the breath.As for his saying: In the life of the world, it is in its faces: one of them: it is a counterpart of the saying of the saying: the words of so -and -so in this question and the meaning: And his words when he speaks to the demand of the world.The second: that the estimation is: its saying and its words in the life of the world, even if it does not like it, its saying and its words in the hereafter because it is as long as it is as long as it is as long as it is in the world.The sweetness of the words, and in the hereafter, it is the same as the king and the confusion of fear of God, and the abundance of his arrogance.The second line: His saying: God is witnessing what is in his heart.Cursing with the caliph and right, and it is necessary for it to be that he says: God will testify that the matter is as I said, so this will be a guidance, and there is no guidance, and there is no guidance, and no They read and testify God to the light of the ya, that is, this saying, God is witnessing what is in his guarantee, and the son of Muhsin reads, “God will testify to what is in the heart of God.” He knows whoever turns his hearts.The first reader: it indicates his being a martial and on the authority that God witnesses falsehood and his purity.As for the second reader: it is not indicated only as a liar.The third adjective: the saying of the Almighty: It is the symmetry, and it contains issues: the first question: the children: the hardness of the special, it is said: a man of the father, and the people of God, and the people of God, and the people of God, and the people of God, And the people are warned about it [Maryam: 97] and it is like it: Rather, they are the people who are special [Al -Zakhrf: 58] It is said: From it, he would give birth, with the opening of the mother in a verb from it, then it is a lion, if it is a characteristic, and I gave the man to his father, with the sake of the mother, if he dominated the mother, if he dominates the lame, if he dominated him.I derive it from the neck of the neck, and they are his pity, and the valley of the valley, and they are his side, and his interpretation is that in any face that his deaf took from Yumin (P-170) He dominated his own.As for the symmetry, it is the saying of one of them: It is the saying of the caliph that it is a source in the sense of the commanding, such as fragmentation and taste in the sense of fighting and the obedience, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, and it is Then in this addition and Jahan: one of them: it is in the sense of “in” and appreciation: the one in the symptom.The second: He made the symptoms to the path of the exaggeration.And the second saying: that the symptoms are a collection of a symmetry, as difficulties and difficulty, and huge and amazing, and the meaning: It is the most severe of the characteristics, and this is the saying of the gospel, he said: I descended in Al -Akhnas Bin Shareq on what we explained: in which we have also said: Woe to all of the prodigy [Al -Hamza: 1] and his saying: Do not obey all We walked in Nemim [Pen: 11] Then for the interpretations, expressions of the interpretation of this word, the Mujahid al -Khasam said: a student who does not stand up, and he said: Al -Khumaq, and Qutdah said: The symptoms are based on that it is a slave of falsehood.* * * Delivery, otherwise it is permissible for that; And his answer is what was presented in his saying: There is no evidence in the pilgrimage [Al -Baqara: 197].The righteous adjective: His exalted say: If he takes over, he will seek the ground to spoil in it and the plow and the human being will be destroy The solution of the words, and that he decides the truth of his saying with the righteousness of God and that he is the righteousness That was said: And if he takes over, he will seek the ground to spoil in it, then in the verse, the questions: When you seek the ground with corruption, then this corruption leads to two sides: one of them: what was from the contradiction of the money with the absence, the burning, and the rituals, and on the authority The betrayal when he appeared to the Messenger, peace be upon him, that he loves him and that he is determined to believe, so when he came out of him, he passed by the power He killed the red, and from it that when he was scattered from a bird, he passed through the sons of Zahra and was between him and between the thorns Their livestock and burn their cultivation.And the second face in the interpretation of corruption: that after the victory of the Prophet, peace be upon him, he was seen in the ange of the similarity in the hearts of the Muslim, and the slave of the Muslim Strengthening the infidels, and this meaning is called a corruption, he said a story about the people of Pharaoh, where they said to him: Moses and his people will be unknown to God, that is: Your people from their religion, and spoil them with their project, and he also said: I am afraid that your debt will be replaced or that it will appear in the land of corruption [Ghaffir: 26] His Excellency said: And if they are said to them, do not spoil the earth [the cow: 11] What is close to this direction, but this meaning was called a corruption in the land because it is the one They separate their words and lead to some of them And cut your wombs [Muhammad: 22], so tell that if they took away from his religion, they only obtained corruption in (P-171) the earth, and cut off the arrival, Many in the Qur’an, and know that the carcass was carried on this, the first of his pregnancy on the offense and the deeds, because it is upholstered, he said: He will be exhausted by the plow, the lord, and the one He has no referral.The second saying: In the interpretation of his saying: And if he takes care, and if he becomes and to me, he will do what the bad state does from corruption in the land with the height of the plow and the lord, and it is said: God is forbidden by the grims of his dirt, so that the hierarchy and the wretched, and the first saying is close to the verse, because the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Goodness and love appears, and when the absence seeks to rhythm of temptation and corruption.The second question: His saying: He sought in the land, that is, strive to rhythm, and the origin of the pursuit is walk It is said: So, so that he will seek the name, God Almighty said: If they came out in you, they would only increase you, and they will put you through you The third question: Whoever interprets corruption with the oath, he said: He is the highest of his first remembrance of the way of the busts, and he said: to spoil it, then mention it, then mention it, then mention it, then mention it.And he said: The plow and the hypocrisy are destroyed, and whoever interprets the corruption with the liking of the suspicion, he said: As the true religion is two things; The first of them is the knowledge, and the second is the work, so the false religion is the first of whom are the youth, and the second is the verb of the ancients, for it is the first of the highest, and it is the first of that What is meant by his saying: to spoil in it, then mention his feet on the ancients, and it is what is meant by saying it: and he will destroy the pill The interpretation is first and then whoever said: Because we descend the verse that the elderly passed by a cultivation of the Muslims, so he burned the cultivation and killed the red, he said: That redness, and the plow is what the agriculture is from.وقِيلَ: إنَّ الحَرْثَ هو شَقُّ الأرْضِ, ويُقالُ لِما يُشَقُّ بِهِ: مِحْرَثٌ, وأمّا النَّسْلُ فَهو عَلى هَذا التَّفْسِيرِ نَسْلُ الدَّوابِّ, والنَّسْلُ في اللُّغَةِ: الوَلَدُ, واشْتِقاقُهُ يَحْتَمِلُ أنْ It will be from their saying: He wore it if he came out and fell, and from it, the feathers of the bird, and the camel spread, and the hair, if it comes out, then it was broken.Nahla, and from it the Almighty saying: to their Lord, they will be forgotten [Yass: 51], that is, they will speed up, because he worsened the exit with one one, and the birth of the father is from the father of the father And his stamps, and the people are the descendants of Adam, and the origin of the letters of the tissue is the ruler, and the one who said: The reason for the revelation of the verse is that the elderly came to the people of the people of the people, What is meant by plowing: either the elevation of the saying of the Almighty: your misfortune is a plow for you [the cow: 223] or the men, and it is the saying of the people of the people who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The earth, as the men are those who make the land of birth, and the descendants are what is meant by the two boys.And know that it is on all the faces, so what is meant is that that corruption is a great corruption that is not greater than it; Because what is meant by the first interpretation is the inhabitants of the plant and the animal, and on the second interpretation of the wake of the time with its origin and its branch, and on the face of the two of it, then it is not.His saying: The plow and the hypocrisy are from the eloquent, very shouting, with its seduction of the many genius, and its counterpart in the predecessor, what he said in what he said in what he said.The soul is crafted and the eyes are delighted [Al -Zakarf: 71] and he said: Its water was removed from it and its water [Al -Naafarah: 31].(P-172) It is said: The verse is condemned by the fact that it is perceived by the plow and the hypocrisy, or it indicates that he wanted that?We said: His saying: He sought in the land to spoil in it, indicating that he was overwhelmed to seek in this The verse is on the authority of that.The first, indicate that the first, and the first, and if the news is mentioned in the reason for the revelation of the verse indicated that these things were made and entered.The following question: He read each of them, “He gave up the plow and the wonder” that the verb is for the plow and the generation, and the good read the openness of the mother of the mother of you He refuses, and it was narrated from him.On the construction of the verb.* * * The fifth question: the disgraceful of the righteousness is that God does not want the doves with the saying of the Almighty: God does not love corruption, they said: and love for the sake He said to him, the Almighty: Those who love the obscenity of the obscenity [Al -Nur: 19] and what is meant by that is that they want, and also that it is transmitted from the Messenger of the Messenger.I love you three, and repeat it for you three, I love you to worship it and do not share anything with it, and to advise from your guardians, and repeat it to you, the money and the saying, He would make hatred against love, and if only love is a refrain from the will, otherwise it would have been against the will, and if it was, if the love would be, the love is not.The verb, even if it is his hatred; Because his hatred is on this saying, but it is contrary to the will without love, they said: And if it is proven that love is the same will, then his saying: God does not love the corruption He does not want corruption as his saying: And God does not want injustice to worshipers [Ghaffir: 31], but the significance of this verse is stronger because it is the highest of what he said of the corruption Corruption does not love a sign of it; It was indicated that that occurrence was not in the will of God, and if it is proven that he is an exalted, he does not want corruption, he must not be an immortal for him; Because creation can only be with the will, so this verse is indicative of the will of the will and the question of the creation of the verbs.And the companions answered him with two Jahin: The first: that love is not the will, but the love is a phrase for the praise of the thing and the male of its glorification.The second: If we are peaceful that love is the same will, but his saying: God does not love corruption and does not benefit the general because the thousand and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not say The power of this speech is guided by the first: the first: that the ability of the servant and his good deeds is good for salvation and corruption; So corruption is suggested to the righteousness, if it is not for a cause, then the denial of the chains is required, and if it is likely to be likely, then the most likely, it is necessary, and it must be from the Single, so it was proven that God is the most likely to be the corruption of corruption on the side of the righteousness, so how is it reasonable to say: He does not want it.The second: He is a scholar of corruption, for if corruption does not fall, it is necessary to say: He wanted to kill the knowledge of itself, ignorance.The fifth adjective: His exalted said: If it is said to him that God fears him, the pride took him with lying in and in which there are questions: the first question: The one said: The one said: The pride took him with the fact that the Messenger of God called him to leave these actions, so the oldest and nose called him to injustice.Know that this interpretation is weak, because his saying: If it is said [Translation failed: Request exception can happen
