The third story researcher: It is also indicative of the validity of the resurrection: And when Abraham said, the Lord of my Lord, how to live the dead, he said, “Do not believe in me, and he said: So take four of the birds, and they will be blessed to you, then make every mountain of them a part, then let them come to you, and I know that God is the best of God.And when Abraham said, the Lord of Arna, how to revive the dead, he said: I did not believe, he said, but to reassure my heart, he said: He takes four of the good, so the good is for you.From them a part, then let them come to you, and I know that God is dear wise in the verse.When Abraham said, and others said: He is kind to his saying: Did you not see the pilgrim, who did not see when you did not see, as I needed his Lord in his Lord, and I did not see when he said, when he said: Motti.The second question: that he was not called Azir when he said: Or, as he passed through a village and he was called, we are wicked with that the one who is the search is in the seat in all of the seat, The reason is that a misery did not memorize the literature, but he said: He said that this God revives after its death and its innocent Where he said: (Arna), and also that Abraham, when he took into account the literature, made life and death in the good, and he was unaware of what the literature did not take into account, making life and death in its soul.(P-34) The third question: They mentioned the question of Abraham Wahwah: The first: Al-Hasan, Al-Lahhak, Qutdah, Ata, and Ibn Jarraj said: If the sea is extended, the animals of the sea will be eaten, and if the sea comes, the predecessor will be eaten, and if the predecessor went, the bird comes, then it was eaten, and it was rage, so he said, and he said: The parts of the animal are collected from the stomachs of the predecessor, the eloquent and the animals of the sea, so it was said: Did you not believe?He said: Yes, but it is required from the question that the science becomes a fierceness.The second face: Muhammad ibn Ishaq and the judge said: The question is that it is with his debate with our argument when he said: My Lord who revives and dies, he said: A loved one and killed a man, Abraham said: This is not with life and death, and when he said: Lord, I will give you how to live the dead to reveal this And follow it, and it was narrated from Nimon that he said: Say to your Lord until he revives, otherwise I will kill you, so God Almighty asked that, and he said: “To reassure me.To reassure my heart with the power of my Hajj and Barahan, and that my entirety from it to otherwise was not because of the weakness of that Hajj, but it was the reason for the ignorance of the one.The third face: Ibn Abbas said And Saeed bin Jabir and Al -Saddi, may God be pleased with them: God Almighty revealed to him that I am a good human beings.So, Abraham ﷺ and said: What are the signs of that?He said: His mark is that he revives the dead with his supplications, so when he dreamed of the abode of peace be upon him, peace be upon him in the grades of Abboudia and the performance of the message.Al -Khalil, he asked the neighborhood of the dead, and God said: I did not believe, he said, but I will reassure my heart on that I am a successor for you.The loud face: that ﷺ he asked that for his people, and that is that the followers of the Prophet were calling them with the things of a void and a right, like a righteous, like a righteous, like a righteous, like a righteous, like a righteous, like a right Peace: Make us a god as the gods have the people [Al -A'raf: 138] and I will ask Ibrahim.What is meant is to witness it, and the denial of their hearts will be removed.The Fifth face: What was dangerous with Babi, I said: There is no doubt that the nation is as they need in the knowledge that the Messenger is true to claim the miracle to a miracle that appears to be the one who appears to be When the king’s prayer is to him and his people, he is that God sent him a Messenger who needs a miracle that appears on the hand of that king to know that the Messenger knows that the Messenger is not.Satan is a dominant, and so if the king hears the words of God, he needed a miracle that indicates that that words are the words of God, and there is no words of others, and if it is like that The king is to Abraham and told him that God Almighty sent you a messenger to the creation.On the one that the next king is a generous king, not a dominant Satan.The sixth face, which is on the authority of the people of Sufism: that what is meant is from the hearts of the arguments that are the lights of the revelations and the manifestation, and the gesture is a phrase for the sake of that Divine, his saying: I see how to live the death of a request for that manifestation and disclosures, so he said: Did you not believe?He said: I believe in the faith of the unseen, but I ask her to collect it to reassure my heart with the causes of that manifestation.And according to the words of the two speakers: the knowledge is what is broken to (P-35), suspicions and suspicions, so he demanded a warning knowledge that does not restrict the heart of the heart.Something is made of doubts and youth.The following face: Perhaps he seemed in the newspapers that God Almighty has revealed to him that he will be honored by his son Jesus that he revives the dead with his prayers, so he is a good man.I want, but my heart will reassure me that I am not less hose in your presence than my son Jesus.The eighth face: that Abraham ﷺ was commanded to make the boy’s sacrifice, and he hurried to him, then he said: I commanded me to make a spirit without a spirit, so I did, and I ask you, and I will ask you.He said: Did you not believe?He said: My heart is to reassure my heart on that you took me as a successor.The ninth face: Abraham ﷺ in his heart, he saw him dead with the love of his son, so he was briefed from God and said: I see how you will live in the dead, meaning: His life will be the remembrance of God Almighty.The tenth face: the estimation of the verse is that all creation see the day of the day of resurrection, so I see that in the world, so he said: Did you not believe?He said: I am, but my heart reassures me to allocate me in the world with the increase of this supervision.The sharp face was ten: the intention of Abraham was not the neighborhood of the dead, but his intention was to hear the words without mediation.The second is twenty: What a people said of ignorance, which is that Abraham ﷺ was a complaint in the predecessor's knowledge and in the knowledge of the re -re - [Al -Anam: 78] And his saying: If my Lord does not guide me, I am from the lost people [Al -Anam: 77].Infidelity; and that is because the ignorance is the power of God, the Almighty is the neighborhood And what is indicated by the corruption of that is the face of it: one of them: the Almighty said: I did not believe in my mind, but he would reassure my heart, even if it was a doubt.To reassure my heart, and that is the words of a shame, who is asking for the purpose of whipping, and among them is that the doubt is in the capacity of God, the Almighty must doubt the prophecy.His Excellency said: You did not believe in his mouth and the Jahan of them: that he is understanding in the sense of the report.The intended from this question is that he answered what he answered with him so that the Samait know that peace be upon him was a believer in that he is a disobedience to him and that this is the one who is the one.He said, but to reassure my heart, so know that the mother is in “to reassure” is attached to a deleted, and the ability: I asked that the will of the heart of the heart, and they said: It is removed from the phases that are exposed to the inferred, otherwise they will be seen by both the two states.Some of it will be stronger than one, and there is a difficult question, which is that the human being is the knowledge of knowledge for him either that it is permissible to make it to be either.With the face of the faces, and that is a strong belief, and it is not permissible.Rather, it is directed if we say: the one who is required is the inclusion of reassurance in the power of God Humanity on life, but if we said: the intended thing is something other, then the question is good.As for the saying of the Exalted: He took four of the birds, and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: He took a lean, an ease, a western and a rooster, and in the saying of Mujahid and the son of Mujahid Divide in the ease, and we are research: the first search: that when the birds were summed up from the sentences of the tales in this case, they mentioned in it and the one who is the one: The air, and the successor was his high and the rocks to the king, so his miracle made his problems for his concern.And the second face: that the caliphate, peace be upon him, when the pilgrim slaughtered and made it a piece of cut, and put on the heads of every mountain, a disorder, and a disorder, and a fool, so His problems, and he said to him: As every part flew to his problems like this on the day of resurrection, every part flies to its problems until the eternity will be spoken and the eternity, and the eternity will be spoken.Its exaltation said: They come out of the events as if they were a vocalist infection [Al -Qamar: 7].The second research: that the intended of life and death was with one time, so he did not take a matter of four animals?In it, Jahan: The first: that the meaning is that you asked one to the destiny of the servants, and I give four to the capacity of the grapes.The second: The fourth eternity is a sign of the four of which is the one who is installed by the animals and the plants, and the sign is in it that you did not separate from this one who does not separate the fourth of this.The spirit is on the authority of the air of the narration and the descending of the world of Jerusalem.The third research: He specialized these animals because the whisper is a sign of what is in the human being, the love of adornment, the ignorance, and the raising, he said: Zain for people: The flexible is a sign of the severity of the passion for eating, and the rooster is a sign of the severity of the passion for spending the desire of the vine The weapon is that it flies with the night and comes out with the end in the end of the cold for the request, and the sign is in it until the human being did not seek to kill the lust of the soul and in the way The adultery of the creation was not found in his heart a wind and a comfort from the light of the majesty of God.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: He will be upon you, and it is in it.Saying: The first: that I have become a good thing if he dictated it to him, and a man who depicts any of the neck, and it is said: So and so if so if he said to him and he is money for him, and he said to him The words are deleted, as if it was said: they are inspired by you and their cutting them, then make every mountain of them a part of them, so the sentence is deleted that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same To him, as his saying: that he was stirred with your stick (p-37) the sea, and he closed [Al-Shua’ar: 63] in the sense: He was struck and closed because he said: then he said: Then he said: A part that indicates a cut.If it was said: What is the useful in his matter by ensuring it to himself after taking it?.We said: It is good for him to contemplate and know its crocodiles and its inhabitants, so that it will not be stolen after the life, and it is not understood that it is not.And the second saying: It is the saying of Ibn Abbas and Said bin Jabir and Al -Hassan and Mujahid, so they will be blessed with you with their cessation of them.A vision describes a characteristic of the lion: we are borne by judgment, that is, we cut it, and on this saying, he does not need the guarantee, and the reader of Hamza is the broken of the sake of the sake, so it is the same Also, it is tassel, and the last of the domain, as for the hopes, al -Farah said: This is a language of this and a peace: it becomes his life if he dies, and he said: Al -Saad: Cut them.It is said: He became clear it if he interrupted him, the deceased said: I think that this is a decrease from a city that will be seen if it is cut off, so I came to her, as they said: “Mother”, he said: Each one of these people is the origin of itself, which is self -evident, so it is not permissible to make one of them a far from the other.The second question: the people of the interpretation are collected on the fact that what is meant by the verse: they cut them off, and that his brightness cut her members, her feathers, and her blood, and her blood, and her blood.Only a Muslim father, then he denies that, and said: The prohibition of peace be upon him, when he asked the life of the dead from God, may God bless him, for example To you, the righteousness and the passing of the answer, that is, the fourth fighter has been accustomed to the fourth, to make it clear that if you called it, he answered you and came to you, so if you become like that His life, then let them come to you in pursuit, and the abuse of it is a masculine example in the return of the souls to the bodies on the path of easy.And the saying denied that what is meant by him: they cut them, and he was broken upon him by his faces: The first: that the famous in the language in his saying: So, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: And the sacrifice is not in the verse that indicates it, so it was its perception in the verse in order to increase the perception of the verse, and the evidence indicated that it is not permissible.The second: If what was intended to be seized, they did not say to you, for that is not that it is not prepared to it, but rather it is attributed to this mind if it is with me.If it is said: Why is it not permissible to say in the words of the last and the last, and the ability: He took four of the birds to you?.We said: The commitment of adherence and delay is from a manifestation that is referred to its commitment to the disagreement of the appearance.The third: that the guilt is in his saying: Then they invite them To them, not to its parts, and if you are the parts of separation, and the floor is on every mountain, some of those parts are required that the opponent be a fad to the part of the part Al -Zahir, and the one who is also in his saying: He will come to you with a pursuit that is domesticated to it, not to its parts, and on your saying if some parts seek to some of the parts of the righteousness in you To her.And those who say the saying that the famous said: The first: The first: that all the beneficiaries who were before my father, a Muslim who were gathered on the authority of the one who gave it to the one who had the same Its parts, so the denial of that is a denial of gatherings.The second: that what is mentioned is not devoted to Abraham ﷺ, so he does not have it in it.The third: that Ibrahim wanted to see him as how he revives the dead, and the appearance of the verse indicates that he is answered to that, and according to the saying of my father, a Muslim.And the lord: that his saying: Then make every mountain of them a portion of (P-38) on that that the good was made a part in part, and the father said in the answer The face: He added the part to the four, so it is necessary to be the one who is the one from that four.The answer: that what you mentioned, even if it is an assigned, is that the part is carried on what we mentioned, and the estimation is: Make it on every mountain of each one of them.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Then make every mountain of them a part, and it has questions: the first question: the appearance of his saying: on every mountain of the mountains Mujahid and the laughter to the general, according to the place, as if it was said: He separated it on every mountain that you can separate from it, and Ibn Abbas, Al -Hasan, Al -Hasan, Al -Hasan, and Al -Hasan, said: According to the fourth goodness and on the following four flaws, I mean the outlook, the Maghreb, the north and the south, and Al -Saddi and Ibn Jarraj said: Seven of the mountains; Because what is meant every mountain is witnessed by Ibrahim, peace be upon him, until the supplication of the bird is correct, because that is only the witness, and the mountains that were seen by the righteousness Peace is seven.The second question: It was narrated that ﷺ was commanded to sacrifice it, degenerate its feathers and cut it in part, part of its blood and its blood, and that it will be blessed, and that it will be blessed with it It makes its parts on the mountains; On every mountain of a quarter of a four -way, then he shouted with it: the Almighty with the permission of God Almighty, then he took every part that flies to the other until the boundaries A corpse to its head, and every head joined his corpses, and all became a living with the permission of God Almighty.The third question: a relative of the narration of Abu Bakr and Al -Fadl, “Part,” is a slight, as they are, as they are in a place, and the rest is a lighter, and they are two luminous.As for his saying, the Almighty: Then they invite them, he will come to you, and he said: an enemy and a walk on their legs; Because that is the most beautiful in the pilgrimage, and it was said: a good and not correct, because it is not said to the bird if it flew: he is seeking, and for those who answered it that the pursuit is that it is the one who is more Folding, and the pursuit of it is to increase in that movement.Our companions have brought this verse that the structure is not a condition in the validity of life, and that is because it is the highest that made every one of those parts of the part On the authority and enemy, it indicated that the structure is not a condition in the health of life.The judge said: The verse is indicative of the fact that the structure must be from where it is necessary to cut its life.The answer is that it is weak because the conclusion of the comparative does not indicate the duty of the comparison, but the dismantling of it in some cases is that it is indicated by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the comparison.And a duty, and when the verse indicated the fact that the call, and the ability to seek to be the parts if it separated it, it was an indication that it was not for the sons.As for his words, he said: He knew that God is dear wise, so the meaning is that he is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities “wise”, meaning: knowing the consequences of things and the purposes of things.
