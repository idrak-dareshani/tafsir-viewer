The researcher of the Quran, his transcendence: or as a swarm of the sky in which injustice, thunderbolt, and lightning make them shock in their ears from the thunderbolts, the caution of death, and God is the best Their eyes are kidnapped as they lit up for them, and if they are darkened to them, they rose up, even if God wanted, he gave them with their hearing, and their sight is that God is upon him The second proverb of hypocrites and the semi -softening of his face The rain has the roses of the thunderbolts to them, they make their shock in their ears from the thunderbolts warned the death, and that the lightning hardly, then they will be kidnapped, then they will be shed They went in a great injustice, and they stopped confused; Because whoever has brightness in these three darkness, then he went away from him, his life is tired, and the injustice is glorified in his eyes, and he will be for him, and he will not be in the dark.So the hypocrites in their life and their ignorance of the religion likened to the religion of those who described them, as they did not see a way and do not guided.And the second: that the rain, even if it is navigated, is that it was found in this image with these harmful conditions, the benefit has become a good, so the end of the faith is the end of the faith.Al -Batin: If the salvation is lost from it and the hypocrisy will become a harm in religion.And the third of it: that those who descended with these things with the thunderbolts of the sake of the sake of it to make his shock in his ears, and that is not saved from what he wants from what he wants, When this was decided in the habits, the exalted of the hypocrites in their thinking is that their purification of the believers, what they appeared to benefit them, with the fact that the matter is in the truth.And he pushed it: that the habit of the hypocrites was the delay from jihad, with death and death, and God likened their condition in that, in the case of those who have come to this, and this is the same He makes his sake in his ears.Fifthly: that these who make (P-71) in their ears, and if you get rid of the death in that hour, then the death and the klas are not behind them Likewise, the state of the hypocrites is that those who are fighting in it are not saved from the torment of the fire.And its sixth: that this is the case of the end of the life in the life of the resurrection of the types of darkness and the obtaining of the types of fear, and the hypocrites were obtained in the hypocrites in the end of the life Fear in the world; Because the hypocrisy is perceived at all times that if the wives got his interior, he would be killed, so the man and fear almost disappear from his heart with the heart.And the sequence of it: What is meant by the sinner is faith and Qur’an, unjust, thundering and sparkling are the hard things on the hypocrites, which are the clogged The hardships of prayer and fasting, leaving the hedges and jihad with the fathers and mothers, and the leaving of the valuable tools, and the purity of Muhammad ﷺ with the severity The human being is in the way of the righteous rain that is the most severe of the things that are beneficial in the cause Comparative matters, and what is meant by his saying: Whenever they are lit up to them, when they have something for them, and it is the infallibility They desire in religion: and if they are oppressed by them, they will do any of when they did not find anything from those benefits, then they will distort the faith and do not want it to be.In the likeness, and it remained on the verse as a question and a wardrobe.The first question: Which of the two representatives is the most noticeable?The answer: the second representation; Because he indicated the excess of life and the intensity of the ancient, and that is why they see them in the face of this from the most elderly.The second question: Why did one of the two representatives be overwhelmed by the other in the risk of doubt?The answer is from his faces: one of them: because “or” in its origin is equal to two things, as a matter of doubt, and then expanded in it, so it was expanded to equal to the equivalent of the suspicion, like the one who is a doubt Sirin wants that they will be in the right to be sitting, whichever you want, and it is the saying of the Almighty: and do not obey from them a sinner or a disbelief [human: 24] that is, that the sinner is in the sinner.Their disobedience is, so his saying: Or as a sinner that means that the existing of the hypocrites is a young man with the two parties, so that the two story are, so they are the two of them And if you represented it all, then you are.And the second: Rather, it was mentioned.Because the hypocrites are the two of them, each of them resembles the owners of the fire, and some of them resemble the people of the rain, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: And they said: And his saying: How many villages of our people came to her, and they came with us with pains or they said [Al -Araf: 4] and the third: or in the sense of God, he said: And we sent him to a hundred 147].And its booster: Or in the sense of waw, as if he said and a pill from the sky, his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: that you eat from your homes or the homes of your fathers or the mother of your mother.The poet: ؎ I have claimed that I am a successful thing for my soul, or on it, and this is the face of it Or the most cruelty [Al -Qarah: 74] The third question: similar to the Lord, the shades, the thunderbolt, the lightning, and the thunderbolt, what is it?Answer: The scholars of the Bayan are we say: One of them is that this is similar to separating and means that the proverb is a compound of things and the representative is also a compulsion (p-72).It is all One of the ideals is a young man with each one of the actor, so we likened the religion of Islam to the Lord; Because the hearts live in the life of the land with the rain, and what is related to it from the youth of the infidels with the shades, and what is in it from the promise and the bond of light, and the righteousness, and what is offended, The side of the people of Islam with the thickness, and the meaning: or as a form of a sinner, and what is meant is like a people whom the sky took on this description.And the second saying: It is similar to it, and it is similar to one of the two sentences in the last of the other things, even if it is not one of the sentences The last, and here is the intended, the beyond of the hypocrites in the world and the religion of the one who wore it, then its fire is shed after its poverty, and the wihath of the one who took it.The darkness is with rails and lightning, for it was said: you were able to like the separated from the excessive, and it is the one who said: Or as a similar one who is the same Likewise in the compound?We said: Without the return of the return in his saying: they would make their shock in their ears what he will return to, when we have a need for his ability.The Follow Question: What is the sinner?The answer: It is the rain that is corrected, that is, it comes down, from a young man who aims if he descends and from him, he corresponds to his head if he reduced him, and it is said: He is from a person who is corrected, and he does not say: The presence, “He was praying and peace be upon him, saying:“ Oh God, make him a hunger singer “” meaning a rain, and also it is said to the clouds of a sinner, the shamal said: And it is a sinner because he wants a kind of rain, as the fire denies the first representatives, and it is read "or as a young woman" and a sinner of this Parachute.The fifth question: His saying from the sky is what is good in it and the sinner is only from the sky?.The answer is from Wajin: The first: If he said: Or as a sinner in which injustice is carried that it is that the sinner be descended from some sides of the sky without some of the heavens, but he said: A year is applied to take the heavens horizons, so it was obtained in the word of the pillow, exaggerated from the side of the installation and the denial, which supported that by making it to be stained.The second: One of the people who said: The rain only gets a wet brochure from the ground to the air, so there is a complication of there from the intensity of the cold of the air, then it is the same The rain, then God, greet him and the height of that gossip, is that we have shown that that the sinner came down from the sky, such as his saying: and the water of us: 48] And it was said: It is revealed from the sky from the mountains in it from the cold [Al -Nur: 43].The sixth question: What is the throat and the lightning?Answer: The sound is the sound that hears from the clouds, as if the clouds of the clouds are obliged, and it is contradictory And if you take it, the wind took it, then voted at that of the darkening, and the lightning that is shining from the clouds from the lightning of the thing with a luster if it is shining.The seven question: The sinner is the rain and the clouds, so whom I want, so what is his darkness?Answer: As for the injustice of the clouds, if it is a delicate, it is the injustice of its charm and its fitness, it is the injustice of the night, and the injustice His condensation and harmony by following the diameter, and its injustice remained in the clouds with the injustice of the night.The eighth question: How can the rain be a place for the horror and the lightning, but rather the clouds?.Answer: When the relationship between the clouds and the rain is severe, it is permissible to conduct one of them, the other course in the rulings.(P-73) The ninth question: Is it said that Ra`wad and the lights were said as injustice was said?الجَوابُ: الفَرْقُ أنَّهُ حَصَلَتْ أنْواعٌ مُخْتَلِفَةٌ مِنَ الظُّلُماتِ عَلى الِاجْتِماعِ فاحْتِيجَ إلى صِيغَةِ الجَمْعِ, أمّا الرَّعْدُ فَإنَّهُ نَوْعٌ واحِدٌ, وكَذا البَرْقُ, ولا يُمْكِنُ اجْتِماعُ The types of throat and lightning in the single clouds, so it is not a crime, and it is not mentioned in it.The tenth question: Why did these things come?.Answer: Because what is meant is types of them, as if it was said that there are dark injustice, and a thunderbolt, and a thunderous lightning.The sharp question is twenty: What does the guerrilla return in “they make”?.Answer: To the companions of the sinner, and if it is deleted in the memorizers, it remains in the sense and there is no place for his saying, they make it to be a nurse; Because when he mentioned the throat and the lightning on what is permissible for the severity and the height, it was if he said, so how are they with the same as that ram?He said: They make their shock in their ears, then he said: How are their condition with the same as that lightning, and he said: The lightning is almost kidnapped.The second question is ten:.The answer is the mentioned, even if it is the sacrifice, but it is intended as it is in his saying: they cut their hands [Al -Maaidah: 38] who is intended.The third question: What is the thunderbolt?Answer: It is a row, which is broken from a fire, and it is a gentle, strong fire that does not pass something unless it comes to it except that it is with its strength.The fourth question is ten: What is the surrounding of God with the infidels?.The answer: It is metaphor and the meaning is that they do not miss it as the surrounding is not missed by the surrounding it, and then there are three sayings: one of them is that he is a scholar who said: Something knowledge [divorce: 12].And the second: His estimated capacity is upon them, and God is surrounded by surrounding [Al -Baraj: 20] and the third: Hold them from his saying: except that he surrounds you [66].The fifteenth question: What is the supreme?.Answer: It is a speedy adoption, and he read a “kidnapping” by breaking the lean, and the opening is more correct, and on the authority of Ibn Masoud “Sit” and from the good ”he kidnaps,“ by opening the yaa and al -Khala, and its origin is shattered, and from it he kidnaps by breaking them on the follower of the yaa, and from the same He was kidnapped, and on the authority of Abi: He is kidnapped from his saying: People are kidnapped from their around [Al -Anakkab: 67].As for the saying of the Exalted: Whenever they have been distorted in it [the cow: 20], it is a third exile, as if it is an answer for those who say how they can make it in the case of the case, And what is meant is the severity of the affairs of the hypocrites, with the severity of the companions of the sinner and what they are in the end of the confusion and the ignorance of what they come and what they will come to.With the fear that their sights is shaken by those whispering, they are a step, so they made a way to walk, so if he hid and fled, they will not be bitten by.The movement, and if God wanted, he would increase in the row of the throat, so he deaf to them, and in the light of lightning, he blinded them.A deleted, or otherwise, in the sense of the word, the more they are distorted in the wounds of his light, and the reader of the son of Abi Abla, ““ Whenever he said, “ Whenever, with darkness then?.We said: Because they are burning on the possibility of walking, the more they are shocked by it, and they shake it, and it is not like that, and the closeness is in the shadow, and it is not the same And the meaning of standing up and standing and firmly in their place, and from it the market rose, and the water rose up, and it was active.Because the answer is indicated by him, and the meaning, and if God wills, that (P-74) goes with their hearing and their eyesight, he gave them to them, and it is a question, and it is that the one is the one who is the one who is a matter The thing is that it is not overwhelmed, and among them is the one who denies that, and claimed that it is only beneficial to the bond and transcends it with the verse and the news, but the verse is the one who says: Fare to hear them, and if he heard them, they would have been exposed to them [Anfal: 23] If he would have benefited a word, if the thing would not be overwhelmed, not the same for the time of the time.Because his saying: And if God knew about them, it is better for them to hear them, it is necessary that he did not know about it for good The exalted what I heard and that they did not take care of, but the numbers of the assumption are better, so it is necessary for him to have learned in them better, and what he knows is good, and for him, and the best of them is good, and for him, and he is good.“The blessing of the man is a lustful, and if God did not hide, he did not disobey him.“If you only benefit the bond, and God knows.* * * As for his saying: God is on all things, and he has books: the first question: some of them are those who inferred from him that the one who is the one said: He said: He said: He said: He said: He said: Something, And the supply is not able to find the existence of the suppliers, for which the ability is destroyed, and it is something, so the one is something.The answer: If this speech is true, it is necessary that what God does not appreciate is not something, so what is meant when God did not appreciate it, and it is not necessary.The second question: He brought their faces with this verse that it is not with anything, he said: Because it indicates that everything is valid for God, and for the sake of God, and for the sake of God, and for the sake of God.So it is obligatory not to be anything, and he also took over, with the saying of the Almighty: It is not like anything [Al -Shura: 11] He said: If he was the same He lies his saying: It is not like anything, so it is obligatory that it is nothing until this verse does not contradict, and know that this disagreement is in the name; Because there is no mediator between Al -Mawdoud and Al -Ma’amum, and our companions crossed two Jahin: the first: the saying of the Almighty: Say what thing is the greatest testimony.[Al -Awam: 19] and the second: His Exalted said: Everything is like that except his face [Al -Qasas: 88] and the exalted within the one who is in the abstaining of it, so it must be something.The third question: our companions took this verse that the abundance of the servant is a destiny for God, the exalted, the disagreement of my father, my father, and the father of Hashem, and the face of the The servant is something, and everything is valued for God Almighty with this verse, so it is necessary for the servant to be able to be able to be exalted.The following question: our companions have been invoked with this verse that the event is the case of his resurrection, a condescement in God.The verb is referred, for the woman is a fate before its resurrection, and the two companions are the one that the event is the case of its provision, and everything is the same, and this is the same It requires the rest of the resting place to be blessed by work with it, so he remained working in the place of the conflict; Because he is the state of staying in his power, in the sense that he is a loyalty to his execution, but as for the state of polish, it is impossible for God to be able to perform the execution of his execution, for the execution of his execution The first time of his existence, and he only remained able to find it.The fifth question: the publication of the public is a good way in the sentence, and also the publication of the public is permissible with the evidence of the mind; Because his saying: And God is over everything that is required that he be able to himself and then be specially in the mind of the mind, then it was said: If it is (p-75) Then it turns out that it is not true to all, this was a lie, and that is required to be stabbed in the Qur’an, our saying: Let everyone be said as it is used in the group, so it is used in the group The most, and if that is a metaphor in the language, it was not the seizure of the memorial in it as a lie, and God knows.
