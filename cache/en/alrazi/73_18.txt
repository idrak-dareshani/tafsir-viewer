The Quranic researcher is that he is the Almighty, he returned to their fear of resurrection again Its count is an effective and in it: The second question: the owner of the “scout” mentioned in his saying on one day, “the first: the first: that it is an effective with it, that is: how do you fear you You stayed on the infidels.The second: to be a difference, that is, how can you be piety on the Day of Resurrection, if you disbelieve in the world.And the third: that you are afflicted with “you disbelieved” on the interpretation of the unicorn, that is, how do you fear God and fear Him, if you do the day of the day and reward; Because you strengthen God, there is no meaning for it, except for the fear of his punishment.The third question: that it is a remembrance of this day, two things: the first: the saying of it makes the child a graying and in which it is in it: Hudaydah, on the day of the numbers of the children, and the origin in which the domain and the sorrows if the human being is aggravated by the human being, because the abundance of the domain of the soul is the rest of the soul.The heart, and that of the shortness requires the foolishness of the episodicism, and the vulnerability of the crucial and its weakness requires the failure of the food parts, and it is completely completely.Clearing to the word on the mixture, and that necessitates the happing of the poetry, and when they saw that the communication of the young is from the proud of the many concerns, they made the distress from the distress And the insult, and it is not intended that this day makes the child a right grievance, because the delivery of pain and fear to the boys is not unable to do.The second: It is permissible for what is meant and that day will be the same as long, and that the children are informed in it the time of the sheikh and the divinity, and it was asked about the one who said: المالالال The conquest filled the two benefits (P-163) and said: How does this likeness prefer in the Qur’an on the house of Al-Ma’ari?I said: From the faces: the first: that the feasts of the new people are not a passion, but the goodness of the children is graying, it is a wondrous person; As if the intensity of that day is transferred from the age of the childhood to the age of Sheikh With the severity.And the second: that the communication of the two benefits from the young man is the same as the poetry, and the poetry may be abhorred for perhaps with the fact that the strength of the youth will be the rest of this The verse is that it indicates the fragrance of the children in the weakness and the verdict and the numbers of the face of the face, and that is an end in the severity of that day.And the third of it: that it is the same The two benefits from the youngness is not in it.Because the two heads of the head are placed for the many of the domains; And for this reason, the young man is first in the two chapters, and after it in the path of the heads of the head, then the young is cropped in the two values, but it is not the same.The seizure of the youngness on all the parts of the head, but all the parts of the body as it is mentioned in the verse, and God knows.The second type: One of the horrors of the day of resurrection is his saying: Heaven is a break with it, and this is a description for the day with the severity, and that the heaven is on the authority of it, and it is the heavens, and it is the heavens, and it is the heavens, You think that you are from the cells, and its counterpart is saying: If the sky is breaking up (breakfast: 1), and there are two questions: the first question: why did he not say:?The answer is from his faces: The first: Abu Ubaidah narrated on the authority of Abu Amr ibn Al -Alaa: The sky said a breakfast, and he did not say a breakfast; Because her metaphor is the metaphor of the stall, she says: This is the sky of the house.And the second: Al -Farah said: The sky is feminine and remembered, and it is here in the faces of remembrance, and he sought a poetry: ؎ So they raised the heavens to him with the people of the people And the third of it: that the heaven of the sky is not my right, and it was not so it is permissible to remind it.The poet said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ It will be from the spread of the spread, the green tree, and the miracle of a sifted palm, and their saying: a breastfeeding woman, that is, with breastfeeding.The second question: What is the meaning of breaking it?The answer is from his faces: one of them: Al -Farah said: The meaning is a break in it.And the second: that the Ba in “it” is the same in your saying: I wrapped the oud with the arrival, and it breaks it with it, it means that it breaks out of the severity of that day, as well The thing is what it breaks into it.And the third of it: it is permissible to intend: the sky is burdened with a wealth that leads to its breakfast for the greatness Al -Arif: 187].As for his saying: His promise was an effective, so he knew that the guilt is in his saying (and his promise) is enticed to be a hand to the verb and that it is a return to the verb.As for the first, it is the meaning: this day is an effective day, meaning: the prepared is added to that day and the obligation of the fall; Because the wisdom of God is exalted and his knowledge is his rhythm.As for the second: that the meaning be the one (P-164), God is located, not referred; Because he is the Almighty, he is a delegate from the lie, and it is us, even if the remembrance of God is the Almighty, but it is good for the sake of the destiny to him to be the knowledge of it, With the explanation of the conditions of happiness, and it is known that their conditions are as a matter: one of them: what is related to the religion and the obedience to the Mawlid, so it is presented.The second: What is related to the treatment with the creation, and that indicated that it said: and be patient with what they say, and their migration is a beautiful migration.As for the hardships, they started their threats to the path of the busts, and it is the saying of the Almighty: and the attempt and the liars, then he mentioned after the kindness of the torment of the torment of the last The world, which is the adoption of the wilderness in the world, and then described the severity of the day of resurrection, then this was the bayet in the kidney, so there is no generosity of the words of the words:
