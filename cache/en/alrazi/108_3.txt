The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Your affairs are the first and in the verse: And the darkening of the arrogance enters, so they spoke, and they spoke, and the mosque in the mosque.This is one of the righteousness of each other with one, with God, the exalted, it will appear.The son of him will take his place after him, so if he died, his remembrance was cut off and we were disgraced from him, and his son, Abdullah, died from a cheek, and this is the saying of the son of the son People of interpretation.The second saying: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, when he was presented as the son of the son of Al -Asraf, Makkah, the group of Quraysh came to him, and they said: We are the people of Al -Saqiya and Al -Saddah So we are better, or this is the one who is from his people, who claims that it is better than us?He said: Rather, you are better than him, and he sent down: your affairs are the first and descended as well: you did not see to those who have given a share of the writers who believe in the jabbat [51].The third saying: Akrama and the month of Bin Hawshab said: When God revealed to his Messenger and called a Quraysh to Islam, they said: “Muddam” They are the opponents.The righteous saying: I came down in my father ignorant, because when the son of the Messenger of God died.It is with his choice, because the son of the son was not intended.The fifth saying: I came down in his uncle, my father is a flame, so when he saw him with his saying: Taafa for you, he used to say in his absence: he was over.And the sixth saying: that it came down in Aqabah ibn Abi Mu’at; And it is the one who used to say that, and know that it is not far from all of those disbelief that they say like that, for they were saying in it what is worse than that The most of them were persistent on this saying; So the novels were famous that the verse was descended in it.* * * The second question: the hook is the hatred, and the mileage is the hateful, and the bitter is in the language, the cutting of the pieces is said: its bit of its abhor, and it is the time of it.The sins of the sin, and it is said: for those who have no success, and from it, the perpetrator is the one who has no sin, and so is the one who cut off the good.Then the disbelievers, when they described it with that, are the Almighty that the description of this row is that of those who hate the way of the confusion in it, so if you say, if you say: A scholar other than him, if you know this, then the infidels are in which he is praying and peace: It is not He doubted that - God cursed them - they wanted him that he had cut off the best.Then this is either to be carried on a certain good, or on all good.As for the first: it is destroyed by his faces: one of them: Al -Saddi said: I was a Quraysh who said to those who died of the male of his children, and when his son died, the sake of God And Abraim in the city said: He was brought up, and he has no one who does his position, then he is the Almighty, showing that his enemy is the description of this row, so we see that we see you He has been cut off, and he was pleased with him, peace and blessings be upon him, every day that will increase and grow, and thus it is until the resurrection of the resurrection.And the second: Al -Hasan said: They cursed him with his unpopularity that he was cut off from the intended before his manifestation, and God Almighty has shown that his opponent is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same He was arranged, and the flags of Islam became high, and the people of the horny and the westernity are humble.And the third of it: they claimed that it was passed; Because he has no supporter and appointed, and they have lied; Because God Almighty is his money, and Gabriel and the right of the believers, but the disbelief was not a supporter or a love.And its possibly: the abode is the humiliating era, and it was narrated that “Abu Jahil took a hospitality for a people, then he described the Messenger of God with this description, then he said: Muhammad and his bodies, and made him a despicable humiliation, and when they reached the house of Khadjah and woke up to that, Khadijah was brought up with a rug, so when they made it, he made the father of the father.He cultivated him, and the Prophet remained upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.For the sake of success, so he was unclean, and he cultivated it on the ground again, and he put his foot on his chest.This fall.Fifth: that the infidelity when they described it with this description, it was said: Your goodness is the one who is the one who said that they have a loyal words that are brought up, and the one who is the praise is, It remains on the face of forever.And its sixth: that a man rose to Al -Hasan ibn Ali, peace be upon them, and he said: You have been brought up with the guys of the believers that you left the imam for the imamate, and he said: The Messenger of God saw the children of a mother in the sleep, they ascended a man, a man, and he had a man, and he had a man, so God Almighty revealed: We have given you the pot, for the sake of the destiny.The king of the children of the mother was like that, then they cut off and became turbulent.* * * The third question: the disbelievers when they are insulted, so it is an advertisement that answered it from otherwise His love, he assumed his own answer, for he is the truth Glory be to him, and he mentioned that in the places of this when they said: Do we show you on a man who predicts you if you are torn apart.Or with him a paradise [Saba: 7] So he said: Rather, those who do not believe in the hereafter in the torment and the distant delusion [Saba: 8] and when they said: He is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Your Lord with madness [pen: 2] and when they said: You are not a messenger [Al -Raad: 43] He answered and he said: Yes and the wise Qur’an is that you are among the messengers [Yass: 3] and when they said: Mujnon [Al -Asfat: 36] He responded to them and said: Rather, he came with the truth and believed the messengers [Al -Saffat: 37] and he believed it, then he mentioned the feast of his deeds, and he said: [Al -Saffat: 38] And when he said, he said: Or do they say a poet [Al -Tor: 30] He said: What we taught the poetry [Yass: 69] and when he said about them, they said: If this is only a dismantling, and he will help him and help him.[Al -Furqan: 4] He called them liars by saying: They came injustice and falsehood [Al -Furqan: 4] And when they said: The money of this Messenger eats food and walks in the markets [Al -Furqan: 7] The messengers, except that they eat food and walk in the markets [Al -Furqan: 20], for what is for this dignity.The following question: Know that it is exalted when he preached the great blessings, and the Almighty knows that the grace does not insult it unless the enemy becomes an enemy, and it is not the enemy.He said: Your goodness is the one who is in it, and it is a league: as if it is the Almighty saying: I do not do it for you to see some of the reasons for your country, and some of the reasons Anger.And the second: He described it as a vile, as if it is the Almighty saying: This who hates you is not able to do anything other than that he hates you, and the abhorrent, and the hateful of the abuse, if it is abusive, and the hateful, and the abuse, if it is abused, and the abuse, and the hateful of the abuse, So, his heart is burning with anger and envy, so that the hostility is one of the most important reasons for the custody of that enemy.And the third of it: that this synthesis indicates that it has become overlooked; Because he was not for him and hated, and the matter of truth is like that, because whoever is normal is a good thing, then God has mercy on the Almighty, not those who sponsor with his affliction.And its elevation: that the enemy and described the praise be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, with the few and humiliation, and himself with the many and the state, so God, the command of God, said: Whoever humiliates God, the many and the multiplication of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and the mourning, the mourning, and humiliation of the enemy, so he got between the first of the Surah and the last of the last of it For a kind.* * * (P-126) Fifth question: Know that whoever contemplates the selves of this surah and its capabilities, he knew that the benefits that we have mentioned to the wretchedness of what is the same By his knowledge from the benefits of this surah, like the diameter in The sea, it was narrated from Musalah that he had been exposed to it and said: We gave you the journey, so he separated your Lord and Jahir.The one who is required to face: one of them: that the righteousness and the synchronization are taken from this surah, and this is not exhibited.And the second: We mentioned that this surah is like a fullness because of what he accepted, and as the origin of what is after it, then the remembrance of these words and the only one that is the most important of this Surah.And the third of it: the great recklessness that is acknowledged by those who have a good tank between his saying: Your goodness is the most powerful and between his saying: that is the one who is a man, who is a man, who is a man This surah is that every one of the infidels has described the Messenger of God ﷺ with another description, and he described him that he has no son, and he is not for him, and he is not for him, and he is not for him, and he is not for him.Remembrance, for God, Glory be to Him, praises him, in which he entered all the virtues, and it is his saying: We gave you the proliferation, because it was not restricted by that, and it is not the same, The crime of all the cuisers of the world and the hereafter, then he commanded his life in the whole of obedience; Because obedience is either the obedience of the body or the obedience of the heart, but the obedience of the body is preferred by two things; Because the obedience of the body is the prayer, and the obedience of money is zakat, and the obedience of the heart is that it does not come with anything except for the sake of God, and the blame in his saying: (for your Lord) As if he alerted that the obedience of the heart does not get after the obedience of the body, so the obedience of the body was presented in the remembrance, and it is his saying: (separate) The heart is alerted it to the corruption of the people of pornography in the fact that the servant may seek me with the end of his heart from obedience It is necessary to be from salvation, then he alerted the words of the Lord to his condition in the restoration, as if he said: I was your Lord before you, and I will see you.On this obedience, then as it is guaranteed first of the grace of blessings on it, it is guaranteed in the last of the surah by volatility from it and the absence of the saying of his enemies, and the one who is the same With the flames of blessings, and the other with the inclusion of the blessings in the world and the hereafter, and God is his grace and the Almighty.
