The Quranic researcher (P-66) is the saying of the Almighty: I do not swear by the ghost of the vicinity, the words of the words in his saying: (I do not divide).[Resurrection: 1], with the vicinity of the sequence in which they say: The first: It is the famous, the phenomenon is that the stars are the gathered, the gathered, the gnos, the abstraction, the abstraction, and the conquest, He gave among the people among the people, and in the hadith, “The Satan is whispered to the servant, so if God remembers the sitting of“ ”, that is, he was held, and that is called.And it was said, it is said: a snake if the parks entered, which is the headquarters of the beast, it is said that the antelopes are said in its vicinity, and the woman is disturbed if it enters, it will be exhausted.Then they disagreed with the hooks of the stars and their churches on three faces.The appearance of the appearance: that is a sign of the feast of the penthouse of the Circus and its residence, its hungry is the gnus This is a wondrous condition, and there are great dazzling secrets.The second saying: What was narrated on the authority of peace be upon him, giving, fighting, and murmur that it is all the cries, and its cavity is a burden on its absence from the beginning of the evil Its appearance of vision in the night, that is, it appears in its places like the beast in its vicinity.And the third saying: The seventh of the car is to cost its sects and its hardships to what the Almighty said: the Lord of the Mashor and the Gharaba [Al -Ma’arij: 40] and there is no doubt that it is in it.They are the closest to the heights and the sacrifice to the name of our heads.On the authority of it from that lord, and its changing is a phrase for its return to it, so this is an improper, so the first saying will be the division and the severity of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the severity, The second is the division and located with all the cries, and on this condemnation, which I mentioned, the oath is located in the seventy way, and God knows best.And the second saying: that with the vicious gin is the seed, which is the saying of Ibn Masoud and Al -Nakhwi that it is the according to the coffin of the beast, and Said ibn Jabir said: It is the antelope, and this is the antelope, It is a retirement in the nose, because the cows and antelopes are on this righteousness (the severity).After that, he said: And the night if it is Asais, and this is with the stars, I have no longer from the cows of the beast.The second: The place of the division of God is the greatest and the highest rank was the first, and there is no doubt that the planets are the highest rank from the beast of the beast.The third: that (the seat) is a collection of bottom of the gnos, and the gathering of the serenity and the severity of the seat of the seat with the silence and the lightness, and it is not said: the seed is in it With tightening, he only makes the gin in wildfire, too, from the gnos, and it is its disagreement in the parks if it is absent from the eyes.His Excellency said: And the night, if the people of the language are mentioned, the people of the language are from the fading, it is said: the night is the night if it is accepted, and it is difficult, and if it is, and if it is, it will be.In the sense of the lesson of the saying of the lewd: ؎ If the morning, it will be exhausted, and it was answered by its night and Asaisa, and the Abu Ubaidah sang in the sense of the acceptance: P-67) Ascen, then some of them said: What is meant is the night, because on this estimation, the oath is located in the night of the night, and it is saying: His saying: And the morning, if he breathes, and those who said: Rather, what is meant is “more” and his saying: And the morning, if he breathes, that is, his light is extended and a gunfire, then he said: Referring to the first of the sacrifice, and it is the same as his saying: the night is when he was arranged and the morning if he travels, and his saying: And the morning if he breathes a sign of the ruling of It has a roll.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: and the morning, if it breathes, that is, if it travels as his saying: and the morning, if he travels, then in how the metaphor said: With his hearts and a wretchedness, so he made a soul for him on the metaphor, and it was said that the morning is breathless.The second: It likened the dark night to the sad, who was sitting, where he does not move, and the sorrow gathered in his heart, so if it is not.So, when he came to the morning, as if he had gone out of that sorrow, and he expressed his breath, which is a gentle liking.He knew that he was exalted when he mentioned the division of him, followed by the remembrance of the division on him, and he said: He said that a generous Messenger said: The Qur’an was revealed by Gabriel.If it was said: We are a strong forms, which is that it is a solution that it is a saying of Jabril, so we must believe it in that, if we did not cut it, the lord of the authority, There is no less than the invalidity, and if the matter is like that, it is proven that this Qur’an is required to be the words of Gabriel, not the words of God, and the ability to be able to be like the words of Jabril.He is a miracle, to be incapable of that Jabriel met him to Muhammad ﷺ on the way of misguidance, and he cannot be answered from him by the fact that Jabril is informed, not to do so With the grace of Jabriel, it is beneficial from the truth of the Prophet, and the righteousness of the Prophet is separated from the ingredient of the Qur’an, and the Qur’an is a miracle, and it is a miracle, It is obligatory for the rotation while it is referred.The answer is: Those who said: that the Qur’an was a miracle of the strain, but they went to that gold, with this question; Because the miracle of that saying is not in the eloquence, but rather in the negligence of those scientists and the reasons for the hearts, and that is what is not One of God is the Almighty.The second saying: that this one of the one who has told you is the one who is the one who has been mentioned in this surah, which is not a priesthood, no belief, no abuse, but it is a saying of it, but it is the saying With God Almighty, and know that he is the highest and described Jabriel here with six attributes.First: He is a messenger and there is no doubt that he is the Messenger of God to the Prophet, so he is a messenger and all the prophets, his nation His worshipers [Al -Nahl: 2] and he said: The faithful spirit has descended upon him on your heart [Poets: 193].And the second: that it is generous, and from its generosity that it gives the best of the gifts, which is the knowledge, the guidance and the guidance.(P -68) And the third: Its saying: It is strong, and then those who carried it on the severity, narrated that “He - peace and blessings be upon him - said to Jabril:” I said: The villages of the people of Lot are the fourth on the penches of my wings, even if the people of the sky listen to the poverty of the dogs and the voices of the chicken, my heart.The prophet was intended for the temptation of the Prophet ﷺ and Gabriel pushed him with a pushing up and fell asleep from Makkah to the Aqsa Al -Hindi, and among them is the one who carried it in the way From the beginning of creation to the last time of privilege, and on the power of God in the knowledge of God and in the reading of the majesty of God.And its booster: His Excellency said: When the throne is an angel, and this is the one who is not at the place of the place, the same is the saying In the face of the side with the same as his saying, “I am broken by their hearts”, but by the honor of honor, supervision, and glorification.As for (Makin), Al -Kisaei said: It is said that there was a place for so -and -so with a congregation and place, so that this place is the one who is given to what is asked.Fifthly: His Exalted: A objection, then I know that his saying: (Then) is a sign of the mentioned disobedience, meaning when the throne and the meaning is that it is in the mind of God The approaches are released from his command and refer to his opinion, and read "then" a greatness for honesty and a bay because it is the best of his enemy attributes.And its sixth: his saying: a trustworthy, that is, he is a trustworthy person in the life of God and his messages, God has deafening him from betrayal and shame.* * * Then the Almighty said: And what accompanies you with madness and carried out this verse from who preferred Jabriel over Muhammad ﷺ and he said: If you are among the words of it: It is a force when the throne is an angel, and then a mother and between his saying: What is your friend with madness, the great recklessness appeared: and he saw it with the one who has seen it.The sun is called in the saying of the whole, and this is an interpretation in the surah of the champion and what is on the absence of the hearts, that is, what is Muhammad The Qur’an and what is in the news, the stories, and the two suspicions are said: I thought more in the sense of its accusation, and it is not from the thinking that exceeds the two of the two, In accordance with them, that is, it is a trust, as it leads to God, and whoever reads the opposite, then it is from the miser The absence of the sky, which is a precious thing, so it does not sting it with you, and Abu Ali al -Farisi said: The meaning is that it is informed of the unseen, so he will show it, and it is not the same as it is that it is not.His flags until he takes on him sweets, and the choice of Abu Ubaidah is the first reader of Jahin: one of them: that the infidels did not make him disturb, but they are the one who is delusional, but he is the one who is delusional.Divide the breach.And the second: Its saying: on the unseen, and if it is the intention to be miserly, he said in the unseen because it is said: so that there is a light in such and so, and it is said to be like this.* * * Then the Almighty said: What is the saying of a descendant Satan that the people of Mecca were saying: This Qur’an comes with a Satan, and he will throw it on his tongue.In the authenticity of the prophecy, it is eager to the negation of this involvement, so how can this deny this reserve with the hearing evidence?We said: We have indicated that the saying is not standing on the validity The hearing.“ Their situation was represented in their absence of the truth and their entirety of it to the false You say to where you go and where do you go, and say the Levant goes, and the market went out, and the people of the delay were with this verse and his face.Then show that the Qur’an is what it is, and he said: It is only a male for the two worlds, that is, it is a bay and a guidance for the creation as a whole.
