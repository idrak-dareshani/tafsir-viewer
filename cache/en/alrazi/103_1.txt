That is, the world of the world has died, and (you) did not get back and know that you are asking tomorrow about the grace in which you were in your life, and you are in your life, And every one of the parachutes claims what is on you, if you are a loser, and his counterpart: I approach people their account while they are in a disappearance offered [Al -Anbiya: 1].And the third of it: that this time is great, and the evidence is upon him, saying to him, peace be upon him: I swear in the right of the winner with the sacrifice, so I was divided into the right of the loser by the era and that is because he was divided into the sacrifice in the right of the winner and preached to the messenger that the Messenger of the Messenger is in the right He promised him that his command to al -Adbar, then as if he says: Some of the day remains, and he urges him to manage in the rest of the rituals, and from some of the sins: The fruit was shouting and saying: They have mercy on the one who melts the head of his money, and may God bless the head His age is not acquired, so he is a loser.The third saying: It is the saying of a fighter: He wanted the prayer of the era, and they mentioned it in it.[Al -Baqarah: 238] The prayer of Al -Ashar in the Mushaf of Hafsa and was said in his saying: You will love them after the prayer, and they will be divided with God [Al -Ma’idah: 106].And the second: His saying is upon him, peace be upon him: And the third of it: that the expulsion in its performance is more difficult for the people to be crowded in their traces and their equivalents, the last day and their assumptions with their standards.And its booster: It was narrated that a woman was shouting in the city of the city and saying: I show me the Prophet ﷺ So the Messenger of God saw her ﷺ So he asked her what happened?I missed me, and I got off, so a son came from adultery, so I gave the boy in a debt of The vinegar until he died, and then with us that vinegar, then did I have a repentance?And peace be upon him: As for adultery, the grace has to you, but the child killing him is his hell, and the sale of vinegar has committed it (P-82), for you, for you The era “In this hadith is a sign of the disturbing the matter of this prayer.Fifth: that the prayer of the era with it will bring the seal of the obedience of the day, so it is like a ritual.The commandment with the repentance is like this with the prayer of the era, because the affairs are with its seductions, so this prayer was divided into this prayer, as it is a fool of its affairs, and the increase of the goodness of it, If you perform it on its face, your loss is a profit, as he said: Except those who believe and sixth: He zakat them [the age] of them is a man after the era is a liar.A division from where it is our action, but from where it is a mourning matter that God has worshiped us.Peace be upon him: “It is like you and the same as those before you, like a man who has rented a reward.So I did the Jews, then he said: Whoever does from the noon to the era with a marsh?So the Christians did, then he said: Whoever does from the era to the Maghreb with two rituals?So you did, and you got angry at the time and the Christians, and they said: We are more work and less wage!And God said: Did I miss anything?They said: No, he said: This is my best, and I will give him to whomever With it, his saying: The era is that of any and the era in which you are in it, so it is the highest, I swear by his faith in this verse and his place in his saying: and you are a solution in the country: [2] His saying: For your life [Al -Hijr: 72] So he said: Your worse and your country and your life, and all of it is like a kind of disobedience to him, so if you must glorify the state of the disobedience, then he will be The division, as if he is the Almighty saying: You are Muhammad, you attended them and called them, and they exposed you to you and what I have turned to you, so what the greatest of their loss and what was wrong with them.
