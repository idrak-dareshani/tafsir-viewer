The Quranic researcher (P-131) (Surah Al-Jin), which is ten and the faithful verses of the anchor ﷽ Say: I am revealed to me that he has listened to a blow from hein.﷽ Say to me that he has heard a blow from jinn and in which there are issues: the first question: People have disagreed with an old and a hadith in the evidence of hein and his denial, so we will be transmitted from The philosophy is his denominations, and that is because Abu Ali Bin Sina said in his message in the limits of things: Jin is a trauma of antenna formed with a different form, then he said: For the name.His saying: This is an explanation for the name that indicates that this limit is a explanation of the person who is intended from this memory, and that this truth is not for the exit, and it is the excess of the exit, And those who believe in the Anaba, they were recognized by the exoduses of heaven, and a great group of a group of fools and the people of spirituality, and the people of the spirituality, And they claimed that the lower signs were fractured, but they are weakened, and the kingdoms are the most powerful answer, but it is stronger.And those who are stable have been lost on two sayings: Whoever claims that they are not bodies or status in the bodies, but rather the crimes of a sense of its soul, they said: and they said: Equal to the self of God; Because its universe is not bodies, nor generosity, and the shameful in the robe does not require equality in the essence.Different in the way, such as the disagreement of what the symptoms are after its equality in the need to the place, so each other is good, and some of them are a badger, and some of them are like a generous, and it is a good.A diplomatic world loved to the mourners and pests, and the number of their types and their types does not know except God, they said: And their uniforms are in the same way With expertise, it is able to do, so these aspects can be heard, visible, and know the expertise, and the deeds are not dedicated, and the deeds are not.A different part that is not far from it that it is worthy of great severe verbs that the destiny of humanity is impossible for it, and there is no longer that it is also from it.A special affection related to this world, and as the evidence indicated that the first comment is the first comment of the soul that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is (P-132) A gentle scent that generates from the kindness of the blood parts and formed in the side of the heart of the heart, then by the mediation of the soul, the soul is attached to the soul Considering the members in which these signs are pleased, and it also has no longer for each one of these gin, attached to the part of the parts of the parts of the The part of the air is the first comment of that spirit, then by the mediation of that air in Another thick body that gets those aspects of attachment and dispersed in those dense bodies, and among the people who mentioned in the jinn is another way and said: And the heavy spice, if it separates its eternity and the strength of the power and the tampering of what is in that spiritual world from the exposure of spiritual secrets, then if he agrees that it is angry that it is angry That separation of the body was of the body, because of these problems, it will bring to the soul of the separation, it is related to this body, for the garden, for the sake of the heart.This situation agreed in the good souls, so the one who is a king is called, and that is a matter Senses.And the second saying: In Jinn, they are bodies.Then those who say about this gold, they disagreed with two sayings, some of whom are claimed that the bodies are different in what they are, but the shared between it is a one -and -one, and it is one of them, and it is one of them, and it is one of them, and it is one of them The place, the place, and the side, and its essence is emerging with long, present, and deep, and this is all a sign of the attributes, and the partner in the adjectives does not require the destruction of the purpose The different things in the arrogance of the essence are not obeyed.They said: And no one will be taken over the similarities of the bodies that it is said: the body is from where it is a body that has a single limit, and a single truth, so it is not necessary that it is not necessary The body is from where it is a body, but if the reversal is obtained in a concept that is added to that, and also because it is possible for us to divide the body, to the garden, and the garden, and the garden, and the garden, and the garden, and to And the slope, and the purpose of the division is partner between the sections, for the sections are all shared in the body, and the devotion is that it gets this characteristic, and it is the end of it.Informed and lower.They said: These two pilgrims are weak.As for the first pilgrimage: because we say: As the body is where it is a body that has a single one, and a single truth, as well as the offer from where it is the one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a one who is a sake, It is necessary for all symptoms to be equal in the numbers of the essence, and this is what is not said by a sane, but the right is when the spoil is not for the symptoms of the symptoms A blessing between them is from the tales, if there is a blessed destiny among them, then that was the blessing of it, and if it was like that, it would not have been for the sake of the nine.One species is one, if this is proven, then the symptoms are where they are symptoms that have a single fact, and it is not necessary for that to be among them, and the one is in the same way.It is equal in the overallness of what is, why is it not permissible for the situation to be in the body like that, as it is as well as the symptoms It is different in the blame of what is, then those disagreement are equal in a disposive description, which is its knowledge of its impulses, so it is also the permissible to be what the bodies are the ones who are the ones.In the fullness of its essences, then it is equal in a displaying description, and it is her as referring to the sense and a place in the place and the place, and it is a domesticity, and this is not the same It has originally.As for the second pilgrimage: It is their saying: It can be divided by the body to the gentle and the dense, it is also a vulnerable to the offer, so it is possible for it to be It is necessary for there to be a blessed destiny from the self (P-133) from equal in all the self, so it is not permissible for it to be the matter, so we are not in that, if there is no one if you do not The fact that the bodies are different, and there is no indication of the heroes of this invalidation, so they said: It is not possible in some of the gentle bodies that the air is not to be in.The types of air in what is in the waters, and then that what is necessary for itself is a special knowledge and a capacity for the strange verbs, and on this al -Qadir al -Qadir al -Qaddi In the back of the inferiority, and its ability to form the different forms is the appearance of the informed.The second saying: The saying of those who said: The bodies are equal in the blame of what the essence, and those who say this gold is also two groups.The first difference: Those who claimed that the structure is not a condition for life, and this is the saying of Al -Ash'ari and the gathering of its followers, and I have been inferred in this door, and it is a phenomenon.The structure is a condition for life, it was either said: The one life has gone through the entire parts of the parts or it is said: each one of the parts did a life on the same, and the first, and the first, and the first, and the first.Because the solutions of the single offer in the many are one, one is not reasonable, and the second is also invalid; Because the parts from which the body consists of equal, and the life of each of them is equal to the life that is based on the other part, and the ruling of the thing, The life of this part is limited to that life with that part of this part, this is a distraction from the other side, so the struggle of the light is obligatory, and it is not.It is clear that the life of this part does not stop at the second life of that second part of that second part, and if this is the one who is overlooked, this is the same.The one of the one part is elaborated by life, knowledge, capacity and will, and the saying of the saying that the structure is a condition, they said: As for the evidence of the abandonment, it is not that it is not Recall, which is that we have seen that when the structure was brought up with life, and when did you spoil the rest of the life, and the life of the life is required, so that life is standing on the authority of this Pillars, because the briefing does not benefit the piece with a journey, so what is indicative is that the condition of those who did not see as is the case of what he is guided, and also because this is the one who says: The habits of habits are denied, but those who permit them are not walking on his time A healthy ruling that is not a way to it, and it has proven that the structure is not a condition in life, and if it is proven this, it is not far from God, may God bless you.A lot of severe and severe things, and when this appeared to say that he was the presence of heaven, whether their bodies were gentle or thick, or a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, or a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, and a thick, Young.The second saying: that the structure is the condition of life, and that it is necessary to solve in the structure until it is possible for the hard verbs, so it is a matter The vision is present and the obstacles are raised and the parties are from nearby and distant, and the sensual is peaceful, then with this, the perception does not get, or is this?As for Al -Ash'ari and his followers, they have been married, and the disgraced, and they were judged by his abuse of mind, and Al -Ash'ari was invoked on his saying, and he said: As for the mentality, the first: the first: We see the great from the distance as young, and that is only that we see some parts of that distant without the distance with the same time.Those, the visual parts are like the ratios to the parts that are not visible.The perception is obligatory.The second: The great body has no meaning except the group of those parties, so if we see that great body on the enemy of the distance, then we are the one who is the one.Either the vision of this part is a coordination with the vision of that part of the other part (P-1334) or does not be, if the first is required to the role; Because the parts are equal, and if the vision of this part, the part of that part of that part would also be seen.Dura, and if this is not the convergence, then the vision of the jewel is the individual against that destiny of the distance, it is possible, then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The individual if he obtained one of the one that he will join him, so that he is not seen.The disgraceful, they have been reluctant to, if we were distinguished by that, we would have made us with our presence, so that we will not see them, and we will not hear them, so if we know them, then we know them And we said to them, so they allowed it to say: its water turned The seas is gold and silver, and the mountains are sapphire and tuberculosis, or it was obtained in the sky if the eye was closed to a thousand suns and moon, then when the eyes were opened, the eyes were shouted.The difference.The reason for this disgrace is that these disgraceful looked to these arriving matters in the curiosity of customs, so they were delusional that some of them are, and they are not.They find a righteous law, and a premium taking in the difference between the two chapters, and the matter is inspired by them, but it is obligatory to settle between the whole, and it is all, so the whole, so that the whole, and the whole, As it is the saying of the philosophy, or on all the stomachs, as it is the saying of Al -Ash'ari.As for the control in the difference, it is far away, if this is proven, the appearance of the permissibility of the saying of heaven, then their bodies, and if they are thick, are strong, but they are not.This is on the saying of Al -Ash'ari, so this is the detail of these faces, and I am admired by these dismissed that they are how they believe what came in the Qur’an from the Qur’an from the Qur’an Their reversal on their doctrine, and that is because the Qur’an indicates that the angels have a great power for the hard actions, and heaven is also so Only in the thick, crucified members, then it is obligatory in the king and heaven to be like that, then these angels are present at us, and they are ever.And the memorization, and they are also attending the arrest of the souls, and they were attending with the Messenger ﷺ, and that one of the people did not see them, and so the people of the people were from the people The tendency does not see anyone, for if the thick seeing the presence of the presence, then what do we see it?And if the vision does not answer, then they are overlooked, and if they were described by strength and intensity with the intensity of the density and the crucifixion, then they were lost.Life, and if they said: It is a gentle and alive bodies, but it is for her rolls, and it is not appreciated by the hard work.With this doctrine, it is surprising, and they are mentioned on the validity of their doctrines, as it is a good likeness, and it is a preference for a clear argument.Purethections and problems, and by God the Exposition.* * * The second question: The narratives have disagreed that he was praying and peace be upon him..The first saying: It is the gold of the son of Abbas that peace be upon him, what he saw, he said: “Gin was intending to the heaven in the deception between Jesus and Muhammad And they throw it to the priesthood, so when God sent Muhammad, peace be upon him, the sky was embarrassed, and the thorn was tried between the two teeth and between the heaven, and the arms of the heavens, and they were sent.Press and tell him about the story.He said: This must be of this Because they were raised, the Earth of the Earth and its hardships, and they asked the reason.With his companions, the prayer of the dawn, so when they heard the Qur’an, they heard him and said: This is God who is between you and between the heaven’s news, so there is a return to them, and they said: (P-135) We heard a wonderful Qur’an, so God Almighty told the peace be upon him, peace be upon him, and he said: Say: I have been revealed to me and such and such.Jin; if he did not see them, this is the knowledge With the lusts, they are the demons, and those who heard the Qur’an are the Jinn, so how is the face of the collection?Gin who were in the body of the news.Repeated after the obedience of God, and they were different in that those who heard the Qur’an who heard the Qur’an from those who are?The Prophet ﷺ So hear the reader of the Prophet ﷺ, then they were disgraced and then said: And when we spent a blow to the jinn [Al -Ahqaf: 29] and it was said: And the general year of the elders of them.Masoud: The prayer and peace be upon him said: God said: I am gone with you, O Messenger of God.So the proverbs of the halls were besides him as if they were the men of the ablution in their burials, as the humanity is buried in its burials until it was deceived, and it is lost.To him, he is the one who is the Qur’an, then the Qur’an recites, and his voice was still in the way, and they were stuck to the land until I listened to their voice, and they did not see them.For the Messenger of God ﷺ: What are you?I settled between his hands, so he said to me?When he returned to me, he said: Did you want to come to me?I said: Yes, O Messenger of God.He said: This was not for you, these gin, you would not listen to the Qur’an, then they gave their people to be warned, so they asked me the increase, and they will be provided, so I did not.One of the greatness or nakedness is intense.One of them: Perhaps what Ibn Abbas mentioned was first, so God revealed to him with this surah, then he was commanded to be exalted to them after that.And secondly: that it is possible that the occurrence of the heaven is one time, except that peace be upon him, commanded them to go to them, and the Qur’an is upon them, but he is upon them They said, and anything, so they did, for God Almighty revealed to him that it was such and such and so.They returned to their people, they said to their people on the way of the story: We heard a wonder Quran, and such and such, so God revealed to Muhammad, and he said: This face is an induction, so it is not a way to deny.For his companions, what God has revealed in the occurrence of heaven, and in it is a benefits: one of them: to know that they are upon him that peace be upon him, as he was sent to mankind, so he has been done.Quraysh is that the jinn with their repetition, when they heard the Qur’an, they recognized its miracle, so they believed in the Messenger.He knows that the gin is listening to our words and understanding our languages.Many if people know it.The famous reader: I am inspired by a thousand, and in the narration of Yunus and Harun, on the authority of Abu Amr “Wahi” by the addition of waw with a thousand and they are two languages, and it is said: It was greeted by the costume of others, and the origin of it is wiped, so the waw was wrapped as a prodigy, as it is said that it is considered and ears, and if the messengers are done [the messengers: 11] An alienate from the jinn has questions: the first question: they gathered on his saying: that he listened to the opening and that is because he is a deputy, so he is a deed, so he is like this, and he is the one who is like this The Qur’an [Al -Anam: 19] and gather on a break that we say: We hear because it is a beginner, after the saying, then we are two readings: The two people Those who showed us that they gathered them on them, because what was from the revelation was conquered, and what was from the saying of heaven was broken, and all of them are the saying of the jinn except the others, and it is the one who says: 18] And that when [Al -Jin: 19] rose.And secondly: the opening of the whole, and the appreciation: then believed in it and believed that it is the Almighty, and that he was saying our sorry, and so the seeds, for if it is said: He said: The addition of faith to some of this surah is ugly to say that he said: We believed that he was saying our sorry for God.The second: It is that it is not overwhelmed by the murmur In the sense of our sincerity and witness, the two disorders are removed.The second question: a group of jinn is a group of them between the three to ten, it was narrated that that alienated was the best, and the good remembered that there is no one in them, Then know that the jinn narrated things: * * The first type of what he was told: His Excellency said: So they said that we have heard a wonderful Qur’an, and we will be guided by the guidance of us, and we will be guided by us.No one said to their people when they returned to them as his saying: When he spent and walked to their people, they were warned [Al -Ahqaf: 29] And his organizations, and (wonder) is a source that puts the place of the wondrous, and there is no doubt that it is the most abundant of the wondrous, guiding to the rationality, that is, to the right, and it was said: With the Qur’an, and it is possible that what is meant is that we believe in the rationality that is in the Qur’an, which is the neutrality, and we will not publish you with our Lord, that is, and we will not return to what we have (p-37).It indicates that these gin were among the participants.The second type: From what Jinn mentioned, as they deny themselves from themselves, the evil, and their Lord removed from the companion and the father.They said: And that the Almighty is the grandfather of our Lord, what he took a friend or a boy in which he has books: The first question: In the grandfather, they say: The first: The grandfather in the great language is said: The hadith: “The man was if he read the cow’s wall, so we found it.” Because the companion is taken for the need for it, and the father is to multiply with it and the people, and this is one of the features of the limits, and it is his grace, which is out of all.The second saying: The rich grandfather and the hadith: “The grandfather of the grandfather does not benefit from The poor enter it, and if the people of the grandfather are loved by the people of the rich in the world, then it will be the meaning and that it is a richness of the need to the companion and the people.And I have a third saying in it That the grandfather of the human being, whose existence is from him, made the grandfather a metaphor for the origin, and the Almighty said: Which is the same fact that it is the duty of the existence, so the meaning becomes that its special truth is exalted from all the people of the family; Because the duty of itself must be and the obligation of the provision of all his buds, and it was not so it was impossible for him to have a friend and a child.The second question: I read our Lord with the installation of the distinction and the grandfather of our Lord with the fraction, that is, the truth of his Lord, and the right of his deity, and the right of the companion, and the right of the companion These gin when they heard the Qur’an, alerted the corruption of what the disbelief of the jinn had to, so return first on the evil and second from the religion of the Christians.
