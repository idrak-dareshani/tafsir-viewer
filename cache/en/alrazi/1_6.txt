The chapter, the chapter, the four in his saying, is the straight path, and in which the first benefits are the benefits of the first: to say: the worshiper is inevitable, and that it is a believer, So the prayer is guided, and if he said, our guidance was a running neighbor, that whoever has the guidance for him, then he is asking for gift On the authority of his faces: The first: What is meant by him is the first path of those in the heavens of great hardship for the sake of the pleasure of God Almighty.It is narrated that Noah, peace be upon him, was hurting every day like this, where he was faded, and he said every time: “Oh God, the most guidance of my people, so they do not know.” If it was said: Our Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, said that only one time, and he used to say every day times, so let him say: “Noah is upon him, and he is the best of him What is meant by his saying was the guidance of the straight path, asking for that virtuous ethical from God Almighty, and the Messenger, peace be upon him, was reading the conqueror in every day.The Messenger ﷺ in this word is more than the words of Noah, peace be upon him.The second face in the answer: that the scholars have indicated that in every creation of the morals, the differences and extensions, and they are the slander, and the truth is the mediator, and it is sure of that Likewise, we have made you a nation and a simplicity [Al -Baqarah: 143] and that medium is justice and righteousness.(P-206) The situation is not the case with the justice that is the intermediate line between the excessive and excessive excessive and dedications in the witnesses of the Shahwani and in the anger of the money, and in the money of the money, and in the money of the money, and in the money of the money, and in the money of the money He asks for God to guide him to the straight path that is the medium between the two parties of excess and excessiveness in all morals and in all the work, and on this, the question is.The third face: that the believer, if God knows one, is one of the afflictions, but it is not possible His wisdom.Perhaps the religion of the human being was valid for the same evidence, and he remained unaware of the signs of the evidence, so we said the guidance of the righteous path, which is known to us.Its significance is on your self, your attributes, your ability and your knowledge, and on this estimation, the question is false.The lifted face: that he is upset, he said: And you are guided to a straight path, the path of God who has what is in the heavens and what is in the earth [Al -Shura: 52-53] and he also said to Muhammad A straight, followed by [Al -Anam: 153], and that straight path is that the human being is a blindness, except for God, as accepted by his heart and his mind And his remembrance of God, so we say to us the straight path that is intended to guide him to the straight path that is described by the description of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same If he was commanded to slaughter his son, he would not have obeyed, as he did it as a prohibition of peace be upon him, and if he commanded that he would be criticized, he would be slaughtered by him, so he would not have obeyed him.And if he was commanded that his soul would be threw up in the sea, he would not have obeyed as he did Yunus, peace be upon him, and if he was commanded that he would be fulfilled to whom he knows the best of him He obeyed as Moses did with the green on them, and if he commanded that he be patient with the matter with the well -being and the forbidden from the denial of the killing and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one He lives with them, peace be upon them, so what is meant by his saying: We guided the straight path is the righteousness of the Prophet of God in the patience, on the stability, and no This is a huge strictness; Because more creation has no energy for them, except that we say: O people, do not be afraid and do not grieve, for it is not a matter of distress in the religion of God, except for expanding; Because in this verse, it indicates the ease and the ease; Because he is the Almighty, he did not say the path of those who were beaten and killed, but he said: The path of those who have been blessed with them, so let you be able to do you.My father saw him committed the cabares as I committed them, and I was presented to the ticks as I came to them, then I saw him when he approached his death And Al -Fawz with Paradise, then it is from whom you have been blessed with his success for the trusteeship, then you were blessed with it that you accepted his repentance, so I say: The evaluation is a request for the arrangement of the repentant, so if you find it, then ask the rituals of the Prophet, peace be upon them, then this is the interpretation of the saying: The fifth face: as if the human being says in the way: the many loved ones are running me into a way, and the people are to a second way, and the Satan is to a third way, and so is the saying in the Shahu al -Shah And envy, as well as the saying in the obstruction, the analogy, the forced, the destiny, the hope, the bound, the refusal, the rituals, the mind, the weak, the life is short, and the industry is a ritual And the judiciary is difficult, and I was confused about all, so I guided me to a way that brought it out of paradise.And the straight: the level in which there is no thickening.It is narrated from Abraham Bin Adham that he was walking to the house of God, so if he is an Arab on his camel, he said: O sheikh to (P-207) where?Abraham said: To the house of God, he said as if you are a madman, I do not see you a ride and no more, and the travel is long.He said: If I got off with a meal, I would ride to me Publishing the patience, and if a grace came to me, I installed the richness of the thank you, and if the judiciary comes to me, I would ride the satisfaction of the satisfaction, and if the soul is called to the thing that I knew, I did not know that From what he went on, and the Arabs said: A secret with the permission of God, so you are the righteous while I am the man.The sixth face: some of them said: The straight path: Islam, and some of them said: the Qur’an, and this is not valid; Because his saying: the path of those who have been blessed with them with the right of the straight path, and if it was like that, the estimation is: We guided the path of those who have been blessed with them.We were presented from the nations that had no Qur’an and Islam, and if it is prolonged, it is proven that what is meant is the right of the path of those who deserve it to the paradise, but the path of the path, but the one said, but the one said, but he said: The way, and if everyone is one, to be the memorial of the path, a remembrance of the hell, so the human being is more fearful and fearful.The second saying in the interpretation (our guidance): that is, we have been proven to the guidance that you gave from, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: Our Lord does not overlook our hearts: We fixed us with guidance, so how much a weak similarity has a weak similarity in his mind, so he watered and humiliated, and he departed from the strong religion and the straight path.The second one: for a saying to say: Why did he say: We guided us and did not say: guide me?And the answer is from two faces: The first is that the supplication is the greater it is to the answer.Some scholars used to say to his students: If you read in the precedent of the precedent, “And may God be pleased with you and from the group of Muslims,“ If you say to you ” Well, otherwise, there is no embarrassment, but you and that you are in your saying, “And on the authority of the Muslim community“ because his saying, may God be pleased with you.He said about the group of Muslims, then it is necessary for the Muslims to be the one who deserves the answer The Sunnah, if he wants to remember a supplication to pray first on the Prophet ﷺ then pray and then conclude the words by praying on the Prophet ﷺ second; Because God Almighty answers the preacher in his prayers on the Prophet ﷺ, then if he is answered on the two parties of his prayers, he is forbidden to respond in his stretching.The second: The prayers and peace be upon him said: “Pray God for the year, what you disobeyed with it.With his tongue, which is what I disobey with your tongue.And the third: as if he says: O servant, you said at the beginning of the Surah: Praise be to God, and what you said: I am the rest of God, so you mentioned the first Hamad, so that all of you Honor them, say our guidance.The lord: As if the servant says: I heard your Messenger say: The group is mercy, and the difference A torment, and when I wanted to protect you, I mentioned the praise of all, and I said praise to God, and when I mentioned the worship I mentioned the worship of the whole, and I said: Using, I mentioned the entire use of all, so I said, and I seek help, so there is no crime when I asked for guidance, I asked for all, so I said: We guided us.The righteousness of the righteous, I asked the whole of the whole, and I said the path of those who were blessed with them, and when I asked for the murdes, I was a little On them or the lost, when I did not separate the prophets and the righteous in the world, so I hope that I will not separate them in the resurrection.The two prophets [Women: 69].(P-208) The third is the third: Know that the people of Al-Handsah said: The straight line is the shorter line between the two points, so the one who has the line is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The frozen lines, as if the servant says: We guided the straight path to his faces: The first: that he is close to the lines and shorten them, and I am not solemn, so he does not know Right.The second: that the straight is one and what is meant by a wave, and some of them resemble some in Al -Awwajjil, and the way is on me.For fear and pests and close to safety.The third: the straight path is connected to the intended, and the wave is not connected to it.And the lifted: the straight is not changed, and the wavy changes, for this reason, he asked the straight path, and God knows.
