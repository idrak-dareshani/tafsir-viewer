The third Qur’anic researcher: The judge said: This is one of the strongest what is indicative of the heroes of algebra, because if corruption is from his creation, then how can he be able to say: Some people will be sported, and the earth must not be on the authority of the people.Their saying- corruption, but it does not occur because God does not do it and does not create it, not for a matter that refers to people.The answer: that God is exalted when he was aware of the fall of corruption, then if it is correct with that science that corruption does not do, the meaning is that it is true that the servant is from the servant of the servant.With the existence of corruption, then it is necessary to be able to gather between the negation and the tricks, which is referred.As for his saying: But God is a preference for the two worlds, so what is meant by him is that the payment of corruption with this way is that the people are blessed with all of them, and all of them are the people, and the righteousness of all of us, With the judgment of God Almighty, and they said: If the servant did not create God Almighty, he would not have paid the truthful to the evil of those who are good, and for the sake of God The one who is responsible for that payment if he is the servant from his soul and his choice, and God did not have exalted The payment of God, some of them with some of them indicating that it is a virtue of virtue over the two worlds because of that payment, so this indicates that this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is Humanity and its estimation.If they said: This is carried on the Bayan, the guidance and the matter.We said: All of that exists in the right of infidels and the jaws, and the payment did not get from it, so we learned that the grace of God and his blessings be upon us, but it was the same We say, and God knows.Those are the verses of God, we recite it to you with the truth, and you are among the messengers.(That) referring to the stories that he mentioned from the hadiths of the thousands, their deaths, their livelihood, and your fullness, David's hand while he is a poor boy, nor (P-164) doubted that these conditions are sparkling verses indicating that the amount of God Almighty is His Excellency and His Him.If it was said: Why did he say: (That) and he did not say: (This) with that that he refers to it to a cloud, not to a present?We said: We have shown us in the interpretation of his saying: That book has no doubt in it [Al -Baqarah: 2] that that and that is returned to the meaning of this and this is, and this is also for this.After its remembrance, it became like the thing that passed and went on, and it was in the ruling of the absent, so this is the interpretation, he said: (That).As for the saying of the Exalted May the peace be upon you, but he has made the recitation of Gabriel, peace be upon him, reciting it for itself, and this is a great honor for Jabril, and it is like it Those who sell you, but they sell God [Al -Fath: 10].As for his saying: (with the truth), it is in his faces: one of them: that what is meant by the remembrance of this story is to be seen by Muhammad, and it is considered that it is in it, and it is considered that it is in it.As the believers carry it in the advanced nations.And the second: (rightly), that is, with the stigma in which the people of the book do not doubt, because it is in their books, as well as other than the origin of the origin.And the third: We have sent these verses on the face that is indicative of your prophethood by the reason for the eloquence and rhetoric.And its elevation: Those are the verses of God, we recite them with the truth, that is, it must be known that these verses are upon you from God from God, and there is no reason for the goodness Magician and magician.* * * Then he said: You are among the messengers, but this is the one who was presented to the fences of it: one of them: that you have told these sections other than that of you, and you do not know He, peace and blessings be upon him, was mentioned, but he mentioned it and introduced it to the revelation of God Almighty.And the second: that you have known these verses what was done on the Prophet, peace be upon them in the children Keep you, and the disagreement of those who are aware of you, because you are the same, but the source of the mission of the message and the compliance of the matter on the path of the choice and the abuse, not the one, no You are fought against you in their dispute and their disbelief, and the parallel in that is rejected by them, so it is a prayer for the Messenger ﷺ as it appears from the disbelievers, the disbelievers, the disbelievers His saying: You are among the messengers like an alert to that.
