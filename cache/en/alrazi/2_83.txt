The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And when we took the covenant of the children of Israel, you will not worship except God and the religion is charity, and the kinship, the orphans, and the poor, and say to the good Zakat, then you only assumed a little of you, and you are presenting that this is another type of kind of blessings that God has specialized The greatest of blessings is paradise, and the connection to the grace is a grace, for this is a mandate, not a matter of blessings, then it is the Almighty that it is the same as the first: His Excellency said: Do not worship except God and in which there are questions: the first question: Ibn Katheer, Hamza, and Al -Kisaqi read, “they worship,“ with the people, and the rest of the people.Tell them about them, and directed the violin that they were addressing and the seal of the Taa, Abu Amr said: Do you not see that he was a remembrance of his remembrance.The second question: they disappeared in the position of “worship” from the Arabs on five sayings: (p-150) The first saying: Al-Kasayi said: Raise him on the authority It was said: We took their covenant that they did not worship, except that when it was dropped, "the verb was raised as" as a way said: "Except, this is the death of the one who brought the absence Makhladi wanted to bring, and for that, he complied with him, “and he authorized this luxurious face, the varying, the gospel, the dirt, and Ali ibn Issa and Abu Muslim.The second saying: His position is a raising on the answer to the division, as if it was said: When we divided them with them, they do not worship, and the reward of this is the face of the ritual One of the words of the lighter.The third saying: The saying of Qartb: that it is in the position of the situation, so it will be his position as a stab.The righteous saying: The saying of the female is that the position of “do not worship” at the end, except that it came to the words of the news as the saying of the Almighty: The meaning is forbidden, and that is confirmed as a matter of things: one of them: his saying: (evaluate).And the second: that it is supported by the readers of Abdullah and Abi: (Do not worship).And the third of it: that the news is in the sense of the matter and the end, I am sure and informed of the goodness of the matter and the end, because it is as if it is a row on the compliance and the end, so it is to tell it.The fifth saying: the estimation is that you do not worship, "to be" with the verb, instead of the covenant, as if it was said: We took the covenant of the children of Israel.The third question: This covenant is indicated by the completeness of what must be in religion because it is up to the worship of God, the worship On the worship of others, it is preceded by the knowledge of it, and it is all.And it is permissible and improvised by it, and with the knowledge of its bodies and its opinions from the plots, the dads, and the brightness of the companion and the children, and the one who is also known The worship that is not a way to its knowledge is only by the revelation and the message, so he said: Do not worship except God Worship is only with it.The second is the saying: It is the Almighty saying: And in the debt, there is charity and in which the issues are: We said in it three sayings: The first: Al -Zujaj said: He erected in the sense of good deeds with charity.And the second: It was said in the sense of our guardians with the religion of charity because the connection of the Ba with it is good at this face, even if it was on the first, then it was: and to the parents: The third: It was said: Rather, it is the most kind news in the first sense, meaning that you worship and improve.المَسْألَةُ الثّانِيَةُ: إنَّما أرْدَفَ عِبادَةَ اللَّهِ بِالإحْسانِ إلى الوالِدَيْنِ لِوُجُوهٍ: أحَدُها: أنَّ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ تَعالى عَلى العَبْدِ أعْظَمُ, فَلا بُدَّ مِن تَقْدِيمِ شُكْرِهِ عَلى Thank you, and then after the grace of God, the grace of the two parents is the best blessings, and that is because the two parents are the origin and the cause in the cousin of the child, and the son With rapprochement, and other than the two parents, the year is not issued by the origin of the storms, but only with education.Exalted.The real influencer, who is the most influencing, according to the back.And the third of it: that God Almighty does not ask for his welfare on the servant of the bastard, but rather what is meant, but it is the sacrifice of public and the children like that, so they are not asking the one, for they are not.Financial compensation or reward, for whoever denies the date is improved to his son and raised him, so from this direction, it is more likely that God is exalted.The lord: that God Almighty does not bore from the public on the servant, and if the servant comes with the greatness of the wives, then he does not cut off the materials of his blessing and the pioneers of his rituals, as well The child and do not cut off the materials of their grace and their generosity, even if the child is bound to the parents.Fifth: Just as the accompanying parent is behaved in his son's money with the pursuit and demanded the increase and seek it from the underestimation and the shortcomings, so the truth is like it The servant, and he will be on the authority of the loss, and then he will make him make his work that does not remain like the remaining thing.In the way of God, like a love, the seventh of Sanab, in every sene, wore a pill [Al -Baqarah: 261].The sixth: that the grace of God, even if it is greater than the grace of the parents, but the grace of God is known to the recipient and the grace of the two parents, the one who is a matter On the basis of the blessing of God, then they are accustomed to this side and the risks to the blessings of God, so it is not a crime that made us the blessings of the two parents as the night of the blessings of God.The third question: the most of the scholars agreed that it is obligatory to glorify the parents, even if they are infidels, and it is indicated by his faces: one of them: Charity is not restricted by their believer or not, and because it was established in the origins of jurisprudence that the ruling arising on the description of the righteousness of the same The verse is that the matter is the greatest of the parents to be the one who is the religion, and that is the general one, and so is the recipient of the saying of God: And with the two sons, charity [Al -Israa: 23].And the second: It is the Almighty saying: Do not say to them, and do not rise to them [Al -Israa: 23] The verse, and this is the end of the exaggeration in the prohibition of harming them, and then he said: They have mercy as a young Lord, [Al -Israa: 24], and he expressed the two causes in the garment of this greatness.And the third of it: that God Almighty narrated from His Excellency, peace be upon him, that he is a kind of pleasure in calling his father from disbelief to faith in his saying: Oh, do not hear what is not.He sings anything from you [Maryam: 42] Then his father was hurting him and recalling the thick answer, and he is upon him peace, and he was baring that.Likewise in the right of this nation to say it to the Almighty: Then we have to you to follow the domain of Abraham Hanif [Al -Nahl: 123].The following question: Know that charity to them is not to harm them at the time and connect to them from the benefits of what they needed for them, so he enters into it, so he will enter into it.Caters and their command in the well -known path of companionship, if they are immoral.The third is the saying: It is the Almighty: The kinship in which there are issues: the first question: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: If only the approach of the approach of Za The forbidden and other than the forbidden, and the father and the son do not enter because they are not known to the relative, and the grandchildren and the dowry enter, and it was said: He does not enter the origins and the rituals.We are very expensive, which is that the Arabs memorize the high grandparents, and their relatives and all of them (P-152) expands, so if we would be up to us to the high grandfather, and we said, and we have said that Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him: He will fear a grandfather who is attracted to him and is known to him, even if he is a disbeliever, and the companions mentioned in his example: If he is the only one to the approval of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, then we will tell him to the sons of Shafi’i without the sons of the one who is required and the sons of Abd al -Munaf, even if they were the one who is a relative Mashour to a philosophy without Abd al -Manaf.Sheikh Al -Ghazali said: This is in the time of Al -Shafi’i, but in our time, he only behaves to the children of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, and he does not meet the sons of his companions, because he is the one who is a companion.In our time, as for the mother of the mother, it is entered into the will of the creek and does not enter into the will of the Arab The father of the father and the mother.The second question: Know that the right of the kinship is like the follower of the right of the parents because the human being is related to his closeness to the medium of their connection to the authority of the two, and the connection is to the authority of the two.It is presented to the connection with the kinship, for this, God has delayed his remembrance of the two parents, and on the authority of Abu Hurairah that he is the prayers and peace be upon him, he said: The day of resurrection says: That is, my Lord, I am injustice, I am offense to me, I have been cut.He said, and her Lord answers her: Do you not accept that I have cut off those who cut you and the origin of those who arrived, then read, then may you be able The mind in the affirmation of the sponsorship of this right is that the kinship is the suspect of the union, the fountain, the sponsorship, and the support, and if there is nothing of that, there is nothing in that The pain, the fragmentation and the harm, the more powerful, the more he accomplished, so the sponsorship of the rights of the relatives was obligated.The first question: The Yatim, whose father died until the dream is informed and his collection is a camel, and it is complete, as they say: This is in the human being, but in the other hand, he fulfills it from his mother.And to his fulfillment and his void of those who do it, he needs those who benefit from him, and the human being is a pen who desires in the companions of such It is great in religion.Poverty has dwelled it and it is more severe than the poor when the people of the language are the most, and it is the saying of Abi Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, and they are counted by the saying of God: And when Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him: the poor is worse, because the poor derives it from the vain of the noon, as if his pride was broken because of the strictness of the need.And they took over him with the Almighty saying: As for the travel, it was for those who worked in the sea [Al -Kahf: 79].The second question: but their custody was delayed from the orphans, because the poor may be in terms of it, and it is beneficial to it in the use of it.The mixing of the orphans, and because the poor people also can work with the covenant of itself and the reconciliation of its livelihood, and the orphan is not like that, so it is not the same On the poor.The sixth is the one who said: “And they say to people a good and in which there are issues: the first question: the reader of Hamza and Al -Kisa’i: (good) with the authority of the For the saying, as if he said: They said to people a good saying, and those who remain in the presence of H and the silence of the Sunnah, and martyrdom with his saying: And the one who is a good man: And with his saying: Then he changed a good after bad [ants: 11] and in which he is a face: the first: Al -Akhfash said: it is a good saying.The second: It is permissible to be well in the position of goodness as you say: a just man.The third: that the meaning of its saying is: and say to people, good.The first words are upon him.Funny: Well, which is a good saying in itself for its goodness.The second question: It is said: Why did they say after the news?The answer is from three aspects: one of them: that it is on the way of tafs, such as his saying: Even if you are in the king and run with them [Yunus: 22].And the second: It is a deletion, that is, we said they say.And the third: The covenant is only words as if it was said: I said do not worship and say [to people good].The third question: they disagreed that the addressee by saying: They said to people good, who is he?It is necessary to say: It is the highest that the covenant has taken upon them not to worship except God, and they will say to people good and it is possible to say: He is the one who is the one They worship except God, then he said to Moses and his nation: They said to people good, and everyone is possible with the refuading of the memorization, even if the first is close to the one that will be the one who is the one who will be the story The merits of the customs and the honor of the elderly from all the faces.The following question: Some of them said: The good saying is obligatory with the believers, but with the infidels and the immorality, there is no, and the evidence is upon him: And the ritual with them, how can the saying be good with them.The second: His Excellency said: God does not love the worse by the saying of the saying except for those who wronged [Women: 148] So he permitted the wickedness of misfortune to those who wronged, then that Those who say this saying from them who claimed that this matter has become forgotten by the verse of the fighting, and among them is those who said: He entered the specialization, and on this appreciation: Specialization will be signed by the addressee, which is that the intended and say to the believers is good.The second: that it falls according to the addressee, which is that what is meant is to say to people good in supplication to God Almighty, and in the matter of the well -known.On the first direction, the specialization is made to the addressee without the discourse, and on the second, he drives the discourse without the addressee, and the father of Jaafar Muhammad al -Baqir al -Baqir al -Baqir al -Baqir al -Baqir al -Bani The general remains on his backs and that there is no need for specialization, and this is the strongest, and the evidence is that Moses and Harun are with the majesty of their position, they are commanded by the companion and the one who is the one who is the companion Muhammad ﷺ is taught to the companion and the launch of the throat, as well as his words, the Almighty: Call to the path of your Lord with wisdom and the preaching of goodness [Al -Nahl: 125] They pray without God, and they may cause God to be an enemy without knowledge.Whoever holds it first is that it is obligatory to curse them and their vilification, so the good saying can not be with them, we said: First, we do not peace that it is obligatory for them The Almighty said: Do not curse those who call from God without God [Al-Anam: 108] Peace be upon us that it is obligatory to curse them, but (P-154) we do not accept that the curse is not.Bianh: The good saying is not a meaning of the saying that they desire and love it, but the good saying is the one who gets them with them and we will be blessed with them Let them call it the ugly verb, that meaning was navigated in their right, so that the curse was good and beneficial, as you are in the authority of the mother] It is good and beneficial from where he is frequenting him from the ugly verb, we greeted us that their cursing is not a good saying, but we do not peace.Good.He is that there is no contradiction between the one who is entitled to the greatness of the greatness That the good saying be with them, and the one who held it secondly, and it is the saying of the Almighty: God does not love the worse with the worst of the saying: It is permissible that what is meant by him will be revealed by the condition of the unjust, so that people can be removed from it?It is what is meant by saying it ﷺ: “Remember the evildoer in what is in it so that the people warn.” The fifth question: The people of verification said: The words of people with people are either in religious matters or in the worldly matters, so if it is in Religious matters, but it is in the supplication to faith, which is with the infidels or in the supplication to obedience, and it is with the evildoer, but the supplication to faith is that it is necessary and that it is necessary and that it is necessary Excellency Moses and Harun: He said to him a soft saying that he may remember or fear [Taha: 44] The command of God is the Most Merciful with the Paradise with the Paradise of the Paradise of Jalah Farnan, his murder, and his abundance of God Almighty, and he said to Muhammad ﷺ: And if you were rude, the heart will be overwhelmed, so they would not have been exhausted from you [Al -Imran: 159] The good saying is a good man, the Almighty said: Call to the path of your Lord with wisdom and the good preaching [Al -Nahl: 125] and he said: Pay of the best of you, then the one who is good, then As if he is the guardian of Hamim [Chapter: 34], but in the worldly matters, it is the one who is known for the harm that if it is possible to connect to the extent of the exaltation, the saying of the one who does not say.It was proven that all the etiquette of religion and the world are inside it under his saying: They said to people good?.The sixth question: the appearance of the verse indicates that charity is to the kinship, the orphans, and the poor were obligated to them in their debt, as well as the saying of goodness, for the good of the good Because I take the covenant indicating the garment, and that is because the apparent matter to the duty and because it is the Almighty to inform them about it, and that is the one who is in the authority of us, and that is the one who is in the authority of the matter Some of the faces, and it was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: Zakat has copied every right, and this is weak because it is not different that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the righteousness of it is the righteous, and it is the same It is necessary for us to believe us, and if the zakat is not obligatory for us until if it is not driven by their need for zakat, the charity is obligatory, and there is no doubt in Wajb They are hurt by it.The seven and eighth is to be called: His Excellency is: and establish the prayer, and they will pay zakat, and their interpretation was offered.He knew that he was exalted when he explained that he took the covenant upon them in this eight -aid, showing that he is with them to be upon them by taking the covenant to them.The great house will bring them to their Lord, and they took care of themselves and did not receive the blessings of their Lord with the acceptance of the acceptance with the virgin They are over, and that is increasing in the ugliness of the symptoms and funding they have; Because the adherence to the violation of God, after that, the end of the Bayan and the documentation would be greater than the violation with the ignorance, and they disagree with the one who said: You took three aspects: one of them: it is the one who came from the sons (P-155) Israel.And the second: It is a speech for those who were in the era of the Prophet ﷺ from the Jews, meaning you presented after the appearance of miracles, such as symptoms of your ancestors.And the third: what is meant With his saying: Then you took over whoever came with his saying: You are exposed and whoever is delayed.As for the first saying that if the first words are in the advanced ones, then the public speeches requires that the last one in them is also with a way that requires this This shows that he is the highest leg of the first words in the face of the purity of the blessings with the residence of the arguments on them, and then he explained that they did not come to them except for a few of them.In it.As for the second saying that his saying: Then you took over the discourse of his hospitality, and it is with those present, and what is presented is a story.Those, the righteousness and the events, as they have been committed to them.The same as those who have been obligated and you are with that, you have taken care of that except for a few of you, and they are those who believed and greeting, for this is the one who is the same Excellency when he showed that they were blessed with that blessings, then they took over from it, and that was indicative of the end of their actions, and their words are: Specialized with the time of Muhammad ﷺ, that is, you are in the house of the advanced who took over after taking these events, so you are after you Muhammad ﷺ You exposed him and disbelieved in it, so you were in these symptoms with the reward of those who are presented in that assumption, and God knows.
