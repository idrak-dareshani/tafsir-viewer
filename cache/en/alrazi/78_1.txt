The Quranic researcher (P-3) (Surah Al-Naba) Four Mentioned Mechanism ﷽ Do they wonder about the great prophet who is in which they are different from the one who wonder about the one who wonders from the one who is the one who asks about In it, they are different in it: Liem like Khenzir is empty in ash and the many recovery on the deletion and origins a little, remember in the causes of the deletion of Wahwah: one of them: the gospel said: Sing in a thousand, as the two of the two letters.And the second: Al -Jarjani said: If they described “what” in the understanding, they deleted a thousand separation between it and between it to be a name as their saying: Pay and the mother.And the third of it: They said: The thousand were deleted to connect the ruddy of the run until it became as a portion of it to report the intensity of communication.And the one that is: the reason for this deletion is the slightest in the words, as it is a lot of pronouncement of the trading on the tongue.The second question: His saying: uncle they ask that it is a question, and his saying: On the great prophecy, the answer of the questioner, and the answer is God, the Most High, and that is the Almighty, With all information.If it was said: What is the use of the answer to him?We said: Because the revenue of the words in the exposure of the question and the answer is close to understanding and clarification, and its counterpart: for the one who the king today is for God, the one who is the one who is the one who will The third question: Akramah and Issa bin Omar (Amah) is the origin, and on the authority of Ibn Kathir that he (his uncle) read the splendor of the silence, and he does not leave it.Standing, or standing and starting to wonder about the great prophet to be added (they wonder) because what is after him is explained, and he will be.(P-4) The looked question: (what) is a word that was placed for the requests of what things are things and their entitlements, she says: What is the king?What is the spirit?What is hein?What is meant is the request of what it is and the explanation of its entitlements, and that requires that of that as the one who is unjust.Then, the great thing that is its greatness and the agreement of its arrangement and the mind is miraculous to surround his being, he will be unknown, and he will be met, so he will be met, so he will be met, so he will be met, so he will be met, so he will be met.Related to what is clear and between the great thing is similar to this direction, and the similarity is one of the causes of metaphor, so this way is made (what) is a sign of the state His arrangement, and his saying is the Almighty: I do not realize what is a prisoner [the woven: 8], and what you know is what the obstacle [the country: 12] and say: Zuid and what is more.The fifth question: The question is that some of them ask each other, like the opposite, and it may also be used to talk about it, and if it is not one of them, he said: Then some of them accepted some of the they wondering, saying from them that I had two centuries to say that you are from The believers, this indicates the meaning of speaking, so the meaning of speech will be a uncle that they happen, and this is the saying of the deceased.The sixth question: Those who were wondering who they are, in which there are signs: one of them: that they are the infidels, and the evidence is upon him, the saying of God: They will know the guilt in (they ask), and (they are different), and (they will know), return to one thing, and say it: I will not know that they will not know With infidels, it was proven that the guilt is in his saying: they wonder a pioneer to the infidels, so it was said: So what you believe in his saying: they are in it.Agreed into the denial of the peasant?We said: We do not surrender that they were agreed in the denial of the wasting, and that is because some of them were those who were proven by the spiritual hostility, and they are the Christians of the Christians.As his saying: I do not think the hour is standing, and if I was returned to my Lord, I have a good manner [and I was separated: 50] and among them is the one who insists on denial, and he says: And we revive and what we are with the parties [the believers: 37], and for those who were determined by it, but it was denying the prophecy of Muhammad - -and it was lost.They were denying it, but they may have disappeared in the Kayfa of his denial, so those who were denying it because he was denying the deceased, and whoever is the one who was the one who was the one who denied it The return of the aggressor is a perpetrator of itself, and the deceased is the one who is possible for what is possible in itself, and this is what is meant by saying it: they are in it.And the second indifference: that those who were wondering are the disbelievers and the believers, and they were all wondering about it, but the Muslim is to increase the insight, and to be in the way of the religion So on the way of ridicule, or on the way to the reference of suspicions and youth.And the third indifference: that they were asking the Messenger, and they said: What is this that we promised from the last matter?As for the saying of the Almighty: about the great prophecy, it is in its books: the first question: the interpreters mentioned in the interpretation of the great prophecy, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is: The closeness is indicated by his faces: one of them: his saying: (They will know) and it is clear that what is meant by him will know this who is wondering about it, and they will not be able It is known that that is the resurrection.And the second: that it is exalted, showing it as a powerful one who is able to say it: Did we not make the earth as a gift to his saying: the day of the rituals of the rituals: It requires that he is the Almighty, but he presented this submitting to the two places of it, as well as the exalted be able to reside in the resurrection, and when the one who has proven by God, the Exalted, is the Almighty.This question has proven that the great news They were wondering about it on the Day of Resurrection.And the third of it: that the great is a name for this day with the evidence of his saying: Do you not think that they are close to the great day of the day of the people of God: 4-6] And his saying: Say: It is a great news that you are exposed to it [p.: 68,67] and because this day is the greatest of things, because that is its end, so it is the fear Specialize the name of the great with it.And the second saying: It is the Qur’an, and those who say this face with two things: The first: The great prophecy is the one who was different in it and that is the Qur’an; Because some of them made it magic and some of them poetry, and some of them said: He is the myths of the first, as for the resurrection and the prophets of Muhammad - - then they were agitated.Weak; Because we indicated that the difference was in the Baath.The second: The prophecy is the name of the news, not the name of the expert from it, so the interpretation of the Prophet in the Qur’an is first of its interpretation by the mission or the prophecy; Because this is in itself, it is not a news, but rather a news about it, and it is strengthened that the Qur’an was called remembrance, remembrance, male, guidance, guidance, and hadeeth, and a conversation Not to be from the resurrection and the prophecy.The answer to it: that if the name of the news is the most prominent of it, then the great name of the greatness is based on resurrection and the prophecy; Because there is no greatness in the conservation, but the greatness is in the suffering, and for the first to say that it is a greatness in the eloquence and the containment of the many science A fact in the bodies is metaphorical, and if the opposition is established, the rest of the indicators of the skeletons are mentioned.The third saying: that the great prophecy is the prophecy of Muhammad - -they said: And that is because when the Messenger was sent -peace and blessings be upon him -they made them: It happened?So God Almighty revealed: uncle, they wonder and that because they were surprised by the descending of God, praise be to him - peace and blessings be upon him - to them as he said: Rather, they came to them.The disbelievers are a wondrous thing [Q: 2], and they also wondered that they came to them with the neutrality as he said: Make the gods a single God, if this is an admiration [p.5] Some of them are on the way to the admiration of his saying: when they wonder.The second question: In the way of contacting this verse, by its faces: one of them: it is the saying of the Basrin that his saying: a uncle of the words of the words, he said: Great and appreciation: they wonder about the great prophecy, except that they are deleted in the second verse; Because his obtaining it in the first verse is indicated by it.And the second: that it is his saying: about the great prophecy, they are connected to what is before it, and the appreciation: when they wonder about the great prophet who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in it He was confused about what he accepted from the interrogation, as he is connected to him, and like Tarjah and Bayan for him, as he read in his saying: (What are you died, and we are dirty, and we are dirty) [Al -Saffat: 16] Bruising a thousand from others; Because their denials were for the resurrection, but when he appeared in the first words, he was confined to it, so this is so.And the third of it: It is the choice of the Kufi that the second verse is connected to the first on the estimation of “for anything that they wonder about the great prophecy” and uncle as if it is in the meaning of this Farah.
