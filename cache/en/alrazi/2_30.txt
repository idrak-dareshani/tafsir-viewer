Adam, then this is the third blessing from those general blessings that I want in this position and then in it the questions: (p-147) Say: One of them is that it is an increased link, but the Arabs are accustomed to speaking with it, and the Qur’an has descended in the language of the Arabs.The second: It is the truth that it is not in the Qur’an what is not meaningful, and it is based on the addition of remembrance, and the meaning: Remember to them, your Lord said to the angels, and this is the same: Known.The second: that God Almighty has revealed that in a lot of positions as his saying: And remember a back brother when he warned his people with the endowment: 17] And, for example, the companions of the village, when the messengers came to them, when we sent them two two [Yass: 13, 14] and the Qur’an is all the words of the one, and there is no one, and there is no distance The explicit positions came down before this surah, so there is no crime that is left that, so we have been satisfied with that expression, the owner of the scout said: * * * The ghost and threw its movement on what accepted it as a request for lightness for the abundance of its recovery.And the attachment of the vituration to the inheritance of the collection.The third question: It is among the people who said: The words in the angels are notified that it is presented to the words in the

messengers [Al -Baqara: 285] and he said: God is with him.The second: The king is a medium between God and between the Messenger in Tabalj Al -Hayyah and Al -Sharaism, so he was presented to the Messenger, and among the people who said: The words in the Prophet in the Prophet The angels; Because there is no way for us to the knowledge of the angels with the mind, but by hearing, the words in the prophets were originally to speak in the angels, so there is no generosity The prophets, and the first to be said: the king is before the Prophet with honor and the high, and after it in our minds and insulting us according to our prayers with our thoughts.Know that there is no dispute between The minds that the arrangement of the rank of the high world is the existence of the angels in it, as the honor of the arrangement for the lower scientist is the existence of the human being in it, except that the human being is in it, except that the human being is in it, except that the human being is in it, What is the angels and their right.And the way of the doctrine of the doctrine to be said: the angels must be with self -evidents with itself, then those self are either, either it is a bias or not The angels are with a biased, so we say: one of them: that they are a gentle, air bodies, who are able to form a different form, and this is the same, and this is the same, and this is the same, and this is the same.Many Muslims.Second, the saying of a nose from the slave of the second, which is that the angels are the truth in these shawls, who are described by happiness and sensitivity, for it is with their grace, The courses, including the angels of mercy, and the crushers, including the angels of torment.And the third of it: the saying of the greatest of the mangain and the enemies, which is that this world is compounded by two eternal origins, which are the light and the shadow, and they are in the truth.Difficulty in the soul and the image that is different, the verb and the mobilization.يُبْلِي, وجَوْهَرُ الظُّلْمَةِ عَلى ضِدِّ ذَلِكَ, ثُمَّ إنَّ جَوْهَرَ النُّورِ لَمْ يَزَلْ يُوَلِّدُ الأوْلِياءَ وهُمُ المَلائِكَةُ لا عَلى سَبِيلِ التَّناكُحِ, بَلْ عَلى سَبِيلِ تَوَلُّدِ الحِكْمَةِ مِنَ The wise and the light is from the luminous, and the jewelry of darkness was still born of the people who are the ones who are the ones who are born from the slope of the shed, not on the authority Whoever made the angels (P-148) is a physical biased.The second saying: that the angels are with the same souls and it is not biased and not with bodies.The separation is the separation of its obstacles on the enemies of ripples and goodness; That is because this separation is a pure pure, it is the angels, and if it is a breach as a hardship, it is the demons.And secondly: the saying of the philosophy: It is that it is a valid one with itself and it is not the bias of the bit, and that it is a violation of the flames of the nafor I complete the power of it and the most knowledgeable of it, and that it is for the human souls a neighbor of the sunbuilding of the nons The boundaries of the ravages and the makers are our spaciousness with the lineage to our children, and from it what is not on the authority of the mobilization of the orbits, but it is angry in the knowledge of God With his fear, and this is the division of the angels who are close to the angels, and their attribution to the angels who manage the heavens As the first of those who are displaced to our spacious hedge.These two sects have agreed by the spoil on their proof, and among them is the most important types of the angels, which are the angels, the armed of this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same If the world is good, if they are good, they are the angels, and if it is a badger, they are the devils, so this is separated by the doctrine of people in the angels.And the people of science differed that, is it possible to judge it from the mind or is not a way to prove it except by hearing?As for the philosophy, they agreed that in the mind there are indications of the existence of the angels, and we have with them in that indicators, research is a distressive, distant, from the one who is a dementia, and from the one who is a distant, and from the one who is a dement Mental faces, and we will publish to it.One of them: that what is meant by the lively life that is not dead, so we say: the mental division requires the provision of three sections, for the life is that the life is either.وهو الإنْسانُ, أوْ يَكُونَ مَيِّتًا ولا يَكُونَ ناطِقًا وهو البَهائِمُ, أوْ يَكُونَ ناطِقًا ولا يَكُونَ مَيِّتًا وهو المَلَكُ, ولا شَكَّ أنَّ أخَسَّ المَراتِبِ هو المَيِّتُ غَيْرُ النّاطِقِ, وأوْسَطُها النّاطِقُ The dead, and the honorable people who are not a dead, are not dead.First.And the second: that the breakfast testifies that the world of the heavens is honored by this lower world, and it testifies that life, mind, and terminology are honored by its additions, and the absence of it.Life, mind and terminology are obtained in this unjust world, and do not get bit in that world that is the world of light, light and honorable.And the third: that the companions of the massacres, the most important of the witnesses, the people of the witnesses, and the people of the needs, and the people who have proven from the other side, which is what the wonders of their effects are seen to The strange, and the installation of the paste and the sacrifice of the creatures, and what indicates that is the state of sincere vision, so this is the face of convincing And he did not practice it, and it is a category with the lineage to the one who fled it and witnessed it and cursed its secrets.The angels, but that is like the command collected among them, and God knows.* * * The following question: In the explanation of their many: He said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: Or a kneeling, “And it was narrated that the children of Adam are the same heaven, and the children of Adam are the tenth of the domains of righteousness, and all of them are the tenth of the bird, and all of them are the tenth of the tenth of the sails Ten angels With it, and all these are the tenths of the sky of the world, and all these are the twelve heaven of the third heaven, and on this structure to the angels of the sky, then the sky, then the seed, then The angels of the Karsi are a few.And his heat, if the heavens and the lands are made with it, and what is in it and what is between it, then all of them are something easy, and a small amount, and there is no place in the place Rakh or a standing, for them is a marriage with praise and sanctification, then all these are in the interview of the angels who pray around the throne, like the diameter in the dumplings, and not Then, with the angels of the sacrifice who are the most sarcasm of peace be upon him, and the angels who are the soldiers of Gabriel, peace be upon him, and they are all of them, and they are all.They are occupied by his worshipers, his chains, and the humiliation of the people with his remembrance and his glorification, and they are affiliated with that since their creation, he does not grow up And the day, and they are not guided, do not count their gests, nor the duration of their customs, nor how their worshipers are only God Almighty, and this is the realization of the truth of his king He knows the soldiers of your Lord, but he is [Al -Muddar: 31].And I say: I saw some of the books of the memory, “He is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, when he saw him as an angel in a place in the place of the house of the market, with the time The Messenger of God ﷺ, whichever, where are they going?To him: Since you were created?A thousand times.”Glory be to him from a god who grew up his ability and what was evacuated as his money.He knew that God is glorified and exalted in the Qur’an, their varieties and descriptions, but the items: one of them: the burden of the throne, and it is his saying: and the lap [الحاقَّةِ: 17].And the second: the barefoot around the throne on what they said: The angels see those who are barefoot from the throne, praising the praise of their Lord [Al -Zamer: 75].And the third of it: the angels of the angels.An enemy for the disbelievers [Al -Qarra: 98] Then it is his pneumators, and he described Gabriel, peace be upon him, with matters: The first: that he is the friend of the righteous, who said: On your heart [Al -Shua’ar: 193, 194].The second: It is the highest mentioned before the wickedness of the angels In the Qur’an, say: Whoever is an enemy of Jabril [Al -Baqarah: 97] and because Gabriel is the owner of the revelation and the knowledge, and the Mikiil of the owner of the livelihood and the feeding, and the knowledge of the soul is the one who is the good The Jasbian food, so Jabriel should be honored by Michael.The third: He is the Almighty, he made it a second himself, for God is his money and Gabriel, and the right of the believers [Al -Taraim: 4].The lord: The Spirit of Jerusalem called it, he said in the right of Jesus, peace be upon him: I supported you with the spirit of Jerusalem [Al -Maaidah: 110].Fifth: He will support the guardians of God, and he will make his enemies with a thousand of the angels.Sixth: He is the highest of his praise with six in his saying: He said a generous messenger with a powerful person when the throne is an ancient place, then a mother of the mother [21] His sending is that he is the Messenger of God ﷺ to all the prophets, so all (P-150) the prophets and the messengers of his nation and his generosity to his Lord that he made him and his slave between him The prophet, and his strength was that he raised the peer of the people of Lot to the sky and turned it, and his place for God is that he made him the second of himself in the saying of God: And Gabriel and the validity of the believers [Al -Tahimim: 4], and his being is obedient that he is the imam of the angels and their imitator, and as for his mother, he is a saying: He said: Let the warnings be [the poets: 193-194], and from the sentences of the angels of the angels, the Sarville and Azaril, may God’s prayers be upon them, and they have been established, By the news that Azaril is the king of death on what he said: Say: You will die the king of the death, who is entrusted to you [the prostration: 11] and the saying of it: Our messengers passed away [Al -Anam: 61], so that it is indicated by the presence of angels, who are entrusted to the tribes of the soul The signs of the exaltation said: If you see, when those who disbelieve the angels pass away, they will strike their faces and their ads [Anfal: 50].As for the Sarafel, peace be upon him, the news was indicated that he was the owner of the pictures of what the Almighty said: We were blown in the pictures, so he was stuck in the heavens and whoever is in the land of God If they are a resurrection, they see [Al -Zamer: 68].And its elevation: the angels of paradise said: The angels are entered by them from every chapter, peace be upon you, with what you have been patient, so we are the best of the house [Al -Ra’dh: 23].Fifth: The angels of the fire said: It has a tenth of nineteenth [the consequences: 30] and the Almighty said: We did not make the people of the fire except your angels [the one who is the one] His Excellency said: And they called you, so that your Lord will destroy us [Al -Zakharf: 77] and the names of their sentences Zabaniya said: Let his club be called.And its sixth: who are assigned to the children of Adam For his words: On the authority of Yumin, and on the north, he is not said of what he said, except for him, a good nickname [Q17, 18] and his saying: He has a punishment for him.They memorize him from the command of God [Al -Ra’da: 11] and his saying is the Almighty: He is the one who is on the authority of his servants and sends you a memorization [Al -Anam: 61].And its sake: the book of the work, which is the saying of the Almighty: If you have a preservative, they have a clerk who know what you do [breakfast: 10-12].And eighth: those who are assigned to this world, and they are the ones who are said by the Almighty: Al -Safat is a description [Safaat: 1] and his saying: and the virginity of the anchors: [1] The divisions are an order [the aartis: 4] and its saying: and the disputes are divorced [the disputes: 1].And on the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: God has an angel, only the memorizers, they write what he falls from the tenderness of the trees, so if one of you is a fierceness with the land of the land, then the Lord of the people: May God have mercy on you.* * * As for the descriptions of the angels, it is one of them: one of them: that the angels are the messengers of God.A messenger [Hajj: 75], this indicates that some angels are the messengers only, and his answer is that “from“ to the two people, not to be met.And the second: their proximity to God Almighty, and that is obeyed to be in the place and the destination, and it remains only that this is the proximity of the proximity, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who says: They do not grow up from his worshipers [the Prophet: 19] and his saying: Rather, the servants are honored [Al -Anbiya: 26] and his saying: They praise the night and the day, and the day is not.Their obedience, and that is from his faces: The first: His saying is a story about them, and we praise your praise and sanctify you and said to you and said in another position: (p-151) Let us praise the praise [Safat: 165-166], and God Almighty has lied to them in that, and they have proven with them to worship them.The second: their recession to comply with the command of God is great for him, and he is his saying: all the angels glorified all of them.[Al -Hijar: 30].The third: They do nothing except with his life and his command, and he said: They do not precede him by saying and they are in his command they do [27].And its booster: the description of their ability and that is from the faces: the first: that the bearer of the throne while they are eight are the burden and the chair, then the chair that is the one who is the most The seven heavens, because of his saying: His chairs expanded the heavens and the earth [Al -Qar: 255] So look at the end of their ability and their strength.The second: that the throne is something that the illusion does not surround and it is indicated by his saying: the angels and the spirit are brought up to him on a day that was the one who is a fool of Fifth.[4] They are for the severity of their ability to get off from one moment Whoever is in the heavens and who is in the land except for those who want God and then blow in it the last, then if they are a resurrection, they look [Al -Zamer: 68], so the owner of the pictures is informed in the power to the power of the power Those in the heavens and the earth are stunned, and with the second blow from it, they will come back.Know the greatness of this power.And the quarter: that Gabriel, peace be upon him, reached in his strength until he fell in the mountains of Lot, and their country was one batch.Fifth: and describing their fear and indicating his faces: the first: that they are with many of their worshipers and their feet on the serenity As if their worshipers are my tnoms, the Almighty said: They fear their Lord from their surnames [Al -Nahl: 50] and he said: They are from his fear of encoding [Al -Anbiya: 28].The second: His Excellency said: Even if their hearts are removed from their hearts, they said what your Lord said, they said the truth, and he is the greatest of the great [Saba: 23] narrated in the interpretation that God is up to God.The people of the heavens heard it, such as the voice of the seedlings, on the grace, so they will be lost.They said: The truth is the great, the great.The third: Al -Bayahqi narrated in “The People of Faith” on the authority of Ibn Abbas, who said: “Between the Messenger of God ﷺ with a side, and with him Jabril, when he founded the heavens of the heavens, then the heavens of the heavens And some of it will enter one another, and they are indifferent to the earth, so if a king, he will be like between the hands of the Messenger of God ﷺ He said: O Muhammad, that your Lord will read you and the peace of the peace A prophet as a king and between that you are a prophet as a servant, peace be upon him: He referred to Jabriel in his hand to be humiliated, so I know that he was a good man, so he said, and he said: That king is to the sky, so I said: O Jabril, I wanted to ask you about this, so I saw from your condition that I did not occupy me from the question.God, the day of his creation between his hands, is clear, and he does not raise his kindness, and between the Lord and between him seventy lights, there is no light from it The reward, if God authorized him in something of heaven or from the earth, will benefit from that inspiration with the closeness of his forehead Michael, he commanded him, and if he did the king of death, I said: O Jabriel.I said: On any thing, the king of death?And know that it is not after the words of God and the words of His Messenger are words in the description of the angels higher and more than the words of the Commander of the Faithful, upon him, peace be upon him, he said: Between the heavens, the loudness of them, so they filled out the phases of angels, so some of them are prostrated, and they do not kneel, and a kneeling that they do not persist, and they are not so they do not.Eyes, no soreness of the minds, nor the abundance of the eternity, nor the forgiveness of the forgetfulness, and among them are the people of his life and the Sunnah to his messengers, and they are disagreeing with the judgment of his rule For his worshipers, and the dates of the doors of his paradise, and from them the constant in the lands (P-152), the lower feet, and the ritual of the high sky, and the one from the heavens, and the one from the trains, and the one from the trails, For the dignity of the throne, their shoulders, without their eyes, they are fools with their weapons, they are tired between them and among those without them, the veil of the glory, not Their Lord is delusional with parallel, and they do not conduct the characteristics of the varieties, and they do not limit it to the fish, and they do not refer to it with regulations.* * * The fifth question: they disagreed that what is meant is from his saying: When your Lord said to the angels that I am making in the earth, let alone all the angels, or with them.Abbas that he was glorified and exalted, but he said this saying to the angels who were fighting with Balsis, because God is exalted, when he dwelt the earth, and the earth is the same Some of them killed each other, God sent a Palis in a soldier from the angels, and he killed them with his hearts until they were removed from the land, and they were brought up.Come on: I am in the land.The most of the companions and the two companions said: It is the Almighty said that to the group of angels, without specialization; Because the angels are notified, it is the public, so the specialization is the disagreement of the original.The sixth question: make it make whoever made it an effective, he entered the beginning and the news, and it is his saying: on the ground, a successor, so we were active, and we are in the same way Khalifa.The following question: The phenomenon is that the earth that is in the verse is all the earth from the outskirt Mecca, and the angels were floating around the house, and they are the first to those who circumvented it, and it is in the land that God Almighty said: I am making in the land a successful land.The eighth question: The caliphate is the one who succeeds others and takes his place.And remember when he made you a successor [Al -Araf: 69], but what is meant by the successor who?So he said: One of them is that he is the same as peace be upon him.And he said: I make it in it who spoils the meter of his offspring, not he.The second: that he was born, as for those who said: What is the intention of Adam, peace be upon him.And they mentioned it in it: The earth was a caliph of peace for those who are the gin who they presented, narrated from Ibn Abbas.The second: God called him a successor; Because God is inherent in the judgment between the costs of his creation, and he is the narrator of Ibn Masoud, Ibn Abbas, and Al -Saddi, and this is the opinion of you.A caliph in the land, so that you will be among the people with the right [p.26].Because they succeeded each other, and it is the saying of goodness and confirmed by his saying: He is the one who made you the caliphs of the land [Al -Anam: 165], and the successor is the name of the name of the name As it is reconciled to the male and the female, and it is read by the endowment, then it was said: What is good in God said the Almighty to the angels: I am in the land of the earth with a successor with the righteous Mix?The answer is from two voices: the first: that he knew that if they appeal to that secret, and they will have that question, so the reconciliation was required, then the answer is that they were surrounded, so the answer is that they were surrounded by the answer.This is the case for you to repeat that question and hear that answer.The second face: He highly taught his worshipers.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: They said, I will make it to the end of the verse, so it has questions: the first question: the greatest of the scholars of the religion, they agreed upon all of the people of the religion.All sins, and from the stuffing whoever is afraid in that and we have faces: (P-153) The first: His Exalted say: Do not disobey God, what they command and do what they do: This verse is specialized in the angels of the fire, so if we want the general connotation, we will hold us with the words of His Excellency: they fear their Lord from their understanding and do what they do [50] His saying: They do what they command all of the actions of the commandments and the left of the prohibitions; Because the one who is forbidden is a matter of its blessing, then it was said: What is the evidence that he said: and they do what they command to benefit the general?We said: Because there is nothing from the commandments, except that the discretion is valid from it, and the discretion is removed from the words that God has to enter into what he has shown in the origin of the jurisprudence.The second: His Excellency said: Rather, they are honored servants who do not precede him by saying, and they are in his command.Standing in all matters, except with the necessity of the matter and the life.And the third: He transcended them that they stabbed in the human beings with disobedience, and if they were from the stick, they would not have good.The lord: He is transcendent from them that they praised the night and the day, and they do not break, and whoever was like that, he forbids the breasts of disobedience from it, and the absence of it is the one: On the authority of them, they said: I will make it in it who spoils in it and shed blood We praise your praise and sanctify you, and this requires the breasts of the sin about them, and it is indicated by it.The greatest sins.And the second: that they stabbed in the children of Adam with corruption and murder, and that is absent, and the absence of sins.And the third of it: that after they were stabbed in the children of Adam, they praised themselves with their saying: and we praise your praise and sanctify you, and they said: “And they said: Praise [Al-Saffat: 165-166] and this is for the confinement, as if they were exhausted, as they are otherwise, as well Peace: ("Three of the Magic, and he mentioned the admiration of the woman with itself." And he said: Do not be zakat yourself [Al -Najam: 32].And its elevation: that their saying: There is no knowledge of us, unless you taught us, the apology is likened to, and if only the sin will be presented, otherwise they would not be able to excuse.Fifthly: that his saying: They told me with the names of these if you are true [Al -Baqara: 31] indicates that they were liars, as they said it first.And its sixth: that his saying: I did not say to you that I know the absence of heavens and the earth, and I know what you look Before this location, and that they were complaining in the universe of God, a scholar of all information.And the sake of it: that their knowledge spoils and shed blood, either that it has been obtained by the revelation to them in that or they said it, the first, and the first, and the first; Because if God reveals the Almighty to them, it was not for the return of that words that are extensive, and it was proven that they said it about the tubes and the righteousness, and the righteousness of the ritual Obtained; To say it to the Almighty: Do not stop what you do not have knowledge [Al -Asra: 36] and he said: The thought does not enrich anything from the truth [Al -Najam: 28].And the eighth: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, what he said: God is glorified and exalted.So the angels said, "He has the right to him: (P-154).It was narrated from hein and a mortality that God is exalted, when he took in the creation of Adam, the angels whispered between them and said: Let our Lord be created, as he wants to create, and he will not create He grew up from him and honored him, and when he created Adam, peace be upon him, he preferred them and he taught Adam all the names, then he presented them to the angels, so he said: You were honest [Al -Baqara: 31] that I do not create creation except that you are better than him, so the people are lost when that to the tabaa and said: The narratives that when they said: I will make it in it, God sent them a fire and burned them.The second suspicion: they were held by the cut of Harbot and Marott, and they claimed that they were owners of the angels, and that they are not aware of what the people of the lands are manufactured And they called on the people of the earth, so God Almighty revealed to them that if I had your slander, what I have been broken by the children of Adam from the desires, and he said: O Lord, and he said: So we were tired, so they gave them to the earth and walked them with the lusts of the children of Adam, so they stayed in the land, and God commanded the cousin that is called the flower and the king of the king The flower was made in the image of a woman and the king in the image of a man, then the flower took a hose and decorated itself and called them to the soul of it, Her house in the example of a idol, so they kissed to its homes and called it to the obscene, so they refused to them except to drink wine.Then they called her to that, and she said: I remained a summary that I could not do until you do it, they said: What is it?She said: You prostrate to this idol, and they said: We do not share with God, then the desire dominated them, and they said: We do, then we seek forgiveness, so they will be forgiven The flower and its king to their position from the sky, so they know then that it was affected by that with the causes of the sons of Adam, and in the last narration that it was the one who was The earth, but it was made after the drinking of the wine, and killed the soul, and prostrated to the idol, and the great name that they was in the name was brought up to the sky, so the heavens, so the heavenly And she went to the sky, and God molded her and he was filled with this coin called the flower, then God Almighty defined Harbout and Marott, what is in it.The hereafter is later and between the torment of the world urgently, so he triggered the torment of the world, so he made them with the door of those who are in a well to the day of resurrection, and they know the people of the magic He went to that position to learn the magic in particular, and hang in that with the words of the Almighty: and follow what the two tenders recite on the king of Silman: 102.The third suspicion: that the Pliss was one of the angels close to the angels, then he disobeyed God Almighty and disbelieved, and that indicates the breasts of disobedience.The lobby: His Excellency said: We did not make the companions of the fire except an angel [the developed: 31] they said: This is indicated that the angels are tormented, because the righteous are not the people of Whoever is tormented in it as he said: Those are the people of the fire in which they are immortal and the answer to the first suspicion is to say: As for the first face, which is their saying: They have been subjected to God Almighty, and this is one of the greatest sins, so we say: It is not their abuse from that question that God will be alert A disbeliever, nor denial of God is exalted in a verb, but he is intended for that question.He does a verb that does not stand on the face of the wisdom in it, and he says to him: Do this do this as if he admires the words of his ruling and his knowledge, and he says: It spoils from the things that the minds do not guarantee in the face It is upon him, so what is the greatest of your rule and the best of your knowledge, so what has said that he said: I will make it in it who spoils it as if he liked the knowledge of the knowledge of God On all the minds.And the second: that the revenue of the forms is a request for the answer that is not warned, as if they said: Our God is the wise who does not do the foolishness, and we see that we see in The fool is a fool, then if you create a people, they will be spoiled and killed and you are with your knowledge that their condition is like that, you created them, and you have been able to do so, and what is forbidden to do so.The absolute, how can the collection be among the two things?As if the angels wanted this question as a request for the answer, and this is the dismissed answer.The people of justice are gone, they said: The one who confirms this answer and Jahan: one of them: they added corruption and shed blood to the creatures, not to the Creator.The second: that they said: We praise your praise and sanctify you because the praise is eager to the same from the description of the bodies, and the mastery is eager.And the third of it: that the evil, even if it is a crime of this lower scientist, is only from the balance of the good in it, and its goodness is overwhelmed by its evil, and the abundance of the good, and leaving the good, The few evil is a lot of evil, for the angels mentioned those evils, so God Almighty answered them with his saying: I know what you do not know that the goodness is that The lower is more than the evil in it, and the wisdom requires finding what this matter does not leave it, and this is the answer to the rule.And he pushed it: that their question was on the face of the exaggeration in the greatness of God, so that the worshiper is the stretching of his love for his money, and he will be hidden to him.Fifth: that the angels say: I will make it in it who spoils a question from them to make the earth or some of them for them if that is a good, so they said: “They said:“ They said: “They said:“ They said: Make the earth to us, not for them, as Moses, peace be upon him, said: Do we give us what the fools did from us [Al -Araf: 155] and the meaning does not destroy us, so he said: I know what you know.These are those who made them in the land, so he showed that he had chosen the sky for them in particular, and for the earth, especially for his knowledge, with the goodness God is for him.Sixth: that they asked the wisdom for which they created them with this corruption and killing.And its sake: Al -Qafal said that it is impeded that God is exalted when he told them that he made in the land a successful land, he said: “Do you make it in it, that is, you will do so, then it is a positive thing.” Jarir: You are the best of those who installed the lines and the two worlds have become a stomach, that is, you are like that, and if he was a sense of them, he would not be a praise, then you said: And we are with this, praise your praise and sanctify, when we know that you do not do only the right and the wisdom, so when they said that, God Almighty said: And God knows - yes, what you did, where you did not make that, and you will be ever been in my rule, for I know what you do not know, for you have known, and I have known them I know their appearance and their inner (P-156), so I know from their homes, hidden secrets and wisdom in the language that requires their creation and finding them.As for the second direction: that they mentioned the children of Adam in the absence of the absence, the answer is that the place of forms is in the creation of the children of Adam.It is exposed to the place of forms, not for others, for this reason they mentioned from the children of Adam, these two classes, and what they mentioned of them are their worshipers and their uniforms; Because that is not the place of forms.As for the third face: that they praised themselves, and that requires the wonder and the soul of the soul.The answer: that the praise of the soul is not different from it, divorced to say: As for the grace of your Lord, he spoke [Al -Duha: 11] We praise your praise and sanctify you that what is meant is the praise of the soul, but what is meant by the way is that this question is what we want to praise you in the ruling of you And we recognize you with divine and judgment, as if the excess of that is that they did not want the question to seek help in wisdom and divinity, but rather to seek the face of the face.As for the faster face: that they say: there is no knowledge of us except what you have taught [the cow: 32], the apology is similar to that of the predecessor of sins, our saying: The angels may not repeat that question, and when you left this first, that apologize was an apology from the first leaving [The Prophet: 27] This question must be with the permission of God Almighty, and if they are hurt in this question, then how can they apologize for it?Our general said that specialization will be made.As for the fifth face: that the news of the angels about corruption and the shedding of blood, either that it is obtained from the revelation, or they said it as a man who said: They mentioned that thought, then they mentioned in it and Jahin: The first: and it is narrated from Ibn Abbas and Al -Kalbi that they had measured him in the state of the gin who were the one who was the one who was before.The second: They knew his creation and know that it is compounded by this four mixtures, so it is imperative that it is committed to the lust and the anger, so the corruption is from the corruption, so the corruption is from the corruption.And the shedding of blood from the anger, and among them who said: They said that on the jungle, which is narrated from Ibn Masoud and people of the companions, then they mentioned it: For the angels: I am making a caliph, they said: Our Lord, and what is that Khalifa?He said: He will have an offspring that spoils in the land and is envious, and some of them kill each other, so then they said: Our Lord will make it in it?.And the second: that he was the highest that the angels had known that if there was a great creation, they spoiled in it and shed the blood.And the third of it: Ibn Zaid said when God created the high fire, the angels feared severe fear, and they said: Our Lord, whoever created this fire?He said to whom I have been from my creation, and there was no creation for God except the angels, and in the land there was no creation, so when he said: I am in the land of the earth.They appear from them.And the sequence of it: When the pen wrote in the inspiration, what is to be to the Day of Resurrection, so perhaps they see the wave, so they know that.Fifth: If the meaning of the caliph is the one who is a deputy to God Almighty in the judgment and the judiciary, and the righteousness to the ruler and the judge, but it will be with the conflict and the shadow, it was for the sake of the people.On the authority of corruption and evil with the way (P -157) commitment, the people of investigations said: And the saying that this was the one who is the deceased - is false; Because he is a praise in others that he will not be safe to be a liar in it, and that is to contradict the infallibility and the flower.As for the sixth face: it is the news that they mentioned, as it is the chapter on the news of the ones, so do not oppose the evidence that we mentioned.As for the second suspicion: it is the story of Harbot and Marut, the answer to it is that the story that they mentioned is invalid from the face I was brought up with what I have seen with the children of Adam, I have disobeyed me, so they said: If you did that, Lord, we would not have disobeyed you The infidels, and the brutality, greeted them, were before the dowry to the ground.And the second: In the story, they are good between the torment of the world and the torment of the hereafter, and that is a pardon, but rather it was the first to choose between the repentance, and between the torment, and between the torment, and between the torment, and between the good, and between the torment, and between the good, and between the torment of the His life was long and in the abuse of his prophets.And the third: In the story, they know the magic if they are tormented and invited to him while they are punished for disobedience.And its booster: that the immoral woman is how it is reasonable that it was when she went up to the sky, and God Almighty made it a luminous and great, and he said: I swear by the ghost of the jaws, it is the severity of the rituals: the story of this story is a story that is witnessed by every mind of Silim, with the ritual of the ritual, The magic will come to the interpretation of that verse in its position, if God Almighty wills.As for the third suspicion: it was speaking in Bayan that the Bliss was of the angels.As for the semi -luxury: It is its saying: We did not make the people of the fire except an angel [the developed: 31], this does not indicate their being tortured in the fire: The owners of the fire are in it, they are immortal [Yunus: 27], as well as they are not to be tormented by the fire with the incest of this verse, but rather, but it is a matter He said it: We did not make the companions of the fire except an angel [the impact: 31] He wants the treasury of the fire and the displaced people in it and those who are arranged for its command, and God knows best.* * * He said the philosophy of the philosophy and many of the people of al -Jabr: They are cure and no destiny for them to be bitter on the evil and corruption.And he said: “The two and many of the jurisprudence are fired, and they are in the past and begging for that with its wings: one of them: that they said:“ Do you make it in it.A disobedience or the first leaving and on the two estimates, so what is meant is.And the second: His Excellency said: Whoever says from them is that I am a god without it, so we will be rewarded with Hell.They arrogate from his worshipers [Al -Araf: 206], and the praise is to kneel the arrogance, but it is permissible, even if he was able to do the arrogance.And the third of it: that if they were not able to leave the good, they would not be extended by its actions, because the refuge is to the thing, and whoever does not appreciate it With the verb of that thing, and this has been inferred with some of the disgraceful, so I said to him: Isn't that the reward and the compensation and the cherbet of God Almighty?And the meaning of his universe is obligatory for him that if he left it, he would have left it either ignorant or the need, and they are referred, and the one who is referred to the referred is referred to, so it will be That is the blessing of God Almighty, and if the blessing is referred, the verb is obligatory, then God will be an active act for the reward, and the compensation is obligatory and the leaving of it is referred to it.Doing that, so she proven that the abuse of the blessing is not praised in (P-158), the praise of the praise, and it was cut off, and what was capable of the answer.* * * The third question: Waw in and we are in the case as you say: I improve to so -and -so and I have the right to kindness, and the praise is the distance of God, the Almighty, and the water is from And he was sanctified in the land if he went in it and distanced, and know that the distance is that I want the distance from the bad, then it is praise, and if I want it, then it is for the sake of the good So we say: The distance from the bad is in which the distance from the misfortune in the self, the adjectives and the acts, but in the self, it is not a place for it to be a place for it, for it is a place for it, for it is a place for it, for it is a place for it, for it is a place for it, for it is a place for it, for it is the place The numbers, and the negation of the possibility is required to deny the many, and its exile is obligated by the negation of the body and the arrival, the exile of the opposite, the peer, and the arrival of the one, And the sky, and in the adjectives, it will be a balance of ignorance, so it will be surrounded by all information, and it is able to all the destinations, and it will be the attributes of the attributes The changes, but in the verbs, it is not that its actions are not for the sake of the benefits and the payment of the harms, and that it is not completed with anything from them, and it does not diminish from it, so it is from it.All of the struggles and hostilities, as a result of numbers and creation on all the struggles and hostages, and the people of the memorial said: The praise came in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an in the Qur’an In the sense of admiration.As for the first, he came to faces: (a) I am the one who is out of the counterpart and the partners, it is God, the one who is the one.(B) I am the mastermind of the heavens and the earth, the Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the earth.(C) I am the mastermind of all the two worlds, the Glory of God, Lord of the two worlds.(D) I am the one who is the one who says the unjust, the Lord of your Lord, the Lord of Glory, with what they describe.(E) I am the one who is the one who is the one who is the rich.(F) I am the Sultan, who is not like me, so it is under my hearts and slopes, so they will be given to him.(G) I am the scientist with everything.Glory be to God for what they describe the world of the unseen.(H) I am the one who is the one who has the companion and the father, they will be a son.(I) I am the one who is in their description and their saying, they will be granted and exalted what they share, when they say, what they describe.As for the admiration, as well as: (A) I am the one who mocked the strong of the weak preaching, Glory be to the one who mocked us this.) (C) I am the one who knows, not by learning the teachers, nor by the guidance of guidance, they will not know you, but what you taught us.(D) I am the one I remove the disobedience of the seventy years with the wiping of an hour, so praise the praise of your Lord before the sun was lost, then he says: If you want the pleasure of God And in the first place, and if you want the vineyard from the calamity, then praise, there is no god, you will be blessed.You are satisfied, and if you want salvation from the fire, praise, greet you, and we are the torment of the fire, O servant, and persevere in my praise, so they will be blessed, and God bless him Speaking to me, the harm is to you; Because I have to praise me, and among them is the burden of the throne, if you are arrogant, then those who have your Lord praise [and separated: 38] and among them are the close ones, they said: 41] And among them is the bird of the angels.I seek to you [Al -Araf: 143] and the companions praised in his saying: Glory be to you, and we are the torment of the fire [Al -Amran: 191] and everyone praises and from them, and the wasting of the downsides He praises his praise [Al -Asra: 44], as well as the stone, the length, the sand, the mountains, the night, the day, the unjust, the lights, the paradise, the fire, the time, the place, the supporter, the place, the arms, the aroma, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the places, the arms, the lights, the places, the place, the light, the light, the day, the day, the light, the light, the light, the day.God has what is in the heavens [Al-Hadid: 1] Then he says: (P-159) O servant: I am the rich from the praise of these things, and these things are not from the life of this The praise, the reward for this praise has become lost, and that is not worthy of me and what we created the heavens and the earth and what is between them is invalid [p.27], but I am the reward of these things Let each one know that those who worked hard in my servants, make all the world in his servants.And the last of the year, remind me of the slave to benefit from it, not, I am Glory be to your Lord, Lord of Glory And they praised him with a misery and an authenticity [Al -Ahbab: 42] A good loan, and he will be doubled for him [Al -Hadid: 11] Be appointed to me, and if I was rich in your help, and may God be the soldiers of the heavens and the earth [the conquest: 4] God bless them, and he will be victorious from them [Muhammad: 4], but if you support me, I will help you if you support God, he will help you [Muhammad: 7] Be a remembrance of the remembrance of God [Al -Baqarah: 203] There is no need for me to mention you; Because everyone remembers me, and if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say to God [Laqman: 25], but if you remember me, I remember you.[Al -Baqara: 152] Say: O people, worship your Lord.And for God, whoever finds those in the heavens and the earth [the thief: 15], but he was pleased with my servants, these few days, to obtain the many rest of them.[91] * * * The following question: His saying: With your praise, the owner of the scouts said: Your praise is in the position of the situation, that is, we praise you for you, and you will be blessed with you.Fifth and Jahan: The first: If we praise you, we will be granted to you.The second: We praise you with your praise, for if it is not for you to be overwhelmed by the success, we could not be able Thank you for your blessing except with your blessings, so God Almighty revealed to him: “Now you have thank you, where you know that all of me are from me, and the scholar is different from this “Abu Dharr entered the guarantee of the Messenger of God ﷺ or by the opposite, so he said, O Messenger of God, in my father, you and my mother: Which of the words I love to God?God and his praise, “Narrated by a Muslim, and Said bin Jabir narrated that he said:“ The Prophet was praying, and a man from the Muslims passed by a man from the one who said: God prayed and you are sitting and not praying, so he said to him: Go to your work if you have a work, so he said: I only think I will pass on you whoever denys you, and he said: The Messenger of God prayed and you are sitting, so he said to him like it, and he has proven to him and struck him.The Messenger of God from his prayers rose to him, Omar, and he said: O Prophet of God Your work, so the prayers and peace be upon him: Did you strike his neck.Wisdom, God has in the heavens, angels, he has a richness with their prayers for the prayer of Flas, so Omar said, O Messenger of God, and what are their prayers?So he did not return anything on him, and Jabriel brought him, so he said: O Prophet of God, I asked you about the prayer of the people of the heavens?He said: Yes.The day (P-1660) is the resurrection they say: Glory be to the pride and the mighty, and the people of the third sky are kneeling to the Day of Resurrection They say: Glory be to the living that does not die, for this is the praise of the angels.The second saying: that what is meant by his saying: we praise any origin and praise is the prayer, and it is the saying of Ibn Abbas and Ibn Mas'oud.* * * The fifth question: the manifestation of purification, and from it the sanctified land, then they disagreed with its faces: one of them: we purify you, that is, your half of what is with you.And the second: the saying of Mujahid: We purify our souls from our sins and our sins, abolishing your illness.And the third of it: the saying of my father, a Muslim, who purifies our actions from our sins until you are pure for you.And the sequence of them: We purify our hearts from the fools to others until they are exposed to the lights of your knowledge.The disgrace said: This verse indicates justice from its face It was a verb for God, as well as the good praise of that, and there is no preference for that to the shedding of blood; For all of that is the act of God Almighty.And the second: If corruption and killing would have been action for God, it would have been that the answer would be to say: I am your money, and I do whatever I want.And the third: that his saying: I know what you do not know, it requires justification from corruption and killing, but the righteousness of itself is referred.ورابِعُها: إذا كانَ لا فاحِشَةَ ولا قُبْحَ ولا جَوْرَ ولا ظُلْمَ ولا فَسادَ إلّا بِصُنْعِهِ وخَلْقِهِ ومَشِيئَتِهِ, فَكَيْفَ يَصِحُّ التَّنْزِيهُ والتَّقْدِيسُ?Fifth: that his saying: I know what you do not know, indicating the justice of justice; Because if he was an immortal of disbelief, he would have created them for that disbelief, so he would have been in the way that the answer would be blessed by their creation, so that they could be spoiled, and they would not be killed.This gold fell.And its sixth: If corruption and killing were of the action of God, the Almighty would have been on the running of their colors and their bodies, and it is not valid from this, so that this is the same, so that this is the same, so that this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the murder of this.The answer to this face, which is opposed to the question of the preacher and knowledge, and God knows.* * * The sixth question: If it is said: Its saying: I know what you do not know how to be a answer to the question that they mentioned?We said: It was mentioned that the question began with its faces: one of them: that it is like it, so it will be his saying: I know what you do not know, as it is for him to say: There is a person who spoils and kills, so I know with this that they have a group of righteous and righteous, and you do not know.And the second: It is for the minor, so the answer is not to be overlooked by the existence of the spoilers, so I also know that there is a group of the righteous, and whoever is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.And the third of it: that he asked the wisdom, so his answer is that your reconciliation is in it that you know the face of the rule in it on the scope without detailing, but it was the same.It is spoiled for you.And the one that is: it is the sympathy; Because he left them in the land and his answer: I know that you are reconciled to be in the sky, not in the earth, and in it a fifth face: which is that when they said: We have said: Hope: I know what you do not know, which is that you are a Pellis, and that in his heart he is envy, old and hypocrisy.And a sixth face: that I know what you do not know, because when you described you for these swimmelies, you have grown up with you, so you are in you No in my praise, but be patient until the human beings appear, and they will be brought to God with their saying: Our Lord is our injustice, for our souls [Al -Araf: 23] My sin [the poets: 82] and his saying: and enter me with your mercy in your righteous worshipers [Al -Nmal: 19].(P-161) Adam taught all the names, then he presented them to the angels, so he said: They told me with the names of these these if you are true to the saying of the Almighty: On the angels, he said, tell me about the names of these if you are honest, I know that the angels when they asked about the face of the rule in the creation of Adam The earth, and God Almighty told the face of the rule in that on the way of the bumps by saying the Almighty: I know what you do not know The polem is, so the Almighty has shown the grace of peace be upon him, and it was not from that knowledgeable to them, and that is that he taught the names of all of them, then they are the same, then they are the same This is like the honor of his grace and their shortness of it in knowledge, so that the total answer is confirmed by this detailed answer, and we are the questions: the one who said: The languages ​​are all metaphorical, in the sense that God Almighty created a fierce knowledge of those provisions, and those suffering, and that these righteousness is a place for me.With his words, he said: Adam taught all the names, and the words on holding this verse as a question and an answer that we mentioned in the origins of jurisprudence.Abo Hashem said: It is necessary to provide a language of transitions, and it is needed that it is imperative that the place be preceded by the bumps: Al -Dhuri that it is the Almighty, put this word for this meaning, so that knowledge is either to obtain the sane or for the sake of the sane person, and it is not permissible for a sake to get it.Because if the science of the frying sciences obtained that it was the same as the memorial of that meaning, the attribute of God is based on the knowledge of the same This is referred, and it is not permissible to get the sane person; Because it is excluded in the minds that the knowledge of these languages ​​will obtain with the wondrous wisdom in them, other than the sane.She proven that the saying is pardoned.And the second: He is the Almighty, which addressed the angels, and that must be provided for a language on that spoke.And the third of it: that his saying and the Adam of the names all of them requires the addition of the learning to the names, and that is required in that names that it was the names of that The languages ​​were before that learning.And its elevation: that peace be upon him, when the angels are the same as the knowledge of the names, so it is imperative that the angels know that it is true in the help of those of those who are the same The science gets its honesty, and that requires that it be the same as the names of these names, advanced on that learning.The answer to the first: Why is it not permissible for it to be said by the creation of the science that is a place that put this name for this heavens for this heavens, other than the one who is not.And on this, it is not necessary that the adjective to be known as the harm is in the case of the one who is known to be known to the same, and we greeted us that he is the Almighty, so that he did not create this.(P-162) It is said: It is the Almighty created it in the face of the sane person, and the abstinence of worship in this place is followed, and from the second: why it is not permissible to say: By writing and otherwise, and on the third: There is no doubt that the will of God is up to the Almighty to put those provinces to those suffering as a precursor to the teaching, so that is enough to add to the knowledge of the His two will come if God Almighty wills, and God Almighty knows.
