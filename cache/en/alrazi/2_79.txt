The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: And among them are illiterate, they do not know the book except my aspirations, even if they do not think of a loyalty to those who write the book with their hands, then say this To buy it with a little thues to be a loyalty to them from what was written by their hands and a night to them, which is what they gain.He described them with stubbornness and removed the sake of their faith among their teams, for the first difference is the lost, stray team, and they are those who perceive the word, and the words of the word The second: the hypocrites, the third difference: those who argue with the hypocrites, and the loud teams: they are the ones who are removed in this verse and they are the public of the mother who are not the public.Knowing them with loyalty, no writings, and their methods of imitation and the acceptance of what is said to them, so God has shown that those who refrain from the acceptance of the faith are not.Rather, every section of them has another reason and whoever contemplates what God has mentioned in this verse from the explanation of the teams of Jews, and that is found in his eyes in the eyes of this mother.The truth is evaluated and seeks to add others who are in the middle of the one who is in the middle, and the one who is in general is an urgent imitation, and here are the questions: the question is: Some of them are the one who does not acknowledge a book or a messenger.Others said: Whoever does not improve the writing and readings, and this second is a fast because the verse is in the Jews and they are coupled with the book and the Messenger, and because it is upon him the prayer and peace, he said: We write and do not calculate.The second question: “Al -Amani” is a security collection and has a shared with one origin: one of them: what the human imagination is imagined, so it is appreciated in his soul and his heart, This is their saying: so that it is a promise, so let it not, and it is the saying of the Almighty: He promises them and wishes them and what the Satan promises them, except for the deception [Al -Nasi: 120] His saying: Except my aspirations, except for what they have from their aspirations in that God is up to them that does not take them with their sins, and that their prophetic fathers fail them Modernity.And the second: except for my aspirations, except for the different lies that he heard from their scholars, so they accepted it to the imitation.I wished him a mother, she made it.And the third of it: except for my aspirations, that is, what they read from his saying: I wish the book of God the first night.The owner of the scout said: The detence is from me, if it is estimated that the one who has been appreciated is appreciated in itself and it is permissible for what he belongs to, and that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Such, Abu Muslim said: He carried him On the wish of the heart, it is the same as the Almighty saying: And they said that the paradise will not enter except for those who were unaware or Christians of those whose aspirations [the cow: 111] And God Almighty said: He is not in your faithful, nor the faithful of the people of the book, whoever does a misfortune that is rewarded for it [Al-Nasiya: 123] and he said: These are their aspirations.Our worldly life will die, and what we have, but the forever, and what they have known as knowledge, if they are not thinking [Al -Jataya: 24] in the sense that they are appreciated and drained.And the many said: He carried it on the readers, as the Almighty said: If the Satan wished for his wish [Hajj: 52] and because his pregnancy is on the authority of the ritual Because if we carried it on that, he had a cling to him, then he said: They do not know the book except with the amount of what is recited to them, so they hear it, and it is not possible for them to be.They are able to reflect on and contemplate, and if they are carried out that the intended hadiths, lies, or thinking, estimation, and the hadith of the soul, the discretion in it is rare.The third question: His Excellency said: Except for the sake of the abuse, the naps said: ؎ I have come to the right of others with no He was read “except for me” by lowering.As for his saying, “If they do not think, then the investigator is what we said, because the secretariat, if I want to appreciate it and the thoughts of matters that are not true for it, then it is for you Frame.And it is a saying that he says: The hadith of the soul is not otherwise, so it is not necessary, and if the repetition is required, and if we carry it on the recitation of them, they will be good, so it is, as if he said: They know the book, except that they are recited to them, and they hear it, otherwise that it is mentioned to them, as it is wanted, and they will be wonder The verse is: one of them: that the knowledge is a plural, not a warning, so those who do not know and think.And the second: the prolongation of imitation is divorced, and it is a problem because the conversion is in the horror.And the third: that the misleading, even if it is defamatory, is the misguided by the misleading of the misleading, as well as defaming because it is the Almighty to defame them, even if they were in this row.And the one that is the one: that the confessing of thinking about the principles of religion is not permissible, and God knows.As for the saying of the Exalted: a loyalty, they said: The state is a word that is said by every deception, and Ibn Abbas said: It is the illuminated torment.And on the authority of Sufyan Al -Thawri: It is the path of the people of Hell, and on the authority of the Messenger of God ﷺ: The judge said: “Wali” includes the end of the return and the supplies.As for the saying of the Almighty: They write the book with their hands in his mouth and Jahan: The first: The man may say that I wrote if he commands that with that, then the benefit of his saying: The face.The second: It is sure, and this position is what is good in which the affirmation is as you say to those who deny the knowledge of what he wrote: Oh, this is written by you.As for his words, the Almighty: Then they say this from God, so what is meant is that whoever writes this writer and supports this gain in the end of the ritual, because they are lost and they are lost I was drawn to them with their sons, so their sin is greater than the sin other than them, because the one who knows that the lie is other than what is harmful The lies are the misguidance, and the love of the world and the inherent in their crime and the guarantee of them is that it paved the way in the misguidance, remaining on the face of the forefront, so that it is the same.If it was said: He is the highest of them, two things: one of them: the book of the book, and the other: its attribution to God is the Almighty on the path of the lie, so this is the goodness of the book, or on the authority of the book Book to God or to them together?We said: There is no doubt that the writings of falsehoods to intend to deliver from the ancients and lies to God, as well, as well, and the collection between them is a great deny.As for his words, the Almighty: to buy it a little thues to him, then he alerts him to two things: the first: that he alerts him to the end of their misery, because the mind is not.In the last for the sake of the reward (P-129) in the world, how can he be able to satisfy the great punishment in the last for the sake of the boundary in the world.The second: It indicates that they did not do that, but rather, they did a request for the tendency and the prestige, and this indicates that taking money on falsehood, and if it is for me, then it is for me.Those who were giving him money were love and satisfaction, and with that, he had alerted to the prohibition of his prohibition.As for his words, the Exalted: Woe to them, what was written by their hands.The remembrance of the money was restored in the gain, and if it was not considered his remembrance, it was permissible to say: their entire group requires the great return without every one of them, so he is removed from it The suspicion, and they differed in the words of the Almighty: What they gain, are they what they were taking on this writer and prohibition, so that it is only, or the meant.And the closest in the system of speech is that it is returned to the masculine of the money taken on this face, even if the closest is where the general is that it includes all, but the one is the one They restrict their earnings with this restriction, and the bid is not good for it because the gain is in it in it And the forbidden, so it is imperative that it be supplied, and the first thing that restricts it is what its remembrance was presented.The judge said: The verse indicated that their writers were not created for God Almighty, because if it was a creation for God, the Almighty would have added it to him, the Almighty: A fact because it is up to them, if he created it in them, then he gave the servant to be acquired, except that the act of the verb to the Creator is stronger than his affiliation to the inbath, so it was the same More from its attribution to the servant, so they had to be fulfilled by praise for their saying in it: it is from God and when it was not like that, it is not so that it is so Created to God Almighty.The answer is that the preacher assigned to it from the creation of God is the Almighty with the reminders, it is also that it is like that, and God knows.
