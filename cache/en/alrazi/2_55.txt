The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And when you said, O M and We will not believe for you until we see God as a wicker, then the thunderbolt took you and you look at you, then you will be from you.Thank you, know that this is the sixth year, his two signs: one of them: as if he is up to the Almighty, he said: Remember my grace when you said, “I will not be happy.So the thunderbolt took you and then greeted you to repent of you, and you will be overwhelmed by punishment and win the reward.And the second: that there is a warning for those who were in the time of our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ about the action of what is worthy of what is due to him to do what he did with those.And the third of it: they liken them in their widespread the miracles of the Prophet ﷺ with their predecessors in the wig On the authority of the Prophet, but it does not appear from the Prophet ﷺ like it, because it was his knowledge that if he appeared, they would be unjust, and if they were unjust, they would not be punished.And the one who has been: in it a question of the prophet ﷺ from what was received from them and was proven to his heart on patience, as he was patient with the determination of the messengers.Fifth: It has a semi -suspicion of those who say: The prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ if it was true that the people would have believed in the belief in it, the people of the book, because they did not know it Show that their ancestors with their views of those bright verses on the prophecy of peace be upon him, peace be upon him.They are violated by Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and if they found in their books the news about his prophets.And its sixth: When Muhammad told him, peace and blessings be upon him, this story is with him that he was my illiteracy, and he did not occupy the learning of the deceased.The second research: for those who are interpreters in this existence, say: The first saying: that this existence was after that, God, the servant of the servant, said: Bin Ishaq: When Moses returned, peace be upon him, from the phase to his people, he saw what they were on the servants of the hurry and said to his brother and the Samaritan what he said.He burned the hurry and threw it in the sea, seven seventy people from their choice, and when they went out to the phase, they said to Moses: Save your Lord until he hears us.Peace, and God answered him to him, and when he came from the mountains, a mourner of the dignity was signed, and the mountains were cheated on all of it.And they were, and Moses, peace be upon him, when his Lord spoke to him and he fell on his forehead, a bright light that is not able to seek one of the children of Adam, the view of it, and he heard the words He says to him, do and do not do, so when the words were revealed, Moses Al -Ghamam, in which he entered, said, and the people said after That: We will not believe for you until we see God as a wicker, so the thunderbolt took them and died all, and Moses raised his hands to the sky, praying and saying: Oh, whoever says: Seventh man to be my martyrs with the acceptance of their repentance, so I return to them and not with me one of them, so what they say is in me, so he did not.Until God returned to them their souls and demanded the kindness of the children of Israel from the worship of the hurry, and he said: No, they only kill themselves.After the killing, Al -Saddy said: When the children of Israel repented from the servants of the hurry, that they killed themselves, God Almighty will come to them in the people of the people of the sons The servants of the hurry, so Moses was seen seventy men, and when they came to the phase, they said: We will not believe for you until we see God as a phenomenon, so they took them and took them.He cries and says: O Lord, what do I say to my children, I have commanded them to kill and then I chose from their rest.To them?So God revealed to Moses that these seventy of those who took the hurry to God, and Moses said: If it is only your death [Al -Arif: 155] to the saying of it: The exalted, they revived them, and they looked and looked at each other to the other.And God answered his call.And know that it is not in the verse that indicates the hypothesis of one of the words on the other However.As for his words, the Exalted: We will not believe for you, so we are not true, and we do not believe you, and we do not recognize your prophecy until we see God as a vast [that is].The owner of the scouts said: It is a source of your saying: I fled with the rule and the supplication, as if the one who sees the eyes is ready with vision and who sees the heart of the heart and the heart of it, and the heart of it is afraid of it.Because it is a type of vision, so it was established by its verb, as the penalty is set by the verb of the gels or the case in the sense of the wickedness A source is like a prevailing, or a gathering is ready, and the locks are the origin of the wickedness of the appearance.Until his waters appeared, and a voice of a vast and a man is said, if his voice is high, and it is said: A vicious face if it is the appearance of light, but they said: they said: It is delusional that it is intended to see the knowledge or the imagination of [the gravity] of what the sleeping sees.As for the saying of the Exalted: I took you to the thunder On that the vision of God is a blessed, the judge, Abd al -Jabar, said: It was if it was evident, they would have become a permissible matter, so it is obligatory to do so, it is not necessary for them to be.The Akbah is descended from them, when they are touched from the power to power and food to food in the saying of the Almighty: We will not be patient with one food, so let us be blessed with us The earth [Al -Qarra: 61], and Abu al -Husayn said in the book of descriptions: God is the highest that mentioned the question of the vision, unless it is exaggerated, and that is in the verses of (one of them), this is the one who is the one who is the one who is) It was a viable for their saying: We will not believe for you until we see God as a vast as saying the nations because of their prophet Take the thunderbolt.And the second: His Excellency said: The people of the book ask you to download a book from the sky, so they asked Moses more than that, so they said: With their injustice [Al -Nasa: 153], then he called this injustice and punished them immediately, and if the vision was brought to them, their question has been made for it to the one who asks for a miracle.If you said, is it that it is their pursuit and the transgression of the book from the heaven, the course of the vision in the unity So the question of the vision.I said: Al -Zahir requires the fact that each one of them is forbidden that he left to work with it in removing the book, so it remains a work with it in vision.And the third of it: His Exalted said: And he said who do not hope for our meeting, if not for us, the angels, or we see (P-80), our Lord, will be arrogant to us.Long [Al -Faraqan: 21] The vision, even if it was evident and it is for its permissible one of the largest benefits, was not a struggle that it is a matter It was not worthy and that is done by the course of what is said, we will not believe for you until God revives your prayers.And he knew that this face is shared in one letter, which is that the vision if it was evident, it would not have been a question and denounced, and that is a variety.[And] his saying: If the man of the benefits are asked to move from food to food, when it was possible, he was not aware of it, as well as the saying in the request of the path of miracles.We said: And why did you say that when he was the one who was able to do so, it is not a pleasure, so that the student of every possible one is unable to do so, and the accommodation is in the same way.With the people of knowledge and how, and that God is the highest that mentioned the vision except and mentioned with it something that is able to judge our parallel with the agreement, and it is either the descent of the book.The adversity of the Ato was proven to the entirety of the two things, and that is like the curtain of the powerful in the fact that the adveris of the Ato was not obtained for the sake of the one who is overlooked.As for saying Abi Al -Hassan: Al -Zahir requires the fact that everyone is forbidden, and you can do the work with it in some, and it will be done in the rest.We said: You have not established an indication that the arrogance is not achieved unless the one who is required is obedient, but rather you have been reluctant to in it on the ritual of the proverb, and the example is not in this door, and the example is not.Your saying: The phenomenon requires the universe of everyone.He showed what we said, the words of the disgraced.If he said: What is the reason for the severity of the question?.The answer is in that, it is enticed by its faces: one of them: that the vision of God is the Almighty, only to be obtained in the hereafter, so its request in the world was denounced.And the second: that the ruling of God is the Almighty to remove the depression of the servant if God sees, so the request of vision was to remove the cost, and this is on the saying of the one who is the one; Because the vision includes the fierce science and the fierce science that contradicts the cost.And the third of it: that when the evidence was dumped on the rhetoric of the claimant, the request of the extensive indicators was cursed and the profession is the reflection.And it is up to it: It is not possible that God knows that he is in preventing the creation from his vision of his pursuit in the world in order to strike from the interesting reconciliation, so let him go to the The world, as he knew that in the removal of the book from the sky and the removal of the angels from the sky, a great spinning, so this is the most aspiration of the request of that, and God knows best.The second research: for those who are interpreters in the thunderbolt: The first: that it is the death and it is the saying of good and the murderedness, and they needed it with the saying of the one who said: Whoever wants God [Al -Zamar: 68], and this is weak for his faces: one of them: His Exalted: So the thunderbolt took you and you look at you Look at the thunderbolt.And the second: that he said in the right of Moses: Moses was shocked [Al -Araf: 143] On the authority of the death, but rather from the cheating.And the third: that the thunderbolt is the one that shakes and that is a sign of the death.And its elevation: that its roses while they are seen in the chapter of the Aqsoubah from it if it is returned as a lunch while they do not know.Therefore, he said: You are looking at the greatness of the drug.The second saying: It is the saying of the investigators that the thunderbolt is the reason for the death, and for that he said in Surah Al -Arif: So when the man took them [Al -Araf: 155] Something was on three directions: one of them: it is a fire that was fell from the sky, and it was burned.And the second: a shout that came from the sky.And the third of it: God sent the Heaven to hear with their sense, and they were shocked by two dead one day and night.(P-81) As for his words, the Almighty: Then we sent you after your death because the mission has been [ No] only after the death, as the Almighty saying: We were struck by their ears in the cave, a year, and then we sent them to know which of the parties of the two parties:.If you say: Do you enter Moses, peace be upon him in this words?I said: No, to Jahin: The first: It is a discourse that is a disclosure, so it is not obligatory for Moses, peace be upon him.The second: that if Moses would not be dedicated to him, he would be specialized in his words, the highest in the right of Moses: when he woke up [Al -Arif: 143] with the memorization of the horizon, it is not used in the death.Qatibah: Moses, peace be upon him, has died while he was a mistake for what he has shown.As for his words, the Almighty is: Perhaps you will thank you, so what is meant is that it is up to them, but he sent them after the death in the home of the world to cost them and to be able to do so from the faith, and from the faith of the faith, and from the faith of what is from the faith, and from the faith of the He wrapped them, so he said to him: Maybe you thank you, and to the pronouncement of the thank you, all obedience to the saying of the Almighty: How can he cost them and have died, and if it is permissible, then it is not permissible to cost the people of the last if he sent them after death?We said: He who is forbidden from their costs in the hereafter is not the death and then the life, but rather it is forbidden from that that he has been forced to do the day of resurrection to the knowledge of the day The pleasures and what is in the fire from the pain and after the fierce knowledge, do not be amended, then if the objection is this, this is not a reason for those who have died, and God has not been blessed, and there is no one who has been.Likewise, it is true that they will be charged after and be their deaths, then the neighborhood is in the home of the sleep or the dignity of the dignity.And it was quoted from Al -Hasan Al -Basri that he was the height of their deadlines with this death and then he returned them as he revived the one who died when he passed through a village and she was hidden from the time They came out of their paths and they are woven who warned the death, and this is weak because it is the highest of what he died in the thunder The other time is for their life.As for the cursing of the dismissed by the Almighty saying: Perhaps you will thank you for the highness that wants faith from all, for our answers to it, so that it is not necessary.
