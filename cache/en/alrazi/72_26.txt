The Quranic researcher said, "The scholar of the unseen, so no one will appear on his absence, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger of memorization" from his saying: from a messenger who is not satisfied On the absence, except the one who is a messenger, who is a messenger, the owner of the “scout” said: In this heroes of the dignity; Because those who are added to them, and if they are the guardians of those who are, they are not messengers, and God has specialized the messengers from among those who are involved in the absence, and the absence of the absence, Magician and astrology; Because her companions are something of the eruption and put it in the widow, the one said: And in this indication that whoever claims that the stars indicate that it is from what is from the life of the He disbelieved in the Qur’an.He knows that the one is permissible for the knees, and that God will inspire his guardians and fall into some of the exclusives in the future.And the attribution of the verse to the two pictures is one, so if it makes the verse indicating the prohibition of the rulings of the stars, then it is not possible to make it indicative of the prevention of what the dignity of what he said.He claimed that it does not indicate the prevention of the inspirations that occur to the guardians, so we will not make it indicative of the prohibition from the evidence of the stars, so the ritual is the authority of the ritual.Among the rulings of the rulings and the number of its consequences for the inspirations that occur to the guardians, and the jurisprudence is repeated, and when the verse is not a sign of it, it is what they said, His saying: On his absence, there is no form of a general in it, so it is sufficient to work in its requirement that the exalted be not appeared to be created on one of the absences of his absence, and he is a good man.The resurrection is, so it is what is meant by the verse that it is not the same as this absence for anyone, so there is no significance in the verse that it does not appear anything from the absence, and this is not Tawlin that he is exalted, but he mentioned this verse as the one who said his saying: If I know, I will come to what you are promised, or will he make my Lord a long time, I mean, I will not know the time of the time.The scholar of the unseen, so it does not appear on his absence, that is, the time of the resurrection of the unseen that God does not appear to anyone, and in the sentence, the one who said: It is sufficient for him to do with him, his pregnancy is on one absence.A messenger with that this absence does not appear for anyone of his messengers?We said: Rather, it will show it with the proximity of the resurrection of the resurrection, and how is it not, and he said: And the day the sky is stolen with the dignity, and the angels are removed, and the angels are removed.(P-149) They know in that time the resurrection, and also it is necessary for this discretion that this is a disconnected So he does not appear on his special absence, which is the resurrection of the resurrection, and then he said after him: But whoever is satisfied with a messenger, then he asks you from his hands They keep it from the evil of the murder of humanity and heaven; Because he is the Almighty, but he mentioned these words as answer to the question of those who asked him about the time of the resurrection on the way of the jewelry of it, and the entirety of his religion.And know that it is necessary to cut that it is not the intention of God from this verse that no one will be informed of anything from the absences except the messenge With the closeness of the frequency that a slit and a flattering were two priests who told the appearance of our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ before the time of his appearance, and they were in the Arabs, and they were in the Arab Knowledge, until he returned to them as a break in the knowledge of the news of our messenger Muhammad ﷺ, and it was proven that God Almighty might be informed of the messengers of the messenger.And the second: that all the boredom and the religions are applied to the health of the knowledge, and that the crossing may tell about the struggles of the coming from the coming of the coming in the way In it.And the third of it: that the priest of Baghdad, which was transmitted by the Sanjar Bin Malik Shah from Baghdad to Kharasan, and asked her about the coming conditions in the righteous, so that he is the one who is coming.She fell on her words.(He said the book of the book) God has seen him with goodness: I have seen people who are achieved in the sciences of words and wisdom, they told them that they were informed of the absence Displacement, and those creatures came on the authority of their news, and the Abu Al -Barakat was in the book of the one who is considered in the explanation of its condition, and he said: I have been examined by the same time I was taught that she was telling about the absences of good news.And the sequence of it: We are witnessing [that] in the companions of the sincere inspirations, and this is not concluded with the priority, but it may be found in the magician, too, whoever is like that The arrow of the unseen on the path of its luxury is like that in many of its news, even if it may lie in the most in the most news of that news, and we see the rulings of the stars.And agreeing to the matters, and if they may lie in many of them, and if that is a perceived viewer, then the saying is that the Qur’an indicates that it is different from what the Qur’an is from what is left to the Qur’an, And that is false, so we did not know that the correct interpretation is what we mentioned, and God knows.
