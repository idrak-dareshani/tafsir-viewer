The ninety -ninth questioner: Al -Qadi said: This definition is invalidated by algebra from his face It is denying that the servant is effective, and it could not be proven in the first place, and in this heroes of the miracle.And secondly: that it is excused for their saying that it is lost in the estimated ability and is equal in that that is miraculous and what is not, so it is not valid for the meaning Their saying.Other than a doubt, it is obligatory to prove this miracle on this saying.And its elevation: that the miracle is indicated by the contradiction of the habit, if their saying: The usual is also a verb, and this is not proven, then this is not the case.In the miracle.Fifth: that the Messenger ﷺ invokes that he is the highest of that, in this way of believing that he claimed it, and if it was not that of him, he did not.And on their saying with algebra, this difference is not valid; Because the accustomed and the usual is only from it.The answer is that the one who is required to be determined is either that the characteristic comes with the one who is intended by a intention or that this is an agreement from it, and the second is invalid; Because the agreements are not in its capacity, then you have proven the first, and if it was, it is proven that it is a challenge to the limit that it is based The intention, if it is from it, is obligatory to be sneezing, and it is referred, and if it is from God, the exalted, then it will come back and the algebra will return to it, and it is necessary for all that he wants to all of what he said.As for the saying of the Exalted: If you do not do and you will not do, then know that this verse is indicative of the miracle of the faces of four: Entity of hostility to the Messenger of God ﷺ and in the end of the urbanization of his command; Because the separation of the elderly and the tribes and the vigilance of the soul and the irritation is one of the strongest what is indicated by that, then if it is added to it like this is the one who says: Do not, and if they were in their capacity, and they were the same as the Qur’an, or with the same as a wall of it, they would not have it, so that it is not possible.And the second: It is that - peace be upon him - and if he was accused of them, while he is connected to the prophecy, then he was known to the situation in the mind of the mind, the grace, the virtue, and the knowledge The accusation was shed to the prophecy that he claimed from the prophecy, as it was the one that he was united and informed in the determination to its end, but it would be a disgraceful and disgrace from what he did not.He returns and has all his affairs, and he will be from that ﷺ, and if it had not known it, it is not necessary It is for him to carry them on the opposite of the methods of the methods.And the third of it: that he - peace be upon him - if he was not a residence with the health of his prophethood, when he cut off in the news that they did not come to the same; Because if he was not a residence, his prophecy was permissible, and his disagreement is permissible, and with the appreciation of the fall of his succession, he appears to appear, so the abuse is not overwhelmed.Speech and does not defeat him, so when he was rewarded, he - upon him - peace and blessings be upon him - was a heir in his command.And the one that is: that the news of this news was found on that direction; Because from his days - peace and blessings be upon him - to our time, this is not a time from those who are given from those who are hostile to religion and Islam and its districts are accustomed to in the sake of it.Then with this severe urgency, the opposition was not found.This is the four faces in the significance of the miracle of what this verse is covered, and that is indicated by the corruption of the saying of the ignorant who is the one who says: It includes the argument and the recipient.We are asking: the first question: their adherence to the wall is obligatory, so it is not possible with the one who has the obligatory one without the doubt?Answer: It is in it and they are: On their shouts and stated them on the words.The second: to be abused by them, as he says the Sufis with the powerful power of himself by prevailing over those who take it: if I prevail, and he knows that he knows that he knows that Inside him.The second question: Why did he say: If you did not do and did not say: If you did not come to him?The answer: Because this is more insignificant than it is said: if you do not come with a wall of it, and you will not come with a wall of the like.The third question: and you will not do what its place?The answer is not a place because it is a symptomatic sentence.The Following question: What is the right (not) in the chapter of negation?The answer: I do not, and I will not be two sisters in the negation of the future, except that in “you will not be sure and tightened, you say to your friend: I do not stay tomorrow with you, for you are, for you are.Then it contains three sayings: one of them: its origin is not, and it is the saying of the cell.And the second: No, a thousand were shown, and it is the saying of the freedom.And the third of it: the letter of a stabilization to confirm the exile of the future, which is the saying of Sibuyeh, and one of the two narrators about the successor.The fifth question: What is the meaning of its integrity in the abuse of the fire, the abandonment of their two chances of its likeness?Answer: If they appear on the opposition, it is true that the Messenger of God is true.The stubbornness, so the influencer was established in the place of the effect, and his saying was made: Fear the fire, saying the position of his saying: So leave the stubbornness, and this is the brief that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Tawil for the stubbornness; To give up the fire of the fire, it is followed by the threshold of the thief of the fire.The sixth question: What is the fuel?The answer: It is what the fire is led by, and the source is angry and the conquest came in it.More, and Al -Windh: Hattab, and Issa Bin Umar read with the guarantee, named after the source, as it is said: So and so, the people of his people and his country are proud.The seven question: the link “which” must be a case with knowledge, so how can you know that the fire of the hereafter is led by people and staging?Answer: It is not forbidden for them to be presented with that hearing from the people of the book, or they heard it from the Messenger of God ﷺ or they heard before this verse in which he said: People and stroke.The eighth question: Why did the fire described in this sentence came in the way of the prohibition, and we are defined?Answer: That verse was descended with the king, and they knew from it a fire that was drowned with this row, then this came down with the city of the city.The ninth question: What is the meaning of its saying: the fuel of the people and the spare of the answer: It is a fire that is distinguished from the fire that it is not possible except for people and the stagnation, and this is the same The first: that if the fire is the fire, if the people are burned with it, or the warmth of the carpentry, it was first led by the boss, then it was presented in it what it is intended to burn or its grace, and that With his wide mercy - it leads with the same burning.The second: It is because of the excess of its freedom, it is imitated in the stone.The tenth question: Why did the people of the carg about and the carpenter was made with them and fuel?Answer: Because they were coupled with themselves in the world, where they took it as idols and made them for God and worship them without it.98] And this verse is an innocent for it, so it is said: You and what you worship from God [Al-Anbiya: 98], (p-113) in the sense of people and staging, and the stones The infidels in their slaves are lost without God, that they are the luxury and the magnanimity who are interrogated by them and they will pay the harms from them God made her torture, and he combined them with a hell in the fire of hell in informing and westernization in their fraud, and the like is what he does with the disbelievers who made them, and those who make them.And as an ammunition, they shouted with it and prevented it from the rights, where it is surrounded by it in the fire of hell, and it is obligatory with their foreheads, their south, and their appearance.It was said: It is the stagger of the Grands, and it is specialized with a sign of an indication, but in which it indicates its corruption, and that is because the presentation is that we glorify the righteousness of this The oldest is a matter often The fire, but if we carried it on the path of the carpentry, this is a sign of the greatness She is attached to the first thing that is a warranty for the world.As for his saying: It is prepared for the disbelievers, it is indicated that this is the supporting fire is prepared for the disbelievers, and there is nothing in it that it indicates that there is a sign of that Supplies with these attributes prepared for the bride of the people of prayer.
