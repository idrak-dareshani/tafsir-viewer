The Quranic researcher is the following: His exalted say: We have touched the sky, so we found it filled with a strict guardian and the touches of touch, so it was rented to the one; Because the diamond is a definition is a definition that is said: to touch and touch it, and the same body is said: they are their eyes with their eyes, and it is an impurity, and the meaning is asking for the sake of the heavens, And the proceeds are a common name in the sense of guards, such as servants in the sense of servants; Therefore, it was described as hard, and if he went to its meaning, he would have said.The eighth type: His exalted say: We were soaked from it a bounty of hearing, so whoever listens now to finds a wardrobe, that is, we will not be listened We threw with the lust, and in his saying: a meteor of monotheism and faces: one of them: a fighter said: It means throwing from the martyrs and the monotheism of the angels, and on this, it is necessary for me to be a meteor.And monitoring; Because the monitoring is not a meteor, and it is a gathering.And the second: Al -Farah said: That is, a meteor, I have been intended for it to be imposed on it, and on this monitor, it is called for the meteors, and it is a verb in the sense of an act.And the third of it: it is permissible to be a monotheism, that is, a heading, and that is because the meteor is what was prepared for him, as if the meteor is a steadfastness for him and he was intended for him, and I know that I am in his mind.The question is in the interpretation of his Almighty saying: We have decorated the worldly sky with a wretchedness and made it as a stir Mawjouda before the sabid, and it is indicated by things: one of them: that all the ravaged ones are speaking in the causes It was up to the mission.And the second: His Exalted: The Heaven has decorated the worldly sky with a wilderness, and we made it as a stomach for those who were mentioned in the creation of the makers, the two of the two.And the third of it: that this ritual arrival came in the poetry of the people of the ignorance, Os bin Harjah said: Bin Al -Kharn: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ or the one who is the one who follows the blood followed by the blood followed by the blood.“The Messenger of God ﷺ is sitting in a blow from the supporters, when he was thrown with a chain of transmission, so he said: What you were saying in the same way is in the ignorance?They said: We were saying: A great or a great person dies.So that this shelter was proven, that this martyr was in existence before the mission, so what is the meaning of its specialization with Muhammad, peace and blessings of God?And (the answer): a building on two places: the first place: that this martyr was not in the way before the sabad As a heel, it was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: “Gin was ascending to the sky, and they listened to the revelation, so if they heard (P-140) the word, they increased in it nine, but the word is that it is true In vain, when the Prophet was sent ﷺ, they were forbidden, and the stars were not seen before that, so he said to them: What is this only for the matter So they found the Messenger of God ﷺ as a person who prayed.Quraysh saw something that they saw before that, and they made them repent to them and fear their neck, they think that it is the death, so he informed that of you, so he said: Do you do what I see?They said: Throwing with the stars, and we were hardened from the sky, so he said: Be patient, then you will be known, then the time of the people, and if it is a time They spoke and looked, so if it is not known, then tell him and said: In the matter, it is deadly, and this is when a prophet appears, so they did not turn away until they are not even the way And those of those who are told that he was the appearance of Muhammad ibn Abdullah, and he claims that he is a messenger Prophet The late people, this question is this; They stabbed them in this miracle, as well as the poems that are forgotten to the ignorant people of the ignorant, perhaps they are separated and imposed.The second place: It is the closest to the right thing that this martyr was a supply before the sabu The Quran has not been preserved; Because he said: So we found it full and this is indicated that the juvenile is the fullness and the many, and so he said: The ritual and the lust and the fullness of all of them, on this who carried the jinn on the beating in the country and demanded the cause, but it is the greatness of the dawn and the prevention of the ritual.
