The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: He came to us Moses Al -Kabir and stopped us after him with the messengers, and Jesa, the son of Mary, came to us with the sons of the souls, and he will be in the spirit You have been arrogant, and you have lied to you, and you kill you.Al -Qabah, and that is because it is exalted when he described the state of Jews before that they violate the command of God Almighty to kill themselves The industrialization bought the worldly worldly, increased their crying in what he mentioned in this verse.As for the book, it is the one who is the one who was a single sentence, narrated from Ibn Abbas that the Tawaranah when it came down, the command of God, Moses, with its lamb, so it was not for you, so it is not for you, so it is not.A letter from it as a king, and they did not restrict its pregnancy, and God has reduced it to Moses, so he carried it.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: We are after him after the messengers, so he has two questions: the first question: We are standing, follow us by the one who comes from the thing, After the sins of his sin, and his counterpart, his saying: Then we sent our messengers to see [the believers: 44].The second question: It was narrated that after Moses, peace be upon him, until the days of Jesus, peace be upon him, the messengers were frequent, and some of them appear in the effect Peace be upon him, for he is the prayers of God, upon him, he came with a new project, and they inferred the health of that with the saying of His Excellency: and he will be upon him.One of them in the project follows some of them in it.Ziada and no shortening, with the fact that this project is a futmouter, which can be known for the frequency of the first, because the Messenger, if this is his condition, is not that he is not.He has learned before or can be known before, so it is not permissible for God to send a messenger, not a law with him, in the first place, and the mind is clear The saying in our question: I have proven that it is necessary in the messengers who came after the peace of peace be upon him, that they have come to me by law (p-161) Funning or alive for some of the first project.The answer is: Why is it not permissible for the intended to be the mission of these messengers, the exile of that project that is successful on the nation or another type of one who knows it?And in the sentence, the judge is what came in this significance, except by returning the claim, and he said: It is not permissible to send these messengers except for a new project or for the urbanism Did you get the conflict, except in this?The third question: these messengers are: Shi’ah, Shamil, Shamoun, Dawad, Silman and Population, Armiya, Azir, Hazakil, Al -Iliaz, It lives, and others.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: I am Jesus, the son of Maryam, the sons, so he has anxes: the first question: the reason for God is the highest of the remembrance of the Messenger, then the remembrance Before the messenger, they came with a Moses ’project, so they were followed by him, and not Jesus, because his journey was copied the most of Moses, peace be upon him.The second question: Jesus was said by the Surdish, and Maryam in the sense of the servant, and it was said: Maryam in the crossing is from the women as a man of the men, and the men of the men, Rashah: I said to a minor, and the third question was reached by the third question: in the sons, it is a face: one of them: the miracles of the life of the dead and the same.And the second: it is the evangelist.And the third of it: It is the strongest that everyone enters it, because the miracle shows the health of its prophecy, as the Gospel shows the entity of its project, so it is not for the sake meaning.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: He supported him in the spirit of Jerusalem.They are two linguistics, such as nasty and terrifying.The second question: they disagreed in the spirit on its faces: one of them: that it is Gabriel, peace be upon him, but it was called for this way: the first: that the one who wants the soul of the soul of the soul of the soul of the soul As it is said: the generosity of the generosity and a man of truthfulness, and he described Jabriel with that, in order to share it with him and a pyramid for perhaps that you will be blessed with God Almighty.The second: Gabriel, peace be upon him, was named after that, because the religion lives with it as the body lives in the spirit, for it is the one who is in the way of removing the revelation to the angel, They live in their religion.The third: that the majority of the spirituality, as well as the paths of the angels, are unless his spirituality is full and complete.The lord: Jabriel was called upon peace be upon him as a soul, because it was not destroyed by the wetness of al -Fawal and the mercy of the mothers.And the second: What is meant by the spirit of the Glorious Jerusalem, as he said in the Qur’an: a spirit of our command [Al -Shura: 52] and he was called by it because the religion revives it and the validity of the world.And the third: It is the name that he was greeted by peace be upon him, on the authority of Ibn Abbas and Saeed bin Jabir.And its elevation: It is the spirit in which it was blown in it and the Jerusalem is God Almighty, so the spirit of Jesus, peace be upon him, is attributed to himself (P-162), in order God, on the authority of the Lord, and on this, what is meant by the spirit that the human lives.He knew that release the name of the soul on Gabriel and on the Gospel and at the Great Name is a metaphor because the spirit is the wind The one who is frequent in the human being and its influences, and knowing that these three were not, as well The soul, as it is the reason for the life of the man, as well as Gabriel, peace be upon him, is the reason for the life of the hearts with the sciences, and the Gospel is the reason for the prestige of the evil and the sacrifice Because it is descended from it to obtain the purposes, but the likeness is between the name of the spirit and between Jabril, I have fulfilled his faces: one of them: because Jabril is upon him, peace be upon him Nurani is a gentle, so the similar was complete, and the name of the soul was divided into Gabriel.And the second: that this name is in it, as it appears as it is.And the third of it: that his saying is up to the Almighty: He supported him in the spirit of sanctification, meaning its strength, and what is meant by this piety is the relief and the support of the promise to Jabril, the peace of the peace The Great and the Great Name is metaphor, so that was the first.And the one who has been: It is that Jesus was chosen by Jabril, peace be upon them, from the custodians of the deceased, where no one of the prophets has to be upon them.Maryam with her birth, but Jesus, peace be upon him, was born from the blow of Gabriel, peace be upon him, who is his Lord in all the conditions and he was walking with him and he was with him.As for his words, the Almighty: Will a messenger come to you with what you do not like himself They lied to him, and if they were killed, they would kill him.Rather, they were also for their intending to raise in this world and their demand for its sake and the chairing of their general and take their money without the truth That is to lie to them for the sake of that, and they are deluded, as they are false, and they need to be burning and the misfortune of the Destroy in Adam.As for the saying of the Exalted: a jumpsuit, you lied and a companion killing, so he said to say: Is it said and a partner you killed?His answer is from two sides: one of them: that the last situation is intended because the matter is sober, so I want to be brought up in the spontaneity and its confusion in the hearts.The second: to want a group to kill them after that you have tried to kill Muhammad ﷺ if I had not been disobeyed from you, and that you would have made it free and heated for him.And peace be upon him at his death: “The dignity of a good thing is still to help me.This is the time for the obedience of my father.“God knows.
