The researcher is the Almighty: they are old to believe in you and a group of them would hear the words of God, then they will warn him of what they did not know, and they know that they know that they know The dome of the ancestors of the ancestors mentioned to us, and he explained from here the openings of the actions of the Jews who were in the time of Muhammad ﷺ, the lock of the mercy of God said: This surah is one of the farms of the sons of Esratil and its faces from the intention: one of them: the indication of it on the validity of the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ; Because he is informed of it, without learning, and that can only be with a living.And he shared with the benefit of this significance, the people of the book and the Arabs.Know that there is no referral that he took it only from the one.As for the Arabs, when they are witnessing that the people of the book are charity, praise in these news.And the second: the restriction of blessings on the children of Israel and what (P-122) from God Almighty on their predecessors of the types of dignity and grace, as the success of the Farqin family, was not the same.He is worshiped, and his support for them and make them a prophet and a mockery, and they can be tied to them in the land and separated it with the sea and its enemy, their enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy of the light, The sacrifice and the forgiveness of the sins that they committed from the worship of the hurry and the convergence of the events and the question of the view of God as a wicker, then what he brought out to the water from the water from the water from the water from the water And its removal of the sun and the peace of the sun, and their resurrection is from the sun in the shadow of the clouds, so God reminded them of this blessing and the conversation.And the third of it: the news of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to inform their disbelief, their confession, their division, and their cursing with the prophets, and their stubbornness, and for them, and they are in their mind It is informed by one of the nations before them, and that is because after the scenes of the brilliant verses, they worshiped the calf after the separation of the peace of the peace of the peace On their country, then when they went through the entry of the door in prostration and to say a cow and promise them to forgive their sins and increase in the reward of the good, and they will be more.Then they asked the foam and the connection to the instead of Mina and al -Salawi, then they refrained from the acceptance of the teeth after their faith in Moses and their guarantee for him to do so that they will not be in.Until the mountains were raised, then they fell asleep in the Sabbath and used to, then when they were commanded to sacrifice the cow, they saw it, Moses, peace be upon him.He was shaken, then when they witnessed the neighborhoods of the dead, they were more cruel, as if God Almighty says: If this is their actions in between them and their transgressions with the same With it and save them from tenderness And the mouth is in its causes, so it is not a bodies in which they are treated by their custody, praise be to him, peace be upon you, for you, O Prophet and the believers, what you see from their people.And the one who seen it: warning the people of the book, which are in the time of the Prophet ﷺ from the descent of torment on them, as they descended with their predecessors in those bodies.Fifth: warning the Arabs of the Arabs that the torment will be revealed to them as it is on the first of those to Jews.And its sixth: that it is involved in the partners of the Arabs who are denounced to return with their acknowledgment of the appetite, and it is what is meant by his saying: “So, then he will live So we say: He was peace be upon him, who was pushed into the supplication to the truth and their acceptance of faith from it, and his chest was narrowed by their stubbornness, and their stubbornness, The news of the children of the great stubbornness with the view of the brilliant verses, as a rhetoric of his Messenger, while he appears from the people of the book in his time from the lack of acceptance, and he said: They are involved to believe in you, and here we are: the first question: in his words, the Almighty: they are involved to believe in you and the goodness: the one who is the one who is the one who said: The Prophet ﷺ is especially because he is the preacher and he is the intended of admiration and the memorizer, even if it is for the general, but we carried it on the privacy of this Qur’an, it is the one who is the Qur’an He entered the city and called for the Jews to the book of God and lied to Him, so God Almighty revealed this verse.The second: It is the saying of goodness that it is a discourse with the Messenger and the believers.The judge said: And this is the most promising of peace, because he is upon him, peace be upon him, and if the prayer is in the supplication, then he was in the companions who invite them to faith and show them the evidence, and the evidence for them, He says: They are involved to believe in you and want the Messenger and whoever this is from his companions, and if that is correct, then he does not leave the phenomenon.The second question: What is meant by its saying: to believe in you the Jews who were in the time of the Messenger, peace be upon him, because they are the ones who are good.And its dispute; Because the amplitude is valid in the future, not in the fall.They believed in Moses, peace be upon him, and he was the reason that God has saved them from humiliation and preferred them to all, and with the appearance of miracles that are overwhelmingly over his hands Repeated.The second: They are stalled to believe and show the belief and those who know the truth from them, and it is not recognized by that, but it is changed and replaced.The third: They are old to believe in you, these are the way of view and the recipient, how it was a group of their predecessors, they hear the words of the words God knows that he is a right and then they will support him.The following question: for a saying to say: The people are assigned to believe in God.What is the benefit in his saying: Do they believe that they believe in you?.The answer: It is a declaration of what they were called to him, and if the faith would be to God as he said: So he believed in him a Lot.It is intended to believe for your sake and for the sake of your tightening in their prayers to it, so this is the meaning of the addition.As for the saying of the Exalted: It was a group of them, so they have disagreed with that kinder They hear the words of God.And those who heard the words of God are the people of the meeqaat, and among them is those who said: Rather, what is meant by the parties who were in the time of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him A companion of them is a return to what you came to the ones who are the ones who have been exalted, with his saying: They are involved to believe in you and have been clear to us that those who are the one who commented They were in the time of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.If it was said: Those who heard the words of God are those who attended the meeqaat, we said: We do not surrender, but may be permissible in the one who hears the one who said: He is the one who said: For one of us, he heard the words of God if the Qur’an was read.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Then they deprive him of his questions: The first question: Al -Qafal said: The deprivation is the change and the disturbance, and the origin of the sacrifice is from the sacrifice And the prohibition on it, the Almighty said: Except is a burning for a fight or a biased to a category [Anfal: 16] and the prohibition is the hope of something from its right, it is said: a punctuation is a burning, if it is a p.Other than straight.The second question: The judge said: The prohibition is either to be in the memorial or in the meaning, and the burning is carried on the change of the memorizer.Because the words of God are exalted, if it remains on his side and changed his followers, but they are changed because of it, not because of the same words, if you are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same As it was narrated from Ibn Abbas that they have increased in it and shortened it, then it is first, and if it is not possible that it is necessary to carry the change of his interpretation, and if it is a matter It is forbidden for that if the words of God appear in a frequent appearance, such as the appearance of the Qur’an.It is seen in it, so if they change them for him, it will affect the argument of the argument with it, then it is necessary for God to prevent the exalted from him, and if it does not affect the right of it, then it is true.It is valid in the words that must be divided into what we mentioned.He has been correct on one side, and the Messenger is not known with persecution, for when he knows that, he prevented them from being forbidden for what he is offended by the knowledge That the first one is forbidden to prohibit the flesh of the pingle, the dead and the blood on others.Moses, peace be upon him.It was narrated that the people of the seventy seventy people heard the words of God when Moses spoke to the platter You can do these things, so do, and if you will do not do, then no bad, but if we say: those who are the ones who are the ones who were the one who were the one who were the one who were the one who was in the peace It is close to that what is meant is to deprive the matter of peace and blessings be upon him, and that is either that they perfected the Messenger and described it, or because they perfected the purity, as they were the ritual.The backs of the Qur’an does not indicate that anything they have perfected.The following question: For a saying that he says: How is it obligatory to take place for the burning of the people of the belief of the rest, because the stubbornness of the bit does not contradict?.Al -Qaflal answered him and said: It is possible for the meaning to be how they believe in these and they are taking their debt and learning it from the people of the people, so they are baptized.Rather, they teach them what they have permitted and changed it from its face and the imams, and they only accept that and do not fulfill the saying of the people of the truth, and it is like a saying to you.And I am not so!That is, you are taken from him, and you do not take it from others.The fifth question: They disagreed with his saying: They are involved, and they said, “God bless them with the faith of this division, and they are in a group.” Others said: He did not establish them from that except from the side of the reception for him from them with what they are from the prohibition, the trumpet and the stubbornness, they said: It is as we do not, and we do not.Our country.Then we do not cut off that they do not have to do so.And it is a saying that he said: His saying is up to the Almighty: they are involved to believe in you, as a matter On the authority of him that he does not believe in a forbidden, then the streamlined faces will come back to the news of what they have been presented.As for his words, the Exalted: From what they have said, what is meant is that they knew his health and the corruption of what they created, so they were stubborn, and they are upon you The words must be carried on the fact that they are the scholars from them and that they did that to be lost from the purposes on what God has shown, after the saying of God: Amr: 187] And he said: They know him as they know their children [the cow: 146] and it must be in their number a few, because the great gathering is not the same They believe that if we are distinguished by that, the right is not known from the invalid, even if the number is frequent.As for his words, they are: They know, so he said: His saying is up to the Almighty: His mind and they know that there is no more in it.Al -Qafil answered him from two faces: The first is: From what they have been reasonable, God wanted him, and they were the first to be interpreted as a corrupt one who knows that it is not the intention of God.The second: that they are reasonable, the intention of God Almighty, and they know that the corrupt state is causing them to be overwhelmed by the minor and the punishment of God Almighty, and when do you baptize from the sacrifice of what is from the knowledge of what is the knowledge of what is Their cruelty is more severe and their inventory, and when the intended of that was the Messenger of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and his patience with their stubbornness, so they were in their stubbornness.The questioning is stronger, and in the verse two questions: the first question: the judge said his saying is up to the Almighty: they are interrupted to believe in you for what you do not.They kissed them, because if he had the creation of God, they would not be in them, so he would not change the state of the stinging in them in the description of the parties (P-125) who is the one who is the same, and what is the same, and what is the same, Received the Messenger ﷺ and for the believers because this saying is their command in faith, standing on his creation, the Almighty, and his disappearance is not upon him, and it is not a man who does not.Another side, which is its greatness, is the Almighty to their guilt in the deprivation from where they did it while they knew his health, and if it was from his creation, then they would not know that they did not know That was added to the excess of the prohibition to them on the face of the vigor, which indicates that, and know that the words have to be presented as a virginity and eclipses, so there is no abundance in the return.The second question: Abu Bakr al -Razi said: The verse indicates that the scientist who suffers from it is a distance of adults and is close to the people of the ignorant; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: they are old to believe in you to benefit the removal of the tension in their rationality to their greatness, after the knowledge.
