The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: And when we said, enter this village, so eat from it where you will, and enter the door in prostration, and say a cow, we will be forgiven The good people, and those who wronged changed a saying other than those who were said to them, so we revealed us to those who wronged, who were broken from the sky, as they were the one who did not know.This verse is given to the advanced blessings because it is exalted as he has shown his blessings on them by that he shadowed them from the dignity and he was from the one who is from them and from them [from them] The urgent followed him with his blessings on them in the door of religion, where he commanded them with what they wipe out their sins and explained to them the way of the separated from what they wanted.And know that the words in this verse are on two types: the first type: what is related to interpretation, so we say: As for his saying, the Almighty is: “And we say:“ He will enter it.” An upright thing, and it is indicated by Jahan: The first: that it is the highest of the entry of the door, and this is a hard work, so the matter was with it, and the door is not.With the entry of the village, and what is not required is only for it, it is obligatory, so it has proven that the matter is the entry of the village is a majestic matter, not a permissible matter.The second: that he said: Enter the sanctified land that God has written for you and do not renew your lines [Al -Maaidah: 21] indicate what we mentioned.As for the village, the Qur’an shows the Qur’an, it does not indicate its eyes, but rather returns in that to the news, and it contains sayings: one of them: He is the choice of Qatada, Al -Raba’i, and my father, the Muslim The sanctuary, and infer upon him, with his words, in the Surah Al -Muddah: Enter the sanctified earth that God has written for you [Al -Ma’idah: 21] and there is no doubt One.And the second: it is the same as Egypt.And the third of it: It is the saying of Ibn Abbas and Abu Zaid that it is a rest and it is a close to the house of the sanctuary, and these are transmitted that it is not permissible to be that of the village (P-83) Because the fulfillment in his saying is up to the Almighty: it changed those who have been wronged, which requires the punishment, so it is necessary for that to be a slope of them, and this matter is in this matter.The land of the end, and it did not enter the house of the sanctuary, so it was proven that it is not intended from this village with the sanctuary of the sanctuary.And the first answered that it is not in this verse that we said, “Enter this village on the tongue of Moses or on the tongue of Yusha, and if we carry it on the tongue of the tongue, it will be disturbed.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: So eat from it where you will be a desire, so his interpretation has passed in the story of Adam, peace be upon him, which is a matter of permissibility.As for the saying of the Exalted: And enter the door in a prostration, and it is in the end: The door is called from a house holy.And secondly: The deaf narrated from each other that it was a matter of the door of the village and entering it.The second: They disappeared in the intention of the prostration, and the good said: He wanted the soul of the prostration that is the attachment of the face to the land, and this is far from that it is the same The prostration, so if we carried the prostration on its backs, it would not be forbidden, and among them is those who carried it on the other than the prostration, and these are mentioned and Jahin: the first: the first: Ibn Abbas that what is meant is the knees; Because the door was a narrow, narrow, in which the inside need to bend, and this is a distance because if it was narrow, they would have been obliged to enter it, so it was a knee.The second: He wanted to be subjected to the one who is close to him; Because when he excused his pregnancy on the truth of the prostration, it must be carried on the humility; Because, if they take in repentance, then repent to the sin, it is necessary to be subject to adherent.As for the saying of the Exalted: And they said a cow, and it is in its faces: one of them: and it is the saying of the judge: the meaning is that it is up to the Almighty after that they were entrusted to the entry of the door on the face The repentance, and that is because the repentance is the row of the heart, so it is not possible for others to come to it.Watch the sin; Because the repentance does not fulfill it except with it, as it is the most correct of its repentance, and if the words are not found, but for the sake of the definition of others, it is not the same The accusation about itself, and so who is known to be a sin, then the truth is revealed to him, for he is obligated to know his brother, who is the one who knows the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who knows the sinner On the authority of him, to remove the accusation about him in steadfastness on falsehood and to return to his loyalty after his revenues, for this reason, God Almighty is the Lord of the Lord of the Lord, with the righteousness Remember the indicative memory of that repentance, which is his saying: and say a cow, so he has the same thing that the people would enter the door on the face Sins land until they are universal between the hearts of the heart and the subjugation of the wounds and the forgiveness of the tongue, and this face is the best of the faces and its closeness.Second: The saying of the deaf: This is the word of the book of the book, that is, it is not known in the Arabic.And the third of it: The owner of the scouts said “Hatta” is a verb from the land, such as the sitting and the knees, and it is a starting news that is deleted.In the sense of our sins, our sins were removed from us, but it was raised to give the meaning of stability as its saying: a beautiful patience, so we are all over and the patience is a patience, and the patience is good.The son of Abi Abla is in line.And its seed: the saying of Abu Muslim Al -Asfahi, which is our command, is a cow, that is, to be degraded in This village and settled in it, and the judge has fulfilled that that he said: If (P-84) was intended for that, there was no forgiveness for their sins, and he said: We forgive you, your sins, indicate that the forgiveness of sins was for the sake of their saying, and it is possible to answer it.With the humility, the forgiveness was attached to it.Fifth: the saying of the lock: God is interested in our sins, for we are degraded to your face and the will of humiliation to you, and our sins are removed from us.If he said: Was it the cost and a response to the remembrance of this memory with its eyes or not?We narrated from Ibn Abbas that they were commanded by this memorial with its eyes, and this is an innervil, but the closeness is its disagreement for the two people: one of them: They were speaking in Arabic.And secondly: It is the closeness that they were commanded that they say a saying that indicates the repentance, the regret, and the subjugation until they said if they said: And we repent to you, so the intended is having; Because the intended is from the repentance, either the heart or the tongue, the heart is the denomination, and the tongue is a remembrance of the word that indicates the peak of the denomination in the heart and not to the heart of the heart and not A memorizer with her eyes.As for the saying of the Almighty: We forgive you, so the words in the forgiveness may be presented.Then here is the one: the first: that his saying: We forgive you, God Almighty mentioned in the disposal of the two of the two, and if the acceptance of the repentance was the one who is a reason for the mind of the mind The matter was not like that, but it was a performance for the duty and the performance of the duty, its male is not permissible in the disposal of the two.The second: We are readings: one of them: Abu Amr and Ibn al -Munadi read the noun and the breaking of fulfillment.And the second: a navigator read and open it.And the third of it: the rest of the people of the city have read and the mountain of the preference for the vigilance, its annexation, and the conquest of fulfillment.And the one who was seen: Al -Hasan, Qatada, Abu Hayyah and Al -Jahdari read, and the conquest of fulfillment.Al -Qafal said: The meaning in these readings is all one; Because the sin, if God forgives her, is forgiven, and if it is forgiven, then God will forgive her, and the verb if the feminine name is presented and the condition of the feminine and the condition between him Remembering and singing as his saying: He took the oppressors of the shouting [Hood: 67] and what is meant by the sin of the gender is not the one who is the same.As for his words, the Exalted: Your sins have readings: one of them is: Al -Jahiri reads, “Your Sins” with a period of concern and a mourning after the time.And the second: The meanings “your sins” with a period of concern and a thousand after the hamsti before the vit.And the third of it: the good is like that, but it raises the v.And the sequence of it: The Kasayi is your sins with a hoofing, after the lean, before the ya.Fifth: Ibn Kathir With a hasty gossip after ya and before the kaf.And its sixth: the zakary by breaking the lean and the water, and those with the affairs of the ya only.As for the saying of the Exalted: We will increase the good, but it is what is meant by the good one who was good with obedience in this cost, or whoever is a good man.Calgianum.As for the first estimation: the leadership can be one of the benefits of the world and be among the benefits of religion.As for the first indifference: that it is one of the benefits of the world, the meaning is that whoever is good at this obedience is that we increase it with the world and the one who is unhappy with it.The village, and the second indifference: is that it is one of the benefits of the hereafter, so the meaning is that whoever is good with this obedience and the repentance, then we forgive him and we will be forgiven for him The forgiveness of sins is to give the rewarding reward as he said: For those who have good goodness and a increase [Yunus: 26], that is, we reward them with charity and goodness as he made Ten and more than that, but if it is intended from the “good” whoever is good with other obstacles after this repentance, then the meaning is that we will make the meaning of you.Included, and your saying is a force influencing in the forgiveness of sins, then if you come after that with other obedience, give you the reward for that extra obedience.And in the verse is another interpretation, which is that the meaning of those who were wrong, we have forgiven him of his sin with this act, and whoever was not wrong, but he was more good in our goodness, His good deeds and increased his increase in us, so the forgiveness will be for the believers and the leadership of the obedient.As for the saying of the Exalted: He replaced those who wronged, and he said: The first: The father of a Muslim said: The Almighty said: So he changed it to what they did not do.They came to him with a substitute, and the evidence has to be said that the saying may be used in the violation.To replace the words of God [Al -Fateh: 15] and they did not turn them out except the dispute in the verb, not in the saying, so it is like this, so the meaning is that they are not commanded, and the question is that they are not.They did not follow the command of God, and they did not fulfill it.The second: It is the saying of the philosophers of the interpreters: that what is meant is from the extermination that they came with a substitute for him because the trial is derived from al -Badil, so it is not possible, and it is not possible, so it is necessary, so it is necessary, so it is necessary, and it is necessary, and it is necessary, and it is necessary for this.So, so he changed his religion, he benefits that he was transferred from one debt to another debt, and that is confirmed by the words What was something?It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that they entered the door that they commanded to enter in it a prostration, crawling, with their end Pura, and on the authority of Mujahid that they entered on their lines and said: a truly jam, and Ibn Zaid said: A mockery of Mossi; And they said: Moses is what he wants to play with us except for our cow, that is, anything.As for the saying of the Exalted: Those who wronged them, but God described them with that, either because they sought to be a shortage of their goods in the world and the religion, or because they were lost, and they are lost.What was presented.As for his words, the Almighty: He descended on those who have been unjust from the sky, so they have two things: the first: that in Takirir: those who have been wronged in a increase in That the abandonment of their oppression of their oppression.The second: that the ritual is the torment, and the evidence is upon him, the Almighty saying: And when the ritual argued against them, that is, the holy one, and so is the saying of the Almighty: Al -Zajaj mentioned that the ritual and the abomination are one of them, and it is the torment.* * * As for his saying: It is gone away from you.Then, that of the wise thing is anything that was not a sign of the verse on him, so Ibn Abbas said: He died from them with the suddenness of four and ten years in one hour, and he said: The plague has until he died from the morning to the evening, five and ten times, and no one remained from them.As for the saying of the Exalted: What they were immoral, then immorality is from the harmful erasure, it is said that the wetness is stolen if it comes out of its scales and on the part of the veil from the abode His disobedience, Abu Muslim said: This immorality is the darkness that is mentioned in his saying, the Almighty: on those who wronged and exalted, the righteousness is affirming, and the truth is the right.For the two: the first: that the injustice may be from the listener, and it may be from the cabarets, and for that, God has described the prophet with the darkness in our saying: [Al-Araf: 23] And if the injustice would not be great, the great remembrance of the deceased was a frequency, and the immorality must be from (P-86) the lipids, so what is the same as the one who described them, and he described them.In the second, immorality is to know that their injustice was from the lipids, not from the listening.The second: It is impeded that they deserve the name of the oppressor in the cause of that.Before that, and on this direction, the repetition will be removed.The second type of speech in this verse: Know that God is the Almighty mentioned this verse in the wall of the norms, and he said: And when they were said to them, they will be silent.You will say a cow, and enter the door, prostrate, forgive you, your sin, we will increase the good.They have a reward from the sky as they were oppressing [Al -Araf: 161] And know that one of the people who is invoked by the Almighty saying: He changed those who wronged that what was responded to by the eagerness of the dhikr is that it is not the same.Other than that, and perhaps the companions of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, may not be permissible to forbid the prayer with the memorial of glorification and praise, and it is not permissible.Al -Razi is that they deserved to be blamed for their way of saying to another saying that is contrary to the first meaning of the first, so they do not go to the slander, so what is the one who is not.The meaning is not like that.The answer is that the appearance of his saying: So it changed those who wronged a saying other than those who were said to them, and everyone who changed a saying with another saying is the one who said: They agreed, and here we are asking: the first question: Why did he say in Surah al -Qarah: And when he said and said in the norms: And when they were told [Al -Arif: 160].The answer is that God Almighty stated at the beginning of the Qur’an that he said this saying is God Almighty to remove the dignity and because he was mentioned in the first words: Remember the blessings of you [Al -Qarra: 47] Then he took a number (his blessing) as a blessing, so the one who drew this place to say: And when he said, but in the wall of the nams, he does not stay in the saying [Al -Araf: 161] Implementation after the permission of the expression of it in the cow surah.The second question: Why did he say in the cow: And when we said, enter and in the norms: Squeeze [Al -Araf: 161]?.Answer: The income is presented to the silence, and it is not necessary for them, so the income is mentioned in the advanced surah and the silence in the late surah.The third question: Why did he say in the cow: So eat in fulfillment and in the norms: Eat [Al -Araf: 31] Waw?.The answer here is what we mentioned in the saying of the exalted in Surah al -Qarra: and each of them is a slave and in the norms: so do not know [Al -Arif: 19].The fourth question: Why did he say in the cow: We forgive you your sins and in the norms: We forgive you your sins [Al -Arif: 161].Answer: Sins are the collection of many and sins.He chose to be a couple with what he met with his quality and generosity, which is the forgiveness of many sins, so he mentioned the memory of the gathering that indicates the many, and in the naughty, but it was not the same He said: And when it was said to them [Al -Araf: 161] There is no crime that was mentioned by the gathering of the few, so he has obtained that when the actor mentioned, he mentioned what he is honored by the abundance of God The actor is named, the indication is not mentioned.The fifth question: Why did he mention his saying: Rujdal in the cow and deleted it in the norms?.The answer to this question is like the answer (P-87) in sins and sins Because when the verb assigned to himself, there is no male with him the great year, which is that they eat, and in the norms, when the verb did not support it to the soul of the soul The greatest is in it.The sixth question: Why was it mentioned in the cow: And enter the door in prostration and say a cow and in the naughty, the late came to?.Answer: Waw for the divorced gathering and also, so those who addressed it by saying: and enter the door in prostration and say a cow, it is possible that it is said: if some of them were They were guilty, so the singer must be of his assumption of sins provided for the worship of worship because the repentance of the sin is the authority With the worshiping worship, there is no refinement, then there was no mandate that they would say first to say, "Power", and then they entered the door prostrating, and the one who is not the one who is not the one who does not He first works for worship and then reminds the repentance secondly on the way to digest the soul and remove the wonder in the act of that worship, so it is a matter First, then say a second snapshot.فَلَمّا احْتَمَلَ كَوْنُ أُولَئِكَ المُخاطَبِينَ مُنْقَسِمِينَ إلى هَذَيْنِ القِسْمَيْنِ لا جَرَمَ ذَكَرَ اللَّهُ تَعالى حُكْمَ كُلِّ واحِدٍ مِنهُما في سُورَةٍ أُخْرى.The seven question: Why did he say: We will increase the good in the cow with the waw and in the naughty: We will increase the improvement [Al -Arif: 161] from the wow?.The answer: As for the norms, it was mentioned in it two things: one of them: the saying of the power, which is a sign of the repentance.And the second: the entry of the door is prostrating and it is a sign of worship, then he mentioned angry: one of them: the saying of the Almighty: We forgive you for your sins while it is located in the metaphor.(And the other) His saying: We will increase the improvement and it is located in the interview of the entry of the door in a prostration, so the leaving of waw is the benefit of each one from the part of the part The two conditions.As for the wine of the cow, it is alienated as a group of forgiveness and the Ziyah is one of the actual group of the actual group.The eighth question: God Almighty said in the wall of the cow: So those who have been wronged and said in the norms: So he changed those who wronged them saying [Al -Araf: 161] “Who are” in the norms?.Answer: Because of the increase in this memorial in the wall of Al -Arif, that the first story is based on specialization with memorization, “because he is up to the one who said:“ Whoever is up to the mother of Moses ” With the truth and with it they adjust [Al -Araf: 159], so he mentioned that some of them do that, then the number of Sunnahs is upon them and the people of them, so he said: Those who wronged them [Al -Araf: 162] and he mentioned a memory: Who are the last of them as he mentioned it at the beginning The unjust from the people of Moses in the midst of The guilty of them is a normal nation, and here he mentioned a mighty nation and all of them from the people of Moses, so this is the reason for the remembrance of this word in the wall He did not remember in the verses before his saying: He changed those who have been unjust and specialized until he is obligated to the last story, so that the story is mentioned.The difference.The ninth question: Why did he say in the cow: So we descended on those who did wrong and said in the norms: So we sent us [Al -Arif: 162].Answer: The landing benefits its juveniles at the beginning of the matter and the Arasal benefits its authority over them and release it to them in the kidney, and that is what happens in the last.The tenth question: Why did he say in the cow: what they were immoral and in the norms: what they were wronged [Al -Arif: 161].The answer: It is up to what was clear in the cow of the cow, as the darkness of that immorality, was satisfied with the memorial of the darkness in the wall of the norms for the sake of what is presented in the lord of the lion Know.
