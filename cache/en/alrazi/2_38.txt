The researcher of the Quranic, his righteousness, and the Almighty said, “Get up from it all, so it comes to you from me.Remember in the abundance of release the matter with the despair and Jahin: The first: Al -Jubayi said: The first is the second, so the first is from paradise to the sky of the world.And the second is from the sky of the world to the earth, and this is weak from two sides: one of them: He said in the first stubbornness: And for you in the earth is stable, so if the stability was in the land, but the one is the one who is It was the remembrance of his saying: You have in the land stable and enjoyment [Al -Baqarah: 36] Aqeeb Al -Habib Al -Thani is the first.And secondly: that he said in the second Habout: they are tied to it and the guarantee in (from it) is a return to paradise.Thus, it is required as the second of Heaven.The second direction: that the confirmation is for the sake of the affirmation and I have a third face that is stronger than these two directions, which is that Adam and Hawiya when they came to the time The matter is under the authority, and it was signed in their heart that the matter of underwriting, when it was in the cause To know that the matter of hypnotics was not a penalty for the adoption of the costume until it goes away with its loudness, but the matter with the pressure remains after the repentance; Because the matter of it was a realization of the promising prepared in his saying: I am making in the land a successor [Al -Baqarah: 30] If it is said: What is the answer of the first condition?We said: The second condition is with his answer, as you say: If you come, then if I appreciate you, I would have improved to you.The second question: It was narrated in the news that Adam, peace be upon him.The third question: in “Al -Huda” Wahwah: One of them: What is meant by every indication and pyramid, so he enters into it the sign of the mind, and every word that comes down to a prophet, and in it The grace of God Almighty on Adam and Hawiya, as if he said: If you bound you from paradise to the earth, then I have blessed you with what he performs you once again.Al-Hassan said: (P-26) when Adam, peace be upon him, was lined up to the earth.Between me and between you, and a friend between you and between people, but for me, you worship me, do not share anything with me Supplication and the answer to me, and as for what is between you and among the people, then you will accompany them with what you love to accompany you with it.And the second: What was narrated from Abu Al -Aali is that what is meant is from the guidance of the prophets, and this is only if the addressee was saying: It comes to me from me, so that they are the offspring of his offspring and the sentence.The prophet is not a sign of this specialization.The following question: that it is high that he who followed his guidance with his right to know and do with the progress of what is obligatory and the sizes of what is forbidden; It becomes a state of no fear in it or sorrow, and this sentence is with its choice, it collects a lot of suffering from the suffering; Because his saying: Either you come from me, this is in which it entered into all of the mental evidence and the parties and the increases of the Bayan and the whole of what is not fulfilled only The ability, and his saying: Whoever follows my guidance, the evidence is contemplated with its right and the view in it, and the acquisition of the knowledge of it and the work of it, and it is all that, and it is all that, Fear against them, and they are not grieving all of what God has prepared for his guardians; Because the disappearance of fear includes peace from all pests, and the demise of sorrows requires the arrival to all the pleasures and wills, and the fear of fear is before the Because the disappearance of what does not want to be submitted to the request of what is empty, and this indicates that the cost of God that obeyed God Almighty does not attach him to the grave, nor with the grave, nor from the grave, nor from the grave, nor from the grave, nor from the grave, nor from the grave, nor from the The standing, nor when the books are evolved, nor when the budget is not established, nor is it when the path is as God Almighty said: The greatest is the greatest of them, and this is the greatest and the ritual Which you were promising [the prophets: 103] and a people from the speakers said: The rituals of resurrection are as they reach the infidels and immorality, they also reach the believer.You see it, so that every breastfeeding woman is brightly.He was increased in the time with what he found from the sleeve, and this is weak; Because his saying: They do not grieve them greater, more special than his saying: on the day you see it, every breastfeeding woman is grateful for what is broken and the private is presented to the year.And Ibn Zaid said: There is no fear for them before them, so nothing is great in the chest of the one who dies from after death, so God Almighty has forgotten them.Then they asked them about the world and said: They are not saddened by what they left after their death in the world, for if it was said: “Whoever follows my guidance, then they are not, then they are not.The denial of fear and sorrow requires divorced in the world and the hereafter, and the matter is not like that; Because they were obtained in the world for the believers more than their obtaining themselves for other believers, peace and blessings be upon him said: Also, the believer cannot be cut off The shortcomings are located, and the fear of the poor is the hall of the punishment.And for that, God told them that they said when they entered Paradise: Praise be to God, who gave us sorrow from us, if our Lord is forgiven, a thank you [34] And the agreement in the world is not to miss the generosity of God, which we have now.The fifth question: The judge said: His exalted say: Whoever follows my guidance, then there is no fear for them, nor are they grieving, and they will not be guided (P-27) on the things: one of them: So he said: Whoever follows my guidance.And the second: the saying of the saying that the acquaintance is a warning.And the third of it: that the guidance of the guidance deserves paradise.And the sequence of it: the heroes of the conventional; Because the imitator is not followed by Hoda.
