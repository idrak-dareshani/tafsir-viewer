The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: The faces of a raid, the lath said: The colors, the tree, and the paper are fresh, the freshness, and the freshness, the good, the good, the good, and the good Everything, and from it it is said to the color if it is an outlook: is a freedom, so it is said: a fresh green, and so in all the colors, and its meaning, which has a lightning, and that is a lightning, and that is a lightning, and so And a fresh floor.And from him, peace be upon him, said: “God is a servant who heard my article,“ The Hadith.” The most narrated narrators narrated by lightness, and Akrama narrated from Al -Asma’i in which tension, and the conservatives of the interpreters are different in the interpretation of the one who said: (P-200) Performed, soft, subjugated, shown, with a glow.Al -Zajaj said: It was fresh with the righteousness of paradise, as he said: They are known in their faces.To her Lord, I see that the people of the Sunnah are gathered in this verse in evidence that the believers see God, the day of the Day of Resurrection.As for the disgraceful, they are two men: one of them: Bayan that his appearance does not indicate the vision of God Almighty.The second: Bayan Al -Tawil.As for the first place: they said: The view of the rituals of “to“ is not a name for the vision, but rather the presenter For his vision, and look at the eye on the vision, as the heart of the lineage to the knowledge, and as well as listening to the lineage to the hearing, so that we look For the knowledge, and the listening is an advance of the hearing, so the eyes of the eye are presented to the vision, they said: And who indicates that the view is not a name for the one who is the first: Hope: And you see them look at you while they do not see [Al -Arif: 198] The second: that the view describes what the vision does not describe, it is said: We look at it as a look, and the look of anger, and a satisfied look, and all of that is for the sake This is the case, and the vision does not describe anything of that, so it is not said: He saw it as a ritual, and he saw it as an angry, or a satisfied vision.The third: It is said: Look at it until you see it, and I looked at it and I saw it, and this is the benefit of the view of the vision of an absence, and that is required.Al -Rabaa: It is said: The role of the sons of so -and -so -looking, that is, an opposite, so it is called the view, and we have the name, and the name is called.Fifth: The saying of the poet: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ام ام X.Sixth: Abu Ali Al -Farisi brought the view that it is not a light from the vision that is the realization of insight, but it is a burden on the conversion of the one who is the one who is the one The thing that his vision wants is the saying of the poet: ؎ What is the water of my crying with the same as his emery He who is among him is among the sides, he said: If if the view was a light on the vision, the penalty was not asked for it, because the loved one did not ask for the reward.If this is one of its most demands, he said: It is indicated by that, too We have the side in which the loved ones, so we have learned with this face that the view of the ritual is a rhythm "to" it is not a name for the vision.The sword: that his saying: to her Lord, a view that means that she looks at her Lord in particular and does not look at otherwise, and this is the meaning of the act of the verb, not to see it, to the saying Standardized [Resurrection: 12], to your Lord, then the course [Resurrection: 30], except to God, the affairs of the matters [Al -Shura: 53], and to Him you will return [Al -Zakarf: 85] It was reluctant to him, and I have a sinner [Al -Shura: 10] How to be able to adhere to the meaning of the choice.The number (p-201) is in the standing of the resurrection, because the believers are the counterpart of that day because they are the safe ones who are not afraid of them, nor are they grieving [62] On that the view is only to God, and the mind indicates that they see other than God, we know that what is meant from the view of God is not the vision.The eighth: The Almighty said: He does not look at them on the day of resurrection [Al -Amran: 77] and if he said: He does not see them as enough, so when he denied the look, and he did not deny the vision of the one who is the one who is the same, so the vision is the same.The faces, that the remarkable view of this verse is not the vision.The second place: in the two detailed interpretation, which is from two faces: the first: that the view be in the sense of the expected, that is, those who are waiting for the sake of God Rather, I look at it so and so, and the meant is waiting for its success from his face, and he said: So, the view is what the messengers return to the messengers [Al -Nimal: 35] and he said: Misra [Al -Baqara: 280] It is not said: The pronounced view of a rhythm is “to“ other than uses in the sense of waiting, and because the waiting is cloud and the mother, and it does not meet the people of the Because we say: The answer is about the first of two faces: the first: the view, who are counted with a letter, "to" it may be used in the sense of waiting and the signs, and the sorrow is that I am, and it is the one who is.It is made by me, and it is intended from it, and the poet said: ؎ If I look at you from a king ∗∗∗ and the sea without you increased me as a blessing and achieve the words in it They said in waiting, “I looked“ without a link, but that is in the waiting for the one who comes to the person with himself, but if he is waiting for his soul, then he is not.In it: I looked at him; The saying of the man: Rather, we look at God then to you, and this may say that whoever does not see, and he says the blind in the same way as this meaning: my eyes are not for you, for you We receive that what is meant from “to“ is the letter of transgression, but it is one of the families, and the meaning: the faces of the day are fresh, the grace of its Lord is waiting.As for the second question: that the waiting is cloud and pain, its answer is that the expected if it is waiting for it to be on the authority of the prayer to it, then it will be in it.The second one: that the added, and the meaning: to the reward of her Lord is a view, they said: Rather, we became to this interpretation; Because when the thunderbolt and the mentality indicated that it is the highest that his vision believes that the destiny must be interpreted, and the saying is that he said: That the view is not expressive of the conversion of the height, because it is an adult who said: He does not look at them, and it is not intended that he is the height of the threat to the hell, so that he is the one who is the hell, so that he is the one who is the hell, so that he is the one who is the hell, so that he is the hell, so that he is the hell, so that he is the one who does not To them we look at the mercy, that was our answer to what they said.The third interpretation: that the meaning of her Lord be the view that she does not ask and does not want only to God, and he is what is meant by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: The people of the resurrection of the severity of their rushes to it and the obedience of their brilliance from others, they became as if they were looking at it.Answer: Its saying: It is not a sign of vision.Peace be upon him, who is his saying: Look at you [Al-Araf: 143] If he had a reflection of the conversion of the delicacy to the side (P-202), the visionary, it was necessary for the verse that the peace be upon him.You have proven to God Almighty, and this is a referral.The second: He made the look a result of the will, so the view is delayed from the will, and the conversion of the height is unlikely to be delayed from the will, so the will is that the will is not.Explain the conversion of the delicacy to the side of the visual.* * * His right to his right, and his causation must be carried out, and he is ahead of the name The reversal of the height is like the cause of vision and does not relate between it and between the waiting, so his pregnancy was on the vision of his lighter on the one.Either [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
