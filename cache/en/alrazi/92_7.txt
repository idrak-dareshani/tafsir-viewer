The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: Your endeavor is the disappearance of this, the division of the division, so the highest of these things divided this, that his worship is a disagreement, and that is a disagreement in the part, Distinguish like a satisfactory and satisfactory, but it was said to the different: dispersed, to be a darkening between each other and some of it, and the diaspora is the domestication and the burning of it Some of them are some of them; Because some of it is a misguidance and some of it is guided, and some of it requires the paradise, and some of it obligates fire, so they are between them, and it is close to this verse: And the companions of Paradise [Al -Hashr: 20] and his saying: Whoever was believed to be the one who was pastures who did not equate [Al -Sajdah: 18] and his saying: Or the one who calculated those who have wounded the sins that we have made them like that And they did the righteous, whether their lives and their deaths, worsened what they judge [Al -Jathiya: 21] and he said: Neither the shadow nor the freedom [Fatir: 21] The interpreters said: This verse was revealed in Abu Bakr.Then, it is a grace between the meaning of the destruction of the work, as we said it from the burnt punishment, the defamatory, the reward, and the punishment, so he said: So whoever is given and the one who was given and the one who is given and the one who is given and believed it For the family, but whoever dislocated, took advantage of, and lied to goodness, and we will facilitate the Asri.In his saying, “He gave” and Jahan: One of them is that what is meant is to spend money in all the faces of goodness from the eagerness of the neck, the dismantling of the captives, and the strength of the Muslims, as well as the Muslims.The father of a good man did it, and this was a duty, or the release of this, like the release of his saying: From what we have agreed upon, they will spend [Al -Qasas: 54], so that is what is wrong with it.The path of God, whether it was obligatory or not, and the praise of God is a people, and he said: They feed the food on his love, holding, and hidden and captive [the human being: 8] It will be avoided by the righteous, who will bring his money to zakat and no one has a grace that is rewarded (P-181), except for the face of his upper Lord [night: 17].And secondly: that his saying: He was given to be given to give the rights of money and give the souls of the soul in the obedience of God Almighty, it is said: So and so gave obedience and gave the capacity.And his saying: And he feared, as it is a reference to the exclusion from everything that is not empty, and we have mentioned that it is from the condition of his universe to be a conquest of the elderly, not?In the interpretation of his words, the Almighty is: guidance for the righteous [Al -Baqarah: 2].And his saying: It is true of goodness, so the good is in it.That is because it is not beneficial with the infidels to give money or the absence of a inception, and it is like his saying: or a food on a day with a desired one [Al -Balad: 14] to his saying: And secondly: Al -Hasan is a phrase of what God imposed on the worship of worship on the forefront and in the money as if it was said: He was given in The path of God, and he feared the incest, and believed in the parts, so he knew that he was upset and did not legitimize it except because of the faces of goodness and goodness.And the third of it: that the good is the successor that God promised him in his saying: What you have agreed from something, then it is left behind [Saba: 39] and the meaning: He was given from his money in the obedience Good, and that he said: The example of those who spend their money in the path of God [Al -Baqarah: 261], so the successor was when it was increased, it was true for the sake of this And he lied to the good, that is, it was not believed in succession, so he stoke his mind to misunderstanding him with the servants, as he said each other: He prohibited the miserable, He said: “There is no day in which the sun is strange, except for a place that calls them to hear them, all of them created all of them except the two gossip: O God, give all the hypocrisy.” And its elevation: that the good is the reward, and it was said: He is the paradise, and the meaning is one, Qutdah said: He believed in the bases of God, so he did for that, and he said: For a sake of nine, a good character, God Almighty said: Say: Do you give us only one of the two Hassan We have a good in it [Al -Shura: 23], so he called the wandering of goodness, and he said: I have a good man.[Chapter: 50].* * * As for his saying: He will facilitate him for the family, and he has angios: the first question: in the interpretation of this word, it is: one of them.And the second: It is good, and they said in Al -Asri: It is the evil.And the third of it: it is intended for him to make it easy for him to do all of the verbs and the rituals, and it is intended from the Asri, all of that is difficult for him.And the one who is seen: the captain is the return to the obedience that he came first, as if he said that he would be pleased to return to giving in the path of God, and they said: In the Asri, it is against that He returns to miserliness and abstinence from the performance of financial rights.Al -Qafal said: And for all these faces is a metaphor of the language, and that is because the work is with the salesman Releted and enforced matters, for that is from the secret, and that is the description of all obedience, and everything that led his punishment to hardship and tired, so it is from the Asri, and that is all the sins.The second question: the obedience in the memorial of the captains and the memorization of the Asri in it in it.The intended one was a one who returned to the ritual or the verb, and on this one who made “Yassar” is the facilitator Al -Awad [E], as if he said: We will facilitate the curtain [that] which is such.And the second: to be a reference Return to the way, as if he said: (P-182) for the chrome and Asri.And the third of them: that worship is difficult matters of body, then if the cost knows that they lead to paradise, those hard actions are easy for him, with the grace of it, So God called the Heaven to seek, and then the family of the captive in the performance of obedience to this family.And his saying: We will facilitate it for the right to the one.The third question: In the sense of the teaser for the family and the Asri, it is guided by it: and that is because whoever interpreted the family with paradise, then it is easy for the sake to the one who is in.Paradise with ease and dignity, according to what God has informed of his saying: And the angels enter them from each chapter, peace be upon you [Al -Raad: 23] Khalidin [Al -Zumar: 73] and his saying: Peace be upon you with what you have been patient, so that the burden of the house [Al -Raad: 24].Until he does not accommodate him from the heaviness of what the affiliates and the hypocrites of the lazy, God Almighty said: It is a greatness except on the bereavens [Al -Baqarah: 45] and he said: And if they pray: And he said: What if you are said to you, you will escape in the path of God, you will be burdened to the earth [Tawbah: 38], so the Taysir was the activation.The following question: The companions infer this verse on the correctness of their saying in the success and the misfortune, so they said: If his saying is up to the Almighty: He is the Almighty, who specialized in the believer with this success, which is that he made obedience to the lineage to him is more likely than disobedience, and his saying: He is a good man.The disbeliever in this misfortune, which is that he made disobedience to the lineage to it, is more likely from the obedience, and if the verse is indicated by the rituals of the righteous, then it is necessary for the sake of the saying that there is no one.The verb and the blessing, and it is known that the state of leveling is the reason for the rituals, so the righteous is the first of the abstinence, and if one of the two parties is forbidden, there is no one.It was left for my contradictions.The lock - may God have mercy on him - replied on the face of the grabbing of the verse of his face Like it [Al -Shura: 40] and he said: He preached to them with a painful torment [Al -Imran: 21] So when God called the act of the ritual kindness to obedience, it is a way to the one who is the name For the Asri.And the second: that this be on the one hand to add the verb to the caused by it without the actor.As it was said in the idols: Lord, they are a lot of people [Ibrahim: 36].And the third of it: that this be on the way to judge it and the news about it and the answer: It is for all that it is a matter of the appearance, and that is not permissible, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Either we have indicated that the phenomenon on our part is confirming the mind of the strong, then our companions have confirmed the apparent of this verse with what was narrated from the authority of the Prophet.He said: “There is no soul that is inclined, except that God has taught its place of paradise and fire, our saying: Do we not eat?He said: No, do every easy entire person when he was created for him.56] Know that this is weak because he is peace be upon him, but he mentioned this answer to their question, meaning work, so all of us are easy, and he agreed with the knowledge of God That what God has destroyed is on the servant and his knowledge of it, for it is the prohibition of alienation, and God knows.The fifth question: In the entry of the Sunnah in his saying: His facilitation is his faces: one of them: that he is on the way of way of ways His saying: Worship your Lord to his saying, that you may fear (P-183) [Al-Baqarah: 21].And the second: that it is carried out that the obedient may become disobedient, and the disobedient may become a depleted dress, for this reason was that it was enrolled in it.And the third of it: that the reward when the most of it was located in the hereafter, and that was what his time did not come, and no one stands on his time except God, there is no crime, and he entered his entry.Because it is a screaming letter to indicate that that the promise is not present, and God knows.
