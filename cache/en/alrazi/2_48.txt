The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: Fear one day, do not reward a soul for the same thing, and it is not accepted from an intercession, and it is not taken from it as just as they do not support.That day from punishment and hardship; Because the soul of the day is not up to the people of Paradise and the fire all.What is meant is what we mentioned, then it is the highest and the day was described as the tightening of the characteristics and the greatest of them, and that is because the Arabs, if one of them is pushed to his unpleasant, and tried to the one who has been deflected by the soles What is in her patriarchal spores is the necessity of the protector, so she flies from him as the father dissolves from his son with the intention of his strength, for if he sees those who have no energy with him And the Sunnahs of the ritual, then he was in the millions of what he did not fail, for if the two cases were not singled out for him from roughness and the two, and he did not remain after it.Or otherwise, and if these three are not singing from it, it is the most prominent of what they hope for the victory of the brother The criminals in the hereafter.The remainder of this synagogine is two questions: The first question: The benefactor is from his saying: Do not reward a soul from the same thing that is the one who says it: nor are they Repeat?And the answer: What is meant by his saying: Do not reward a soul from the same thing that he does not bear it otherwise, otherwise what he is obligated to from part The judgment of the punishment, and we will remember another difference, if God wills, may He be exalted.The second question: God Almighty presented in this verse the acceptance of the rivalry on taking the ransom, and mentioned this verse in this surah after the tenth Fudity on the male of the intercession, so what is the rule is in it?The answer: That whoever has his mile to love money is more severe than his miuk to the same soul, then he presents the holding of the two companions to give the ransom, and whoever is in the face of the one who is in the face Interest, the use of the chain of transmission, the reference to these two classifications: Let us now remember the breath Al -Qaflal said: The origin is in the reward of this when the people of the language spent, and from the hadith, “The Messenger of God ﷺ said to my father, the son of the son of Yaar:“ You will reward you.” This is how the people of the Arabism narrate: The same thing is nothing and does not carry anything from it, but the woman will be spared from his brother, his mother and his father, and this is the meaning of this penis that the obedience of the obedience is not to be the one who is not.And this penis has fall Debt and bearing it from him, but the day of resurrection is that the judgment is eliminated, but it falls in it from good deeds.Abu Hurairah narrated that he said: “May God bless him be upon him:“ The mercy of God, and he had a darkness in his brother.Dinar and no dirham, if it has good deeds that took from his good deeds, and if he had no good, he has a good time.The owner of the scouts said: (P-52) and (something) is an act of it and it is permissible to be in the position of the source of a source, that is, a little of the penalty, such as his saying: He read: “It is not rewarded” who is more rewarded for him if he is richer from him, so he will not be in his readers except in the sense of anything from the parts, and this sentence is the same as the place.If it was said: Who is the one who is from it to the description?Say: It is a deleted manner that is not rewarded in it, and the meaning of denying is that a soul of the same is not rewarded for the same thing.To be reassured.As for his saying: It is not accepted from it, the reaction is that one of the things is given to anyone, and it is required for him a need, and the origin of it from the height that is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one Frague, and the lips became a healing, that is, a husband.He knows that the guilt is in his saying: It is not accepted from it a return to the second disobedient soul, which is not taken from it, and the meaning is not accepted from it, if it comes to the reaction that it comes to the verge that it comes to the verge that it comes to the verge that it comes to the verge that it comes with a verb.It is accepted from it, and it is permissible to return to the first breath, if it had interceded, it would not accept its reaction as it is not rewarded for anything.As for the saying of the Exalted: It is not taken from it as a ransom, and the origin of the word is from the equivalent of something that says: What amended with one of the so -and -so, that is, I do not see a counterpart.He said: Then those who disbelieved in their Lord, they adjust [Al -Ma’idah: 36] and his counterpart is this verse.With him, to redeem him from the torment of the day of resurrection, what is accepted from them [Al -Ma’idah: 36] and the Almighty said: Those who disbelieve and died while they are disbelievers, and you will not accept one of them.With it [Al -Imran: 91] and he said: If every justice is not taken from it [Al -Anam: 70].As for his saying, “They are not victorious, I know that the victory is in the world with mixing and kinship, and God has informed God that there is no one who is not a good Between them, but the woman escapes from his brother, his mother, his father and his closeness, the lock said: The victory is intended by the cursed as his saying: The relief: The Arabs say: a mocked land, that is, a developed, and the absurdity will support the country if it is an alarm, as if it is the relief of its people, and it was said in his saying: [Hajj: 15] That is, he will not give him as The cloud is provided for the country, and the fee is called a victory and a victory.Excellency: Nor are they supporting, and this is the day of resurrection, and they are not reluctant, and it is necessary that if they are tormented, they would not find those who are in the past, and in the authority of the one who is in the authority of God The payment of hardships, so God Almighty told that there is no payment of there from his torment, and he remained in the verse two questions: the first question: that in the verse, the greatest of the sake The disagreement of the human being is from disobedience to the repentance; Because if you perceive that it is not after the death, there is no repetition, no victory, or a ransom, he knows that there is no salvation except by obedience, so if it is not a matter of obedience, then if there is no one who does not believe The worship, and whoever fulfills the repentance from where it does not live for him in the survival, has become a disgraceful caution in every case, and the verse, and if it is in the children of the Israel, it is in the meaning of the one who addresses it.Because the description in which it was mentioned and a description for the day, and that is blessed by everyone who is attending that day.The second question: The nation has gathered that Muhammad ﷺ is an intercession in the hereafter, and he was carried on that of his saying: May God bless you with a shrine.[79] And the Almighty said: And to give you your Lord, and you are satisfied [Al -Duha: 5] Then they disappeared after this in that his reaction to peace be upon him for whom you will be (P-53) for the reward, or will the people of the captives be fulfilled for the punishment?So the dismissed gone on the fact that it is for those who deserve the reward and the effect of the intercession in obtaining an increase in the benefits on the destiny of what they deserved, and he said: The overthrow of the torment of those who are eligible for punishment, either that they intercede for them in the row of resurrection until they do not enter the fire, and if they enter the fire, then they will be broken from it And enter paradise and agreed on that it is not for the disbelievers, and the dismissal was inferred on the recklessness of the people of the people On the negation of the intercession of three directions: the first: the saying of the Almighty: Do not reward a soul from the same thing, and if the rush was impressed in the overthrow of the punishment, the punishment of the punishment is the one who is the one who has been punished for the punishment of the punishment.The same thing.The second: Its words are said: It is not accepted from it, and this is a denial in the denial of the negation, so all kinds of rivalry are blessed.The third: His Exalted: Nor are they supported, even if he was a lifeline of one of the disobedience, he would be supportive of him, and that is on the contradiction of the verse.The words are not said to the verse from two faces: The first: that the Jews were claiming that their fathers interceded for them, so they would not be from that, so the verse came down to them.The second: that the appearance of the verse requires the negation The specialization of specialization to it in the right to increase the reward for the people of obedience, so we also allocate it in the right of the Muslim who is the great of the slave of the two.Because we answer the first that the lesson is in general, not in particular the causes, and from the second that it is not permissible for what is meant from the verse is the negation of the rival Because he is a warning of that day that there is no benefit in it, and the warning will not be brought in it if the negation of the reaction is returned to the excess of the increase.Because the inclusion of the increase in the benefit is there is no danger and no harm, so it is clear that it is up to him, even if he said: Fear a day in which I do not increase the benefits He gets a mine of tin, and if he said: Fear a day in which I will be punished in the punishment of the one who deserves to be punished with an intercession of an intercession, then it was for you.The intended from the verse is the negation of the effect of the rhythm in the overthrow of the punishment, and we do not deny its effects in the increase in the benefits.And the second: His Excellency said: What the perseverance of those who are fools or analogy is obeyed [Ghafir: 18] and the shadow is the one who comes with the shadow The shadows have an lightening obedient and did not deny an enclosure that is answered and we say with it, because it is not in the last lips to be obeyed; Because the obedience will be above the obedient, and that it is above the exaggeration of one who obeyed God Almighty; Because we say: It is not permissible to hold the verse on what you said of two sides: The first: that knowledge is that it is not above it, one who obeyed it, who is agreed upon.As for those who have proven by his grace, they have recognized that he does not obey anyone, and as for those who exiled, he said the saying of the exile, it is impossible to be able to do it for it, so it is possible for it to be lost.This was the case of the verse of the verse on what you mentioned a pregnancy for it on an unavoidable meaning.The second: It is a transcendent exile, and the lipstick is only without the coded to him; Because whoever is on his authority is commanded for him and a rule over him and the same is not called an offense, then he said: “A lipstick” is without God without God His saying: He obeys [Ghafir: 18] on those above him, so he must carry him that what is meant by him is that they have no lips that are answered.And the third of it: His Exalted: It is before the day that there is no sale in it, no disturbance, or an intercession [Al-Baqarah: 254] Hope: And what the persons of the supporters of the supporters [Al -Baqarah: 270] If the Messenger would intercede for the metaphor of his nation, they would describe that they were victorious; Because if the messenger rises from the torment, then the Messenger has reached the end in his support.Fifth: His Excellency said: They do not intercede except for those who are satisfied [Al -Anbiya: 28] Tell the Almighty about his angels that they do not intercede for anyone, except that God is satisfied, And the evildoer is not with the exalted, and if the angels do not intercede for him, then the prophet, peace be upon them; Because he does not say the difference.And its sixth: His exaltation said: So what is the benefit of the two philosophers [Al -Muddathir: 48] and if the rush was impressed in the overthrow of the punishment, the reckoning would have benefited them.And the one who followed it: The nation is collected on that it is that we want to God Almighty to make us from the people of his rituals, peace be upon him, and they say in a sentence of God: His ritual.If he was eligible for the reaction, he was the one who came out of the world, Egypt, on Al -Kabir, and they would have wanted God to be exalted to conclude their Egyptians.It is not said that it is not permissible to say: They want to God to make them make them among the people of his ritual if they come out of Egypt, not that they want to conclude that They say in their prayers: Make us from the repentance and they will not want to be lost and then repent, but rather they want to spend them for the sake The two desires are a condition, and it is the assets and the submission of sins; Because we say: The answer to it is from two sides: (The first): It is not obligatory if we stipulate a condition in our saying: Oh God, make us among the twins, to increase the condition of us.Interest.(Al -Thani): The nation is in all the desires to God, they ask him to do what he will do with them what he connects to the desired in it, so in the saying of them: They want to spend them for the repentance The rhetoric of the reaction, except with the elders of the world, Egypt, Egypt, for the question of the rivalry of the rivalry, as a question to the exit of the world if the renovation of the cabinet, and that With consensus.As for our saying: The eligibility of the intercession is to be exaggerated from the world, which was due to the reward, the question of the rivalry was good, and the difference appeared.And the eighth: that his saying is up to the Almighty: The jaws are in a hell that they pray on the Day of Religion and what they are from their maps [breakfast: 14] indicates that all the lavis are not On the authority of it, and if it is proven that they are not absent from it, it is proven that they do not come out of it, and if it is like that, the reaction has no effect, neither in pardoning the punishment nor in the lava from the feat And the ninth: His Excellency said: The matter arranges the matter of expression, except after his permission [Yunus: 3] in the intercession, who did not give permission in his intercession, and that is what he said: Except with his permission [Al -Baqarah: 255], and his saying is the Almighty: They only speak to those who authorized him the Most Merciful.It was not permissible in the rush in the right of the people of the cabin; Because this permission, if he is known, is either by the mind or by transmission, but the mind has no field for him in it, and the transmission is, but it is not.In it; Because the narration of the ones is only the oppression, the question is scientific and the adherence to the scientific requests with the misconceptions that are not permissible.As for frequency, it is false; Because if he had obtained that of the Muslims, the Muslims were brought up, and if it was like that, they would not have denied this (P-55) the rush, so that the most is the best of us This ear was not found.And its adore: His Excellency said: Those who carry the throne and those around him praise the praise of their Lord and believe in it and seek forgiveness for those who are forgiven Something is mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow your path [Ghaffir: 7] and if you were the weapon, he would have met the success meaning.The one twenty: the news indicated that the rush is not found in the right of the companions of Al -Kabbir, which is four: The first: What was narrated And peace entered the grave and said: “Peace be upon you, a house of believers, and if God wills you after you, I have been appointed, and I have been given that I have seen our brothers: O God, do you have?He said: Rather, you are my companions and our brothers who did not come after.They said: O Messenger of God, how do you know who comes after your nation?He said: I saw that if a man had an horse that is a deceitful horse in a horse, then does he not know his horses?They said: Yes, O Messenger of God.The lost, I call them: not, do you not know, and it is said: They have changed after you, so I say: He was crushed and crushed.And the reciprocate of this news on the negation of the intercession is that if he was a lip of them, he would not have said: He was crushed and crushed; Because the lips do not say that, and how it is permissible for it to be an enclosure for them in salvation from the permanent punishment and it prevents them from drinking water.Al -Thani: Abd al -Rahman Ibn Sabat narrated on the authority of Jabir ibn Abdullah, “The Prophet ﷺ said to Kaab ibn Ajara:“ O Kaab ibn Ajar He will be the princes of those who entered them, so he helped them on their injustice and believe them with their lies And they did not curse them on their injustice, and they did not believe them with their lies, so he is from me and I am from him and I will return to me, O Kaab bin Bin Ajra Al -Sawam, and al -Sawam and al -Sawdah al -Qarban and al -Sawdah and al -Sawdah and al -Sawdah and al -Qarbah and al -Qarbah and al -Qarban Sin, as the water is extinguished, oh Kaab Bin Ajra does not enter Paradise Foolishness, you have wiped out." And the recipient of this hadith is from three directions: one of them: that if it is not from the Prophet or the Prophet from it, then how does he intercede for him.And the second: Its saying: “It is not mentioned to the excess.Because if it is forbidden from the prayer to the Messenger, until he does not want the obligatory, then the Messenger is obeyed from his salvation from the first punishment.(And the third of it): His saying: “He does not enter heaven for flesh that has proposed from the shed.” The third: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, peace and blessings be upon him said: From God, something that has reached you.This is a wound to the one who is required; Because if he does not have anything from God, he will not have a share in the rush.Al -Rabaa: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: The prayers and peace be upon him said: So he eaten his thues, and a man who hired a reward, so he would not be fulfilled from him and did not fulfill his reward.And the one who is in the authority of him is that he is peace and peace be upon him, when he was pure for the liability of it that is impossible to be an intercessor for them, so this is the group of the face of this door.As for our companions, they have been held in it with its faces: (p-56) One of them: His Glory be to him and the Almighty: a story on the authority of Jesus, peace be upon him: if you are tormented, then they will be tortured, then they will be tortured, then they will be forgiven You are the dear, the wise [Al -Maaidah: 118] and the face of the recipient is that this rushing is from Jesus, peace be upon him, either it is said: It was in the right of the infidels or the right of the unbeliever in Or in the right of a young Muslim or a Muslim who has the great one after the repentance or the Muslim who is the great of the major before the repentance, and the first section of the first; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: If you forgive them, you are the dear, the wise [Al -Ma’idah: 118], does not fit the disbelievers, and the second, third and faster division is false; Because the obedient Muslim and the Muslim is the owner of the small and the Muslim who is the great owner His saying: If you torture them, then they are your worshipers [Al -Ma’idah: 118] and he is full of them, and if it is prolonged, it is not remaining until it is said: This is the reaction, but it is returned in the right of the right Before the repentance, and if the saying is valid with this rivalry in the right of Jesus, peace be upon him, the saying of it is valid in the right of Muhammad ﷺ the harm that he does not say.And the second: His words are a story about Abraham, peace be upon him: Whoever follows me, then he is from me and whoever is my stick, for you are forgiven, merciful [Ibrahim: 36] Rahim [Ibrahim: 36] His pregnancy is not permissible for the infidel; Because it is not a family For forgiveness for consensus, and he does not hold him to the young owner, nor on the great owner after the repentance; Because his forgiveness has a reason for a mind with the characteristic, so he does not need him to the intercession, so he only holds his pregnancy on the owner of the oldest before the repentance, The two verses are what we said what Al -Bayhaqi narrated in the book of the people of faith, “It is upon him prayer and peace be upon him.Peace be upon him: If you torment them, then they are your worshipers [Al -Maaidah: 118] The verse, then he raised his hands and said: “O God, my nation is my nation, and he cried, and God said: Oh God: And your Lord knows - so make him cry?Jabriel brought him, and he asked him, and the Messenger of God told him ﷺ What he said, so God Almighty said: O Jabriel, go to Muhammad, so say to him: It was narrated by a Muslim in Al -Saheeh.And the third of it: His exalted say in Surah Mary: The day we are governed by the righteous to the Most Merciful and the Reddown and the Cross of the Grands of the Hell and the one who does not give it When the Rahman is a covenant [Maryam: 85], so we say that it is not in the appearance of the verse that what is meant by the verse is that the criminals do not possess the reaction to others, or they are not.They are not for them; Because the source is as it is permissible and its addition is improved to the actor, it is permissible and its addition is improved to the act.Because her holding it on the first face is running the course of clarification of the clarifications, then every one knows that the criminals who are taken to hell and a country that does not For them, so she can hold her pregnancy on the second direction.If this is proven, then it is said: The verse indicates the incidence of the people of the people of Al -Kabbar; Because he said: Except for those who have taken the mercy of a covenant [Maryam: 85], and the appreciation is that the criminals do not deserve that they will be brought to them, but they will be brought to them, but they will be brought to them, but they will be brought to them.The Most Merciful is a covenant, for everyone who took the mercy of the mercy in it, and it is necessary to enter it, and the owner of the great is taken from the mercy and the mercy of the It will be inside the maximum of the chapter to be said: The Judaization is taken with the Most Merciful as a covenant, which is faith in God, so his entry is required for him For the freedom of consensus, it is obligatory to be done by it, while it is behind it.And its elevation: His Excellency said in the attribute of the angels: they only interfere with those who are satisfied [Al-Anbiya: 28] It was a succession to God, and it must be among the people of the reaction, but we said: The great owner of the greatness is that God is exalted, because he is the one who is satisfied with God.And its uniform, And everyone who believed that he is satisfied with God, according to this description, believes that he is satisfied with God Almighty; Because the one who is satisfied with God is a part of our concept of our saying: He went on to God according to his faith, and when the compound is true, the ritual of the paradise is the one It is satisfied with God, and if this is proven, it must be among the people of the intercession; To say to the Almighty: They do not interfere except for those who are satisfied [the Prophets: 28] The negation of the rush is only for those who were satisfied, and the discretion from the negation is a proof, so it is necessary to be For their reaction, and if it is proven that the great owner is inside the reaction of the angels, it must be entered into the rushing of the prophets and the repetition of Muhammad, the harm that he does not say.If it was said: The words are on this reciprocate from two sides: The first: that the evildoer is not in a way The angels must not be a family of Muhammad's reactions ﷺ, but we said: It is not necessary because it is not with the right of it, according to it.It is not in the sense of his immorality, it is true that it is not in the eyes The angels; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: they only intercede for those who are satisfied with the negation of the rushing from everyone except in the right of the one who is satisfied.Nafi.الوَجْهُ الثّانِي: أنَّ الِاسْتِدْلالَ بِالآيَةِ إنَّما يَتِمُّ لَوْ كانَ قَوْلُهُ: ولا يَشْفَعُونَ إلّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضى مَحْمُولًا عَلى أنَّ المُرادَ مِنهُ ولا يَشْفَعُونَ إلّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضاهُ اللَّهُ, As for if we carried it that what is meant is from it and does not intercede except for those who are satisfied with God, his reaction is, then the verse does not indicate that the verse does not indicate, unless it is proven that God is the Almighty.The first question.The answer to the first: that it has been established in the science that the two important peoples do not contradict, so we said: a more Zurer is no more than a world that is not a world that does not have a person who does not Zourt is a scholar with jurisprudence, a more important thing with a scholar, and if you prove this, then our saying: It is said: It is necessary for his debt, not with the basis of his immorality, and also when when you have proven that it is necessary for his Islam, then he is the same as the peace of his peace.Al -Muttahni was the extension of his universe, and he was exhausted as his universe, which has been obtained by his being, as he is in the sense of his faith, and his faith must enter.And his exit from the exaltation of it, and when it was, it was proven that it is from the people of the intercession.As for the second question: his answer is to hold the verse on the one that it is with its curses and they only interfere with whom God has brought him the first of his pregnancy that what is meant and does not interfere except for those who are satisfied with his ritual.Because the first estimation benefits the verse of desire and the urbanization of the request of the pleasure of God, the glory of God Almighty, and the attainment of his transgression, and on the estimation of the second, the second is not the one who does not.The interpretation of the words of God is the highest of what was more extensive.Fifth: His Excellency said in the adjective of the infidels: So what is the benefit of the Shafi’is [Al -Muddathir: 48] He specialized them with that, so it is obligatory to be the state of the Muslim with a disagreement Disclosure of the speech.And its sixth: His Exalted be to Muhammad: And ask forgiveness for your guilt and the believers and the believers (p-58) [Muhammad: 19] لِكُلِّ المُؤْمِنِينَ والمُؤْمِناتِ وقَدْ بَيَّنّا في تَفْسِيرِ قَوْلِهِ تَعالى: الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالغَيْبِ [البقرة: 3] أنَّ صاحِبَ الكَبِيرَةِ مُؤْمِنٌ, وإذا كانَ كَذَلِكَ ثَبَتَ أنَّ مُحَمَّدًا ﷺ He expressed forgiveness for them, and if it was, it is proven that God Almighty has forgiven them.He is up to God Almighty and not with Muhammad ﷺ, and he referred to God Almighty when he commanded Muhammad to seek forgiveness for all the sticks, so he did not have his supplication, and he is not for you The reaction is only this.And the one who followed it: His Excellency said: And if you live with a greeting, they will live with the best of it or its response [Women: 86], then God Almighty commands that they will be one of them, if they live with them, if they live.With the best of it or its response, then he commanded us to greet Muhammad ﷺ when he said: O you who believe, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him This is a greeting, and when we asked God for the mercy of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, he was obligated to say his saying: They revived the best of it or the one who did it.مِثْلَهُ وهو أنْ يَطْلُبَ لِكُلِّ المُسْلِمِينَ الرَّحْمَةَ مِنَ اللَّهِ تَعالى, وهَذا هو مَعْنى الشَّفاعَةِ, ثُمَّ تَوافَقْنا عَلى أنَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الصَّلاةُ والسَّلامُ غَيْرُ مَرْدُودِ الدُّعاءِ, فَوَجَبَ أنْ God accepts his ruggedness in all, and he is the one who is required.And the eighth: His Exalted said: And if they had wronged themselves, they came to you, so they forgive God and forgive them for the Messenger, and they found God, and God is good.[64] The repentance, and the verse indicates that the Messenger when he asks for forgiveness for the disobedience and the oppressors.An acceptance in the world, so it must be an acceptance in the hereafter; Because he does not say the difference.And the ninth: We are all over the rush of Muhammad ﷺ and its influence is either that it is in the increase in the benefits or in the overthrow of the harms, and the first is false, or only You shake the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, if we ask God to increase in his virtue when we say: O God, pray to Muhammad and on the family of Muhammad The second one is the one who is required, if it is said: We are not called us as we are philanthropists to Muhammad ﷺ to Jahin: The first: that the lips are not the same The core for him, and we are, even if we are asking the good to him, peace and blessings be upon him, but when we were the lowest arrangement from him, peace and blessings be upon him, and he did not.Shafi’a.The second: Abu al -Husayn said: The question of the benefits is for others, but it is an intercession if the action of those benefits is for the sake of his question, and if it was not, it was not done or not.Doing her, but if she did whether he asked her or did not ask her, and the abuse of the liquid is close to that to the questioner, and if the question is not fulfilled by the question In addition, then this is not a reaction to him, not to see that if the authority is determined to complicate his son and a lion, then he urged him to do so, and he is not a guardian of that It is a case, whether it was urged by it or did not urge it, and he intended that approach to the authority to get him with that of a house with him, so he does not say: He does not say: This is our condition in the right of the Messenger ﷺ when we ask him from God Almighty, and it was not correct that we would be a companion.The answer to the first, we do not surrender that the arrangement is considered in the rush.The evidence is that the lips were called an intercession from the height, and this meaning is not considered in which the arrangement is not considered, so their saying falls, and this is the question, and this is the question of the question, and this is the question of the question The second, (P-59) and also, then say in the answer to the second question: If we are cut off by that God Almighty honors His Messenger and maximizes his mother, whether the mother of the mother is the mother You ask, but we do not cut it that it is not permissible to increase in his honor by asking the nation that is on the face of the face, without the question of the nation, then it was not the same, then this is the time.It is permissible, and the permissibility of our eyes should be seen.And its adore: His Excellency said in the attribute of the angels: Those who carry the throne and those around him praise the praise of their Lord And the owner of the largest of the sentences of the believers, so it is obligatory to enter it in the sentence of those who seek forgiveness for the angels for them, the most in the door is that he returned after that, then he said: Repent and follow your path [Ghafir: 7], except that this does not require that this year be specialized because of what you have proven in the origins of jurisprudence that the general memorization if it is mentioned after it is then that it is not.This year is required to be specialized with that special.Haddi: Ten: The news indicated Interest for the people of the cabarets, and let us remember three of them: The first: His saying is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him: The symptoms have three faces: one of them: it is one news and he responded to the anti -Quran, so we have indicated that many of the verses indicate the negation On the contradiction of the Qur’an, it must be reserved.And the second: It indicates that his reaction is only for the people of the cabinets, and this is not permissible; Because his reaction is a great position, so it is characterized by the people of the cabinets, just as it requires the sanctity of the people of the reward for it, and that is not permissible; Because there is no less than the level.And the third of it: that this question is not from the practical questions, so it is not permissible to suffer in it by thinking and telling the one who is not beneficial except for the suspicion, so it is not permissible for you to do so.With this news.Then, if we greeted us with the authenticity of the news, there is no arguments: one of them: that what is meant by it is the one who understands in the sense of denying it means: my rituals of the people His saying: This is my Lord [Al -Anam: 77], meaning this is my Lord.And the second: that the great memorization is not unique, not in the origin of the language, nor in the knowledge of the law by disobedience, but rather as the disobedience will be taken over.The Almighty said in the description of the prayer: It is a great person except for the humbled, and if it is like that, then say it to the people of the captain What is meant by the people of great obedience.If it was said: He endowed that the pride of obedience and sins will be given, but his saying the people of Al -Kabbir are the form of a collection of compositions with a thousand, and the blame is the one who is the same The news indicates the confirmation of the intercession, for everyone who was among the people of Al -Kabbir, whether it was from the people of the great obedience or the great ticks, we said: The memorial of the brightness is not for the sake “People” is unique, so it does not benefit the general, so it is sufficient in the sincerity of the news, one person from the people of the cabin The hadith was carried on it.And the third of it: He gave it that it is obligatory to carry the people of Al -Kabbir on the people of the great sins, but the people of the great sins are the best of the people of the great tin, after the ritual or the ritual, So we carry the news of the people of the great ticks after the repentance, and the effect of the intercession will be that God is preferred by God, upon him On his immorality, peace be upon us, the significance of the news of your saying, but he is opposed to what was narrated from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: (P-60) With the thunderbolt of understanding on the path of denial.Al -Hassan narrated from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: My reaction is only for the people of the cabinets of my nation.He knew that fairness is that it is not possible to hold in the same way as this issue with this news alone, but in the group of the news that is in the chapter of the ritual, the ritual of the ritual The descent of all these interpretations.The second: Abu Hurairah narrated that he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “For every prophet who is an admired call, and every prophet has accelerated his call, and I will be disturbed, and I have been disturbed.The resurrection is a wandering, if God wills whoever dies from my nation does not share anything with God, “narrated by a Muslim in the authentic His nation does not share anything with God and the great owner of the great, so he must receive the rush.And the third: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: Do you know why?They said: No, O Messenger of God, he said: God collects the first and the others in a single sincere, and the preacher will hear them, and their insight will be implemented, and the sun is not.They do not rest, and some people say for some: Do you not see what you are in?Do you not see what you have reached, do you not go to those who intercede for you to your Lord?Then some people say to each other: Your father is Adam, so they will come to Adam, and they say: O Adam, you are the father of the human being So prostrate to you, intercede for us to your Lord, do you not see what we are in which you do not see what we have reached?And he says to them: My Lord has angered today, he did not angry like him before him, and he will not be angry after him, and he is the one who is from him They went to others, and they went to Noah.So they come to Noah, and they say: O Noah, you are the first messengers to the people of the earth, and your heavens, God, a servant, thank you, and the intercession of us to your Lord, do not you see what we are in?And he says to them: My Lord has angered today, he did not get angry before him, and he will not be angry after him, and he was not like him.They went to others, and they went to Abraham.And they will come to His Excellency, peace be upon him, and they say: You are the honor of the Prophet of God and His Khalil from the people of the earth, and he intercede for us to your Lord, not to see what we are in?And he says to them, Ibrahim: My Lord has angered today, anger, and he did not get angry before him, and he will not be angry after him.They went to others, they went to Moses, and they will come to Moses and say: O Moses, you are the Messenger of God, so God preferred you with his peace and his words to the people, to the people of the people We are in it?Moses says to them: My Lord has angered today, he was angry, and he did not get angry before him.He is angry after him, and I killed a soul that I did not kill her, my soul is my soul They say: You are the Messenger of God and I spoke to him to Mary and a spirit from him and you spoke to the people in the Mahda, intercede for us to your Lord, do you not see what we are in?And Jesus says to them: My Lord has angered today, he did not angry before him, like him, and he will not be angry after him, and he did not remember him, and he did not remember him They went to others, and they went to Muhammad.So they come to me, and they say: O Muhammad, you are the Messenger of God and the Ronot of the Prophets, and God has forgiven you for what you have provided from your sin and what you are delayed, do you not be?So I go and give permission to my Lord, and he will give me permission for me.And give it to you and the intercession, you will be interceded, so I will be my Lord with the praise of it I signed a prostration to him, so he called me what God wants to pray for me, then he says: Raise your head and say, hear and ask you to give it and the intercession of it.I intercede, so I am a limit, and he entered them, and then I return, so if I saw my Lord, I will fall for him, and he will pray for me, so that God wills me, then pray for me, then say: Your head, say, hear, and give it to you, and the intercession, so you will be broken.Then I return and say: O Lord, what remained in the fire is only those who the Qur’an holds, that is, the immortality must be upon him.The disgraced said: The words are on this news and its proverbs are from his face Rather, it was narrated by itself, and on this estimation, it is nothing of it.And secondly: It is a one that is a single satellite, and that it was narrated on different faces with the advents and the sacredness, and that is also what the accusation is raised to it.And the third of it: It is an immersion of similarity, and that is also false, which is the accusation to it.And its booster: that it was returned to the disagreement of the Qur’an.This is also the accusation of it.Fifth: It is a news about a great occurrence that provides the reasons for its transfer, so if it was correct, it would have been obligatory to the limit The accusation was shed.And its sixth: that the anticipation of the news of the one who is not only the thinking in the categorical questions is not permissible.Our companions answered this obedience that each one of this news, even if it is narrated by the ones, only It is a lot of great and among it is one of the one and one of the people of the punishment of the fire in the cause And God knows.The answer to all the evidence of the dismissed one is a single letter, which is that they showed them on the negation of the intercession that benefits the negation of all of the intercession, and showed us the effect of the reaction Especially, and the year and the private, if the special introduction over the year, then our evidence was presented to their evidence, then we allocate each one of the face The first direction: It is the adherence to the words of the Almighty: It is not accepted from it, so it is granted that the lesson is the general perfect, not with the privileges of the cause, except that this is the same The special is sufficient for the lowest indicative, so if the evidence indicates the existence of the reaction, the destiny is required to specialize.As for the second face: It is the saying of the Almighty: What the shadows of those who are fools and no lips are obeyed [Ghafir: 18] The answer to him is that his saying: What the shadows of the people of Hammam or no For our saying: For those who are gathered, protective and luxurious, but our saying: For the oppressors, the assembly and analogy are completely required, and we are the subject of the total, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative, the negative.And the robe is sufficient in its honesty, the fulfillment of that robe in some of the pictures, and does not need it to achieve that robe in all the pictures, and on this, then we will say.With it; Because there is no time for the oppressors, and no lips are obligatory, and they are the disbelievers, but it is judged for each one of them with the negative of the gums.As for the third face: and it is his saying: before he comes a day, there is no sales in it, no disorder, or an intercession [Al -Baqarah: 254].As for the faster face: and it is his saying: and what the persons are supporters of the supporters [Al -Baqarah: 270], the answer to it is that it is the opposite of our saying: for those who are supporters, and this is a whole, and this is a whole, and this is a whole.His saying: And what the perseverances of negative supporters are partial, so that its significance will be the negative of the general public and the negative of the general does not benefit the generality of the robe.(P-62).His saying: So what is the benefit of the two philosophers [Al -Muddathir: 48] This is a response in the right of the infidels, and it indicates the reason for specialization against this judgment in the right of the believers.As for the sixth face: it is his saying: they only intercede for those who are satisfied [the Prophets: 28], the saying was presented in it.As for the seven face: It is the saying of the Muslims: O God, make us among the people of the Muhammad of Muhammad, so the answer is that we have the effect of the ritual in the authority of the ritual The unrelated destiny between the flow of the beneficial benefits on the destiny of the investigator, and the payment of the harmonious harms of the sins, and that destiny is not destroy The servant is disobedient, so the question was pushed.As for The eighth direction: It is the one who is consumed by its saying: The jaws are in hell [Al -Anfitah: 14] So the words are upon him will come if God Almighty wills in the question of Al -Waad.As for the ninth face: it is his saying that there is no evidence of God, glory and exalted in the intercession of the companions of the cabinets, so his answer is that this is a variety of, and it is a variety of people, The indicative indications of this reaction.As for the tenth face: and it is his saying in the right of angels: forgive those who repent [Ghafir: 7], his answer is what indicated that the last of this is not in this verse.As for the hadiths, it is indicated that Muhammad does not intercede for some people and does not intercede in some of the citizenships الكَبائِرِ, ولا أنَّهُ يُمْتَنَعُ مِنَ الشَّفاعَةِ في جَمِيعِ المَواطِنِ.And whom we achieve is that it is clear that one of the beneficiaries is not interceded except with the permission of God, so perhaps the Messenger was not a woman who is permissible in some of the places It is interceded in that place or in that time, and then he becomes permissible in another position and at another time in the intercession, so he will intercede there, and God knows.The philosophy said in the interpretation of the intercession: If the existence is required in the year of the pharmacy, there is complete quality, where it does not get it, but it does not get the same as the fact that it is not possible.The thing is prepared for the acceptance of the predecessor from the obligation of the existence, except that it is prepared to the acceptance of that prevailing before it is before it and the obligation of the existence, so that it is the existence, so that it is the existence of the Like the intermediary between the duty of existence and between that the first thing, and its example in the sensual is that the sun is only illuminated by the component component, and it is not the right to the house, and the house is not.For the generosity of the sun, there is no crime, in which there is no more than the acceptance of the light from the sun, except that if a bored of the pure water is placed and the water is shed That light is reflected from that water to the water, so that clear water is in the middle of the light from the sun of the sun to the sink, which is the one who is not the same.The prophets are like the ribs between the obligatory and the existence of existence and among the souls of the creation in the domain of the flood and the obligation of the existence to the people of the public, so this is what they said in the intercession.
