The Quranic researcher (P-46) (Surah Al-Malik) is thirty verse in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Menjah; Because it is saved its reader from the torment of the grave, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he was calling it the argument; Because she is arguing about her reader in the grave, and she is thirty angels.﷽ Your king, who is in his hand, is for all of it, as well This is the memorial, but it is used to confirm, as it is an king and an angel, as it is said: with the hand of the matter, the end, the solution, the contract, and the entry of the ritual.The owner of the “scout” said: The king is in his hands on every fence, and it is all that is not capable of the capabilities, and it is said: It is on everything that is capable of: The first: This verse invokes that those who claimed that the enemy is something.The ritual of God is exalted, either to be a prostitute or an enemy, it is not permissible to be a supply, because if he was able to do the existence, it is that he was not.Reasonable; Because finding the suppliers is referred, either to be able to execute it while it is referred to, because the imprisonment of the execution of the subject, and that is because the ability is a description that is not influenced Impact, and the number is a pure negation, so it will be transmitted to make the numbers the effect of the ability, so the impact of the execution will be reflected, so it is proven that the thing is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is With a fence, it is obligatory to be an enemy, so that this is a thing, and our companions have been exhausted to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said that He doubted that the jewel is from where it is a thing, and the blackness is where it is a blackness, and God is ahead of everything.So that this verse requires that it be able to be able to go away from where it is a jewel, and on the blackness from where it is black, and if (P-47) is like that, then it was the same.Black is black and falling into the verb, and the deceased actor must be advanced to his action, so if God and himself are provided with the place of the place Bedouin, then it is necessary for the one to be nothing, and it is the one who is required, then they answered the suspicions of the character It is permissible to say: For the sake of it, it will make anything?This is, even if it is metaphor, but it is required to destiny to it; To do the path of evidence that is indicated that the mantle is not something.The second question: The judge was claimed by Abu Bakr in one of his saying that an execution The bodies are located in the act, and this is the choice of Abu Al -Hassan Al -Khayeh from the dismissed, and the Hammud al -Khuraizi, and the grace of the public from us and from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a disgrace The judge was invoked by the fact that the struggles are things, and God is destined to be destined, so it is valid for the struggles, either that it is able to find it while it is referred; Because finding the supplies is referred, or on its execution, and that requires that the execution of the effect is possible.The third question: Al -Kaabi claimed that he is the highest, unique to the same as the servant of the servant, and the claim of Abu Ali and Abu Hashem is that he is the highest, and he said: Our companions: It is an exalted person who is able to do the same as the slave of the servant and other than his destiny, and they needed that he had the opposite of the servant and the same Something estimated, so you have proven the validity of one of the two capabilities.The following question: our companions claimed that there is no influence except the ability of God Almighty, and they have said the saying of the kindness on what the philosopher says, and the words of the saying, What the disgrace says, and the saying that the servant is found for the same act Something from the possibilities was not in the capacity of God, but rather something other, for that other had prevented the destiny of God from the influence, while it was for the sake of it.Because what is only God is possible, then it is the most powerful power of God, and the weak cannot be pushed.The fifth question: This verse is indicative of the fact that God is one of the highest; Because if we have destroyed us a second divine, either he is able to find something or not be able, then he was not able to find something that was not in the first place, and he was not the same That is the second God, so it is necessary to be able to the first God; For his saying: He is on all things, and it is necessary for a fabrication between creators and he is referred; Because if it is one of them, it is resigned by finding, it is necessary for me to seek me with each one of them from each one of them, so it is needed for them, and it is a richness.The sixth question: He was brought up with this verse on the fact that he is not with something, and he said: If it was something, he would be able to do his soul, and he said: But his being is able to himself is referred, so he can see something as something, and our companions said: When he said: Say anything that is more than a martyr of God: 19).It is a thing that must be specialized in this general, so if this verse has been indicated that the special year is the special and is returned in the book of God Almighty, and it indicated that the year is not It is permissible, but it is signed.The following question: The gratitude of the disgraceful claim that God Almighty is able to create the falsehood, ignorance, messing around and darkness, (P-48) and the system was claimed that it is unjust, and it is unjust, And the lies are things, and God is destined to be able to be able to be able to.The eighth question: the people of the truce begged that it is the highness of the bias and the face, for it is the Almighty if he has obtained in a way without a matter It is distinguished in it a distinction from the bias, which was judged that it is not in it; If no one is distinguished from the other from the other, it would be impossible to judge that he was upset in it, and he did not get the other, then if one of the people is in the past Koin a matter of time; Because the pure numbers are obeyed to be referring to the sense, and that some of it be distinguished from some in the sense, and that it is a intention to be a meant Humanity has been in a matter of time, and that is a matter of struggle, and if that preference was a resurrection, it would be something and it was an estimated to God; His exalted say: It is all powerful and if it is achieved that is the way of the ability of God and its creation, then it is necessary for God to be in the way That is the matter, and when it was like that, God was present in the eternal, achieved from other times and has an atheist at all, and the eternal does not go away, and it is the same, so it is the same.I eternally and ever.The ninth question: that he said first: The king is in him and then he said after him: He is on everything capable, and this is a feeling that he is that he is the one who is the same Everything is capable, and this is what our companions say that he had fallen into the worshiper of the servant and does not fall into the intention of God, if that was a feeling of miracle, and the weakening, and the weakening, and the weakening, and the weakening, and the weakening, Launching, and that indicated that when the king of the king was, it is necessary to be able to all things.The question: the fate is exaggerated in the Qadir, so when it was destined to all the things, it is not necessary for him to prevent him from the mortal of what is forbidden to find anything from the abundance of it There is nothing on him, otherwise it is that the merit of it is from the blessing and that nothing from it is not sacrificed, otherwise it is that the ugliness of it is forbidden, so there is no fullness in the verb, so there is no fullness in the verb.It is not able, and God knows.
