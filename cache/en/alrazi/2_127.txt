The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: And when Abraham raises Al -Qudaad from the house and the hearing of our Lord, you accept from us that you are the hearing of our Lord, and make us of our Lord, and those who are Muslim.A Muslim for you and show us your suffering and show us that you are the Most Merciful, our Lord, and send a messenger from them that you will recite your verses and teach them and teach them and teach them and teach them and teach them and teach them You are the dear, wise Supplication, then here are the questions: the first question: its saying: And when the story raises a state of past, and the barriers are the collection of a base, which is the basis, and the origin is what is on the authority of it, The constant, and from it, may God protect you, that is, I ask God to take you, that is, it will be proven and raised the constructive basis on it, because if it is built on it, we will be transmitted from this It was lengthened after the confusion, and it is permissible for those who want to be built by building because every savage is bound for those who are built on it and the bottom of it is placed, and the meaning By building because if he put a sophisticated, then a shed, then he raised the sins, and God knows.The second question: the most of the people of the news, on the fact that this house was supplied before Ibrahim, peace be upon him.Ibrahim Al -Qudaad from the house, for this is clear that those signs were bound by a threat, except that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, raised it and built it.The third question: They disagreed that he was the hearing of peace be upon him, a partner of the Abraham, peace be upon him, in raising the barriers of the house and his construction?The majority said: He was a partner for him in that and appreciation, and when Abraham raises and listens to the barriers from the house and the evidence is upon him that he is the highest That kindness will be in the verb of the actions that the predecessor of its remembrance, and only the remembrance of the lifting of the barriers of the house was presented, so it is obligatory to be a loudness That is, then their partnership in that bears and faces: one of them: to be bought in construction and raising the two grandfathers.And the second: that one of them is a sofa for the house and the other is raised to the stone and the wine, and it is prepared for him machines and tools, and on the two guys, they will be added to the guarantee, and the guarantee is to add to the guarantee.The first was included in the truth, and from the people who said: The hearing in that time was a small roll and it was narrated with it on the authority of God, and God is pleased with him.Hear and migrated, and he said: To whom do you eat?Abraham said: To God, he thirsts for his hearings, and he did not see anything of water, so they called them Gabriel on him Peace and examining the earth with its sake, so the Zamzam and these were made, made the stand on its saying: From the house, then they started: The house is on this estimation, it will be the hearing of a partner (P-53) in the supplication, not in construction, and this interpretation is weak because it was said: it is not accepted from us, it is not for us.He accepts, so he must be shrouded to the precedent mentioned, and he raised the house.The disagreement of the phenomenon of the Qur’an, so his response is required, and God knows.The following question: Rather, he said: And when Abraham lifted Al -Quda’a from the house and did not say: The obstacles of the house will be raised, because in the dignity of the signs and the people of the time The one is not in the last phrase, and know that God Almighty told them after that three types of supplication.The first type: in his words, the Exalted: You accept from us that you are the most knowledgeable and in which there are questions: The one who speaks: every act that God accepts, and he will repent his friend and satisfy him from him, and who is not attached to him and does not satisfy him from him, so he is the one The two who are in the name of the other, so he remembered the acceptance of the acceptance and wanted the reward and contentment that the acceptance is that the man accepts what is guided by him, and he is the same, so he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same And the satisfaction of God is the Almighty to expand.Al -Arafoun said: A separation between acceptance and acceptance, for the acceptance is a burden on the fact that the human being in his acceptance, and that is where it is where the work is not.This is a conversation with them by defaulting in work, and a confession of miracles and fractures, and also, so it was not intended to give the reward to it, because the fact that it is not the case.The acceptance is the most delicious of the sane servant from giving the reward to him and the perpetrator of his investigation, he will come to the interpretation of love in the saying God [Al -Baqara: 165], and God knows.The second question: After they came to the servants, they were glorified, they were raised to God Almighty in its acceptance, and they asked for the reward for what he said.The reward for the verb, the associate and the obligatory of God, the exalted, for what was in this supplication and the loss is extensive, for it is running that the human being will be lost to God The fire is hot and the dark is cold.His survival on his images in the mortality and the whiteness hot and it is improved at The one who is not arranged for the same as this action, so the supplication must be more ugly.Something originally, and God knows.The second question: but this supplication is followed by his saying: You are the most knowledgeable as if he says: Our supplication is heard and we will be lost, and we know what is in our heart Flatness to one of you.If it was said: Its saying: You are the hearing, the knowledge, it will benefit the exclusivity, and the matter is like that.We said: It is a groan to his fullness in this adjective, as if he is the one who is devoted to it without otherwise.The second type: the supplication is his saying: Our Lord, and we have been given Muslims, in which there are questions: the first question: our companions have been in the question of the creation of the creation Muslims for you, for Islam is either that the one who is intended from religion and the belief is, or the Islam and the purity, and how it was a desire to make it to make it.With this adjective, there is no meaning except that creation in them, for making it a phrase for creation, God (P-54) said: He made the darkness and the light: [1] A creature of God Almighty, if it was said: This verse is a phenomenon of the phenomenon, because it requires that they are the time of the question that they are not Muslims, for if they were not Muslims, if they were not Muslims They make them Muslims as a request to obtain the arrival and that it is false, but the Muslims gathered all that they were in that time, Muslims, and that there is no Muslim, and that there is no religion It only reconciles after they were Muslims, and if it is proven that the verse is the phenomenon of the dahd Make a expressions of creation and creation, but rather has other canes except creation.One of it: He made a sense of meaning.And the second: He made in the sense of endowment, we say: I made you this sacrifice and this servant and this horse.And the third of it: He made the sense of the description of the thing and the ruling on it, as the Almighty saying: And they made the angels who are the servants of the Most Merciful.[Anam: 100].And its elevation: He made it like that in the sense of the matter, as it is the Almighty saying: We made them imams [the Prophet: 73] means our command to take them with them, and he said: Fifth: to make him in the sense of learning as his saying: I made him a writer and poet if you teach him.And its sixth: the Bayan and the connotation say: I made the words of so and so if you want from the pilgrimage what shows the heroes of that, if you prove that, then say: Why does it not In Islam and the judgment of them with that, as it is said: I made me a thief and made me virtuously a writer if he described it with this What is meant by the creation of the ritual rolls to them to Islam and their success is for that, so whoever has the success of God for these things until he does it, then he has made it, and he has made it.He disciplined his son until he becomes a writer, so it is permissible to say: I made you a writer and made you a writer, and in the dispute of that it is said: He made his son for a grateful thief, peace be upon us It is an immortal exaggeration of Islam, but it is a difference of mental evidence, so it is obligatory to leave the saying with it, but we said: It is on the other hand.The action of the servant created for God Almighty when the servant deserves to be praised, not rewarded, no reward, or punishment, and God must be the Almighty, the Muslim is not the worshiper.And the answer: His saying: The verse is the one who is a phenomenon.Muslims have any of this, this is the presentation in the time that is always accepted, and he demanded that it be obtained in the future time that does not contradict its crops immediately.The second: That the one who is intended for it is the increase in Islam as his saying: to increase faith with their faith [Al -Fateh: 4], and those who guided them increased their guidance [Muhammad] But to reassure my heart [Al -Qarra: 260], as if they called him the increase in the leanness and belief, and the demand for the leadership does not contradict the origin of the original immediately.The third: that Islam, if it is released, will benefit faith and belief.He estimated and left the rulings in the rulings of God, and he spent it, and they were naked, Muslims, but perhaps he may remain in their heart The human being, so he wanted to remove God from them (P-55) in the kidneys, so that they may get the place of satisfaction with the elimination of the path of the king, so it is proven by the one who is the same The phenomenon.His saying: He is carried by the ruling on that, we said: This is a burden of face The one who is required by the supplication is the extermination of the description, and it must be carried on the sake of the adjective, and it is not said: His description is high with that praise and praise, and it is desirable in it, and it is in it.The same thing is more than the desire to obtain the description of it and judge it, so it was his pregnancy over the first.And the second: when Islam has obtained in them, then he deserved the name with that, and God is up to him, and the liar is permissible for him, so that description was Coordinated and any use in his request for the supplication.And the third of it: that if he was intended for the name, it is obligatory that everyone who called Abraham is a Muslim, it is permissible to say that he made him a Muslim, but he said: Al -Awfa, we said: This is also a burden of faces: one of them: that the ultimate is added to Islam, so he told him about it to the other.And the second: that those rolls have done it, may God bless her and find her and brought her to the existence of the time of the dismissed, so he asked her to be a request for a sake.And the third of it: that these kindness are either that it has a effect on the survival of the verb of the verb on the kinship or it is not, then it has no effect in this way, it is not so that it is not so.And if it has an effect in the hypothesis, then it is said: When will the righteous get, then the garment was obtained and that is because with that of that destiny from the hypocrisy, or it is a matter Or it is not obligatory and does not refrain from it, for if it is obligatory, it is the one who is required, and if it is forbidden, it is forbidden, not likely, and if it is not obligatory and does not refrain Its fall is the last, and the time of the time is made with the fall of the fog.Surprisingly, the gathering of kindness, with this increased guerrilla, so this kindness was not a effect in the premature origin, and we have imposed it, so if this is a successor, if this is a successor.The most prominent of the two cans are necessary for the other one who is likely to be referred, and it was proven that the saying of this kind is not reasonable.His saying: The mental evidence indicated the abuse of the verb of the servant with the creation of God Almighty, and it is the separation of praise and the slander, our saying is: His report came back and phases, and God knows.And know that the famous question in this verse is that when they were Muslims, how to seek Islam?We have entered it in this question and reminded us of sufficient healing and praise for God for that, then the one who indicates the mind of the mind is that He has his grace, and he will only be the same and the Almighty.If you are not righteous to leave it, then the ability is obligatory, so that the ability required is created, so they made them Muslims, and if it is good With the peace of it, it is the one who is intended, but it is the one that is left with the abandonment of the return of the thing on its numbers, the origin and the nomadic, the exile is clear There is an impact on it, and because it is a remaining number and the rest is not attached Women, the ability is not good except for suppliers, and as for the ability to surrender as a righteousness, it is valid for the feet and the numbers, so the scalpel is the one who is the one who is the one.The righteous is not specialized in the extent of the existence except for the supreme, and it is obligatory to end the weapons to the verb (P-56), God is the Almighty to be cursed, and from the sins, and from the authority of the God is the Almighty, and the verb is obligatory, and it has proven that his saying: Our Lord, and make us Muslims to you who is the one who corrects the two mental evidences.The second question: His saying: Our Lord, and we have made us Muslims to you, to benefit the exclusivity A Muslim for the rulers of God, the Almighty, his judgment, and his destiny, and that the rhetoric is not satisfied with anything other than it, and this is what is meant by the saying of Abraham, peace be upon him, in the peace of peace An enemy for me except the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Shua’ar: 77] Then we say: One of them: Our Lord, and make us Muslims for you, that is, to you, and we are not worshiped.And the second: Two standing by all the bouquets of Islam, which is the one who is his general.The third question: As for the servant, God does not address the exalted time of the supplication, except by saying: Our Lord will come to him, if God wills, may God bless you, and he said: I respond to you [Ghaffir: 60] in the supplication of the supplication.As for the saying of the Almighty: And from our offspring is a Muslim nation for you, the meaning is: and make our children and “from” to be overflowing, and he specialized in them because it is the highest of them.With his words, the Exalted: The covenant of the unjust does not obtain from the people who said: The Arabs wanted him because they are from their offspring, and a “nation” was said to be the nation of Muhammad.They have a messenger from them, and we are asking: There are those who are not unjust, so if some of his offspring are a Muslim nation, it became known for that verse, so what is good in his request for a long time?Answer: That significance was not a veil, and the lips of misunderstanding are fond.The second question: Why did their offspring have a supplication, is this not that this is the course of miserliness in supplication?And the answer: The offspring is the right to accompany and the reconciliation.Goodness, do not you see that those who advance from scholars and great people if they are on the payment of how they cause them to pay those behind them.The third question: The phenomenon is that God is exalted, even if this supplication was repaid, he would have said that response, so when he was not declared in response to our knowledge, he answered him, and he has answered him, The time of the grandparents of Muhammad ﷺ There were no one of the Arabs Muslim, and only the Arabs were from the offspring of Abraham and the hearing of peace.The answer: Al -Qafal said: It is not still in their offspring whoever worships God alone and does not share anything with him, and the messengers have not been from the offspring of the anomal Bin Amr ibn Nafil, and Qas ibn Sa`da, and Abd al -Mutlabi ibn Hashem said: By expressing and returning, reward and punishment, and they unit God Almighty, and they do not eat dead, and do not worship the two.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: And we see your suffering, and it is in it.We call (P-57) people to Hajj, so we taught his bodies and what we want to bring him in it from work and saying that this is from the vision of the knowledge of God, he said: Reduce the shadow [Al -Faraqan: 45], did you not see how your Lord did with the companions of the elephant [the elephant: 1].The second: I appear to help us until we see it.Al -Hasan said: Gabriel, peace be upon him, see the wickedness of all of you, until he reached norms, so he said: O Ibrahim, I know what I have seen from your insults?He said: Yes, I called the nations.With the seven storms, he did, so the Satan went, then he presented it to him in the second, third and four -year -old today, all of that commanded him, Jabril, peace be upon him.We are a third saying, which is that the intention is knowledge and vision together.It is the saying of the judge that the pilgrimage is only fulfilled by matters, some of which are known and not seen, and some of them do not complete abuse from it except with vision, so it is obligatory Weak, because it requires the bearing of the memorizer on the truth and the metaphor with it and that it is not permissible, so the one who said the one who said: The one who said: The positions and positions in which the pilgrimage is held as a whispering and the definitions, and the signs, and the like, and whoever says the first, he said: Your impure is the work of Hajj as a cow.The second question: The human being is the worship, it is said to the worshipers of your people, then the sacrifice was called a whip and the sacrifice is a human being, and the pilgrims are called.Peace be upon him said: “Take your suffering from me, so that I may not meet you after this year.” And the positions in which the pilgrimage is held, called: your forgetfulness is also, and it is said: the forgotten of the conquest of the cinema in the sense of the verb, and the fracture of the cinema in the sense of the meaning, as well as the meaning And the Maghreb, God Almighty said: For every nation, we have made you forget it.[Hajj: 67].By opening and breaking, and the appearance of the words indicates the verb, and so, peace be upon him, peace be upon him: With me the positions of your human being, if you know this, then say: If you carry the sufferings on the pilgrimage, then if we carried it on the verbs, then the righteousness is to define those of the people, and that is on the authority The encyclopedias to define the buns and from the interpreters of those who carried your suffering on the sacrifice of only, and it is a mistake, because the sacrifice is called a whip of the entry of it.Therefore, they do not name what is sacrificed to eat with that, for what is for the sake of the sacrifice of the sacrifice, and it is a work of the pilgrimage, and it is a place that is based Everyone is in it, even if the caring of the Messenger is what is due to the origin of this word of worship and approach to God Almighty, and it is obligatory for what he is satisfied with it, and it is in general.The Exalted, peace be upon him, and his saying: And we see your suffering, that is, our knowledge, how do we worship you, and where do we worship you and what we are close to you, so we will come to you The servant is his money.The third question: Ibn Katheer and Abu Omar read in some of the novels “Arna” with the population of the Arabs in all the Qur’an, and they agreed with the authority and the son of Amir in a person in a ritual, Those who were lost [were chapted: 29] and Abu Omar read in some of the phenomena accounts from him by breaking up the breaking of the hatred of all the Qur’an, and the rest of the Qur’an, and the rest of the Qur’an, and the rest, And the origin of our lords with the broken wink, the fracture of the hamsti was transferred to the Arabs, and the prodigy was deleted, which is the choice, because the most reader is upon him, and it is not the same It is not possible that the Arab housing is not to be kept in the word, and the significance goes on the ham Like their saying: Take and a luggage, and the (P-58) is to seek to seek lightness and the survival of the significance on the deletion of the gossip.* * * As for his saying: We have a question: the first question: whoever has the permissibility of sins on the forefathers of this verse he said: Because he is the one who is a good thing Sins, if not the sin would be presented, otherwise he would seek repentance as a request for the person who is the one The repentance is a repentance of the young, and a saying that he says: The listener has become atoned with the reward of its actor, and if it becomes atoning, then the repentance of it is a matter In its removal, the removal of the voter is referred.We are more difficult to reconcile for the one who has the elderly and for those who did not allow it, and it is from its face Poor; Because whoever depicts himself with the image of the supporter is determined The strawberry was the most close to leaving sins, so this is a kind of light, calling for the blessings of the ticks.And the second: that the servant, even if he strives to obey his Lord, is that he does not relinquish from negligence from some face that.And the third of it: It is up to him when he knew that he will be in peace that he is in his offspring who is an unjust one, and he did not ask that he would make some of his death He asked him to spend those who are the sinners for the repentance, and he said: And we have any of the sinners from our offspring, and the father who is accompanied by his son, and the father who is accompanied by his son So the father apologized for him, he said: I was chosen, disobedient, and I was bound, and he accepted my excuse and be his intention: my son is a sinner, and he accepted his virginity, because the son of the person It is itself, and who strengthens this interpretation of its face From the people, whoever follows me, it is from me and whoever is my disobedience, for you are forgiven, merciful [Abraham: 36, 35], so it is necessary that the meaning be: and whoever is my disobedience, then you will be fed up.He forgives him for his sins.The second: It was mentioned that in the readers of Abd Allah: and insult them to your suffering and give them.The third: He said a kindness on this: Our Lord and send a messenger from them.The lord: Over the words of the Almighty: We have created you and then photographed you [Al -Araf: 11] by making his creation to him as a creation for them when they were from him, so he did not His saying: And show us your suffering, that is, show us our offspring.* * * If the repentance would be created for the servant, it would have been asked of God, a referred and ignorant exalted, the disgrace said: This is a opposition, since God is the Almighty.Those who believed, repent to God, a righteous repentance [Al -Taraim: 8] and if it was a verb for God Almighty, then he was asking for the servant to be ignorant and ignorant, and if it is clear, and if it is proven that We have to fulfill and do the rolls or the acceptance of repentance from the servant.When God did not create a call for a repetition of the repentance of the garment Once.And the second: that the repentance of what was summed up by Sheikh Al-Ghazali, may God have mercy on him: a phrase from the group of three things that are a prayer: knowledge (p-59) It is the obligatory of knowledge and work third, and it is the case with the case.The harmful, and this hurt is the name of the denomination, then it is born from this denomination as a characteristic that is called a will, and it is related to the condition, the past, and the future, and the one who is attached to it.For the one who was a crying for him, and as for the righteousness, he is determined to leave that deed that is died for loved And the judiciary, if it is to be forced, then the knowledge is the first and it is the one who is absent from these good deeds and I mean this knowledge of faith and the righteousness, for faith is a phrase of belief And Al -Aqeen is a phrase for the confirmation of this belief and the suspicion of it and its wake of the heart, then this jungle is what is on the authority of the heart of the heart of the heart The heart is where the light of the light of faith is seen, that it has become an argument from his loved ones, as the one who brightens the light of the sun, and it was in the darkness.The destruction is the fire of love in its heart, and it is born from that situation, its will to the abortion of your condemnation.إذا عَرَفْتَ هَذا فَنَقُولُ: إنَّ تَرَتُّبَ الفِعْلِ عَلى الإرادَةِ ضَرُورِيٌّ لِأنَّ الإرادَةَ الجازِمَةَ الخالِيَةَ عَنِ المُعارِضِ لا بُدَّ وأنْ يَتَرَتَّبَ عَلَيْها الفِعْلُ وتَرَتُّبُ الإرادَةِ عَلى The heart hurts as well as a warning, for whoever hurts his heart with the causes of the scene of a custodian of all it is imperative that he will get in his heart the will of the payment of the payment and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same This is the thing that is a majority of freshness, and a motivation for the benefits is also a warning, so all of these paths are harmful, so how can you get.It remains that it is said: the inside is under the mandate is the knowledge, except that there is also a problem, because that science is either that it is a harmful or a view, and if it is a harmful, if it is not Under the time of administer and topple as well, and if it is a view, it is a result of the fierce sciences.The group of these fierce sciences produced for the first theory science, either that it is sufficient in that production or is not enough, if it is sufficient, it was sufficient, it was the knowledge First produced on those harmful and obligatory sciences, and who must arrange it on what is outside the choice, it was also out of the time So there must be something other, then that one of the fierce sciences is a fierce, then if it is a hall, then the one who imposed it is not sufficient, and it was sufficient, this is a successor, and if it was behind, if it was from The first science of the theory was determined to the science of other theory before it, so it was not the first of the sciences.The theory is first for the theory, and this is backward.Then the words in that first, as before before it, then it is obligatory to seize it while it is referred, and it was proven by what we mentioned lastly that the saying of the Almighty: and it is upon us, and it is upon us Mental for the mental evidence, and that the elders of the verses opposed to this verse are pronounced.As for his saying: You are the merciful repentance, it is presented.The third type: His saying: Our Lord and the sending of them a messenger from them and know that there is no suspicion of saying that his saying: Our Lord and the sake of them is a messenger who wants a messenger Our offspring is a Muslim nation for you, because it is reminded of before and his description of his offspring with that that only fulfills the nation of Muhammad, and he is a blessing.Our Lord and the sabid of them are a messenger of them, and this supplication is beneficial as the state of his offspring from two voices: one of them: that there is a messenger who will complete them and the religion of them and the one who will complete them and the religion of them They prove it to Islam.The second: That that is the one who is from them, not from them, and it is for it: one of them: to be their place and arrange them in (P-60), the glory and the religion is greater, because the one who was From his offspring, he was honored for his request if he was answered to her.And the second: that if it is from them, then they know his birth and his origin, and he will bring them closer to them in the knowledge of his sincerity and his safety.And the third of it: that if it was from them, the people were keen on their goodness, and he would be separated from them from the foreigners, if he was sent to them, if you are proven, then he said: If he said: The religion of religion is immediately and in the future, and he has been overwhelmed by his belief that that is fulfilled and completes that the people would be from his offspring, so it is good for him to do so that he would not be from him.That is the end of the person who is intended in religion, and the great secret is added to it that this matter is in his offspring because there is no glory or honor higher than this arrangement.As for the Messenger, he is Muhammad, and he is indicated by his faces: one of them: the consensus of the interpreters, which is an argument.And the second: What was narrated from him, peace be upon him, said that he said: His saying: And a missionary with a messenger who comes after me, his name is Ahmad [Al -Saf: 6].And the third of it: that the grace of peace be upon him, but he called for this supplication with the maak of his atom, who are in it and what is around it and what it did not have to do with it Muhammad.Here is a question, which is that it is said: What is the rule in the remembrance of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, with Muhammad ﷺ in the chapter of prayer, where it is said: O God, pray to Muhammad and Ali, on the authority of Muhammad Abraham?And they answered him from his face For Muhammad, peace be upon him, where he said: Our Lord and send a messenger from them, and your verses are attached to them, so when the creation is upon him, he has the right to his right He has the right to make his remembrance of his nation to the Day of Resurrection.And the second: that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, asked that his Lord with his saying: He made me a sincere tongue in the last of the last [Al -Shua’ar: 84], it means to keep me in the mother.And God Almighty answered him and his remembrance of his remembrance of his love for the sake of the good, upon him in his nation.And the third of it: that Abraham was the father of the religion for his saying: the religion of your father Ibrahim [Al -Hajj: 78] and Muhammad was the father of mercy, and in the readers of Ibn Masoud: He himself and he is the father of them.”And he said in his story: With the believers, a merciful and merciful [Al -Taba’a: 128] and peace be upon him said: When each one of them had the right to the righteousness of the face of the face of their remembrance in the chapter of praise and prayer.And its elevation: that the righteous of peace be upon him was the caller in the pilgrimage: and he authorized people to perform Hajj [Hajj: 27] and Muhammad, peace be upon him, was the one who calls the religion: Amran: 193] God gathered upon them in the beautiful remembrance.And know that he was exalted when he asked for a messenger of them to them, he mentioned that messenger with adjectives.The first adjective: His saying: Your verses are recited to them and in it and Jahan: The first: that it is the difference that was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ because the one who did not come to them So it is obligatory to carry it on it.The second: It is permissible for the verses to be the flags indicating the existence of the components and his attributes of his pursuit and the highest He carries them to believe in it.The second line: its saying: The book and what is meant are that it commands them to recite the book and teach them the suffering of the book and its truths, and that is because the recitation For its sake: it is a meeting with the sake of the Sunnah of the people of frequency, so it remains a sacred from the prohibition (P-61) and the correction, and it is that it is for its memorial ﷺ, and it is that in his recitation be the type of worship and obedience, and it is that his readers will be in the prayers and the sacrifices of worship, the types of worship, so this is the ruling The most honorable and the most intense is the knowledge of the evidence and the rulings, because God Almighty has described the Qur’an with his guidance and a light and a light for what is in it and the one who is in it, At first, the recitation was reminded of after it, after which he learned his truths and secrets, and he said: The book teaches them.The third adjective of the attributes of the Messenger ﷺ his saying: the rule, that is, and teach them the wisdom.Know that wisdom is: the injury is in The saying and the work, and it is not called a wise except for those who gathered for him the two things and it was said: The origin of it is from the rulings of the thing, that is, I repeated it, as if the rule is the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one It is what we mentioned of the injury in the words and the verb, and put everything its position.Al -Qaflal said: Some of the philosophers have crossed the rule that it is analogy to God to the destiny of the human energy.And those who are intended in the wise of the ruling, we are on the authority of it: He said: The definition of religion, the jurisprudence is in it, and the follower is for it.And the second: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The rule is the Sunnah of the Messenger of God ﷺ.It is the saying of Qutah, the companions of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The evidence for him is that he is the highest recitation It is intended from the rule that is out of the book, and that only the year of the Messenger, peace be upon him, is said, if it is said: Why is it permissible to carry it on the authority On the neutrality, justice and prophecy?We said: Because the minds are accepted by that, then this is the sake of what is not beneficial from the first leg.And the third: the rule is the separation between the right and the falsehood, and it is a source in the sense of judgment, such as the seat and the sitting.The meaning: teach them as your book, which you download to them, and separate your judiciary and your rulings that you teach them, and example: the experience, the experience, the virginity, the virginity, the virginity, the virginity And humiliation and humiliation.And its lord: The book teaches them the ruling verses.And the ruling on it wanted the signs.Fifth: The book teaches them, meaning they teach them the rulings in it.And the ruling that he wanted to teach them the wisdom of those bodies and the faces of the interests and the benefits, and among the people who said: All the descriptions of the book, as it is the right of the book, as it is the right of the book, as it is.And that it is wisdom.The lines of the loyalty of the Messenger ﷺ: His saying: He will be zakat and know that as a person’s condition in two things: one of them: to know the truth to his self.The second: that the good is known for the sake of doing it, for if it is given something of these two things, it is not clear from the shores and the purity, and it was not for it.Fadl and Al -Walm, add it to the remembrance of Zakat from the shores and the disclosure, so he said: He commends them and knows that the Messenger is not able to do so on, With the ability to bring him this ability, but it is not inhabited by it, otherwise it is that zakat in them, in the way of album, not on the authority of the good The Zakat is the same: the first: what the recitation does, and the knowledge of the book and the rule, so that this is like the cause of their flowers, and that was what was Peace be upon him, from the promise and the dates, the preaching and the remembrance, and the release of that to them, and from the clinging to the matters of the world until they believed in the world, so they believed, and they believed, and they believed It does many things from this gender to be strengthened by (P-62) their habitat to faith and good deeds, and that is his praise is the Almighty, and it is a good man.The second: Zakat them, he testifies to them that they are the best of the Day of Resurrection if he testifies to every soul with what they have earned, as the zakat of the Zaki, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been the one who has been The problems of his intention to pray, because his intention is to gather for this deer with heaven, and that is only fulfilled by the knowledge of the book and the ritual of the ritual Work and exhaustion of the disgrace of work, which is zakat.This is the summary of this verse, and for those who are interpreters in it, there are words: one of them: Al -Hassan said: He purifies them from their evil, so the verse was shown on that A ignorance, there is no wisdom in them, or a book, and that the evil is imprisoned, and that it is a transcendence that sends a messenger from them that purifies them and makes them the rule of the land.And the second: Zakat is the obedience to God and the salvation of Ibn Abbas.And the third of it: it is zakat on the evil and the bridges of the arrogance, as its saying: The good women are permissible for them, and the hidden ones are forbidden for them [Al -Araf: 157] These calls were sealed with the blessing of God, and he said: You are the dear, wise and dear: it is the one who is not overwhelmed, and the wise is the scholar who is not a scholar who is not a matter What was doing was right and innocent about the messenger and the shed, and had it not been for his being, as well as the answer to the supplication, nor the mission of the messengers, nor to remove the book.And know that the dear is one of the attributes of the selfs, if he wants to destroy it on the things and abstain from the digestion and humiliation, because if it is a balance of the needs, it will not be done, and it will not be done.To be prevented from his intended until he joined him, he is dear, not referred, and the wise is, if he wants the meaning of the knowledge, then it is one of the attributes of the self, then if it is the same.Glory be to the abuse of the seizure of others, and I want the rule the actions of wisdom, the dear and the wise were not among the attributes of the people, but rather from the attributes of the verb and the one who is the one who is the verdicts The two types of attributes are faces: one of them: that the characteristics of the self are eternal, and the verbs of the verb are not like that.And the second: that the characteristics of the self cannot believe in any of the facts, and the verbs of the verb are not like that.And the third: that the attributes of the verb are the affairs of the actions that are considered to be achieved by the breasts of the effects of the subjects, and the attributes of the self are not like that, and the argument of the one who is unable On Al -Qabih that he said: God must be a wise for himself, and if he is wise for himself, the cub is unable Al -Qabah, and it was not referred to it was not able, but we said: God must be wise because he was not if he had to do so, he would be able to replace him with his time.That God be a god with the ruling of wisdom, and that with the agreement is referred, and as for the rule, it contradicts the action of the fool, so it is also known to the beginning, and the one who is in the beginning, and the abundance, and the abundance, and the abundance, and the abundance, So knowing in the beginning, then the ears of divine cannot be reported with the act of fooling, and as for the fact that it is not possible, then it is clear, so it is not the same Al -Qabeh.The answer is about it: As for our people, there is nothing of the actions, as a shed from it, the question is still, and God knows best.
