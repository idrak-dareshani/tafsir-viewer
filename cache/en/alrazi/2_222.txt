The Quranic researcher (P-54) The fourth judgment in the menstruation and ask you about the menstruation, say it is harmful, so let the women in the menstruation and do not approach them until it is more So, God bless you, God loves the repentance and loves the purification, the Almighty saying: And they ask you about the menstruation, say it is a good You bring them to purify themselves, and if you purify them, then come to them from where God is your command.The first: Know that he was the highest in this place, six of the questions, so he mentioned the first three with the first of the waw, and he mentioned the three of them, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was The first journeys were located in separate conditions, so they were not given a rudder of kindness; Because every one of these questions is a beginner question, and they asked about the three times that are the last three in one time, so he came to the risk of gathering for that, as if he said: On the authority of the wine and the easy, the question is about such, and the question is about such.* * * The second question: “It was narrated that the Jews and the Magi were overwhelming in the way of the woman if she was in her menstruation, and the Christians were gathering them, and they did not.The woman did not eat it, and they did not drink it, and they did not sit on it with bedding and did not hold it in a house as a matter Muslims with the backs of the verse, so they will leave them from their homes, so people from the Arabs said: O Messenger of God, the cold is severe, and the clothes are a few, for you are the most effective.The house of the house, and if we have been affected by the time, then the prayer is upon him.As the reactions of the lampsters.The Messenger of God ﷺ, so I told him with that and said: O Messenger of God, do we not marry them in the menstruation?He came to him as a gift from milk, so the Prophet ﷺ to them was sent to them, so they did not know that he did not get angry at them.* * * The third question: the origin of the menstruation in the Sayyan language, it is said: the fasting and virtuous, Al -Azhari said: And from it it was said to the opposite: a ritual; Because the water is menstruating to it, that is, it flows to it, and the Arabs enter the waw on the yaa and the water on the waw; Because they are from one sex.If you know this, then we say: This building may come to the position, such as the stake, the essay, and the absentee, and it may also come in the sense of the source, it is said: And it became clear, and the one said in “Al -Bassit” on the authority of Ibn Al -Sakit: If the verb is one of the three of the three, it is like: the same as a prolonged, and it is menstruating, and it is like it, then the name of it is broken, and it is a broken, and it is a good Own, and this is its tendency, it goes with the fragmentation to the name, and the opening to the source, (P-55), even if they open them all or break them in the source and the name of the And the living, the absentee and the absent, the path and the path, so it was proven that the menstruation was a fact in the position of menstruation, which is also a name for the same tenderness, and if this is the same, then this is the same, and if this is the same, then this is the same The interpreters of the literature claimed that what is meant by the menstruation is the menstruation, and when I am not like that; If if what was meant by the menstruation was the menstruation, it would not have said it: So they disgraced the women in the menstruation with the meaning of it: so let the women be in the menstruation, and the intention will be in the menstruation So it will be a phenomenon from the recovery of it, according to the secret and without the knee, and when this prevention was not fixed, the saying is necessary to say that it is necessary The verse, and it is known that that is the disagreement of the original, but if the menstruating woman carried us on the position of menstruation, the meaning of the verse was: so disgrace the women in the position of the menstruation, and the meaning of the meant The position of incitement is from the women, and on this estimation does not divide the verse, copying and not specialized, and it is known that the memorization is if it is a blessing between me, and it is between me, and it is between me, One of them is obligated to be warned and on the other, that warning is not required, for you are the sake of the memorization on the meaning that does not have to be warned, then this is if we are grateful.A blessing between the position and between the source, with that we know that this is the most exploited in the position more and more famous than it in the source.If it was said: the indication is that it is intended from the menstruation that he said: (It is a harm), that is, the menstruation is harmful, and if it was intended from the circular, the place is not true.We said: It is possible that the menstruation be a phrase of menstruation, so the menstruation is in itself, it is not harmful; Because the menstruation is a reflection of the special blood, and the harm is special, and it is a symptom, and the body is not the soul of the show, so it is necessary to say: He is a harm, and if it is permissible, then it is permissible for us to say: It is intended that that position is harmful, and also why it is not permissible for it to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The second menstruation is the position of menstruation, and on this estimation, what you mentioned is removed from the forms, so this is what I have in this position, and God is the loyal.As for the saying of the Exalted: Say: He is a harmful, so he is a gift, a giving, and the sixth: that is, dirty, and know that the harm in the language is what he deems to be from everything, and his saying: So be the one who is in the right.Removing the thing, came to the remembrance of the cause, which is harm, then the judgment arranged upon him, It is the responsibility of the retreat.If it was said: The harm is only blood, and it is the time of the woman, with the retirement of the woman in the maid, and it is not obligatory, so this is arrested.We said: The cause is not an obligatory; Because the blood of the menstruation is a poverty blood that is born from a virtue that the woman pushes the woman from the way of mercy, and if this preference would be seen, the virtue of the path of the woman, then the blood of the woman.The patron of the state and the abstract, so it was harmful and dirty.I have in this section, and it is a medical sit -in, and with its report, the phenomenon of the Qur’an is saved from the stabbing, and God knows his will.* * * The loyal question: I know that the blood of the menstruation is described with a realistic characteristics of the realities, and it is separated from it.The one who is the one who is menstruating is a blood that comes out of the womb.Mental and lamb, and as for the bloodshed, it does not come out of the womb, but it is from the veins that are cut off in the mouth of the womb, he said, peace be upon him in Safah.Burn, "and this words support what we mentioned in the payment of the contradiction from the release of the Qur’an.And the second type: from the characteristics of the blood of menstruation: the attributes that described the Messenger of God ﷺ the menstruation of menstruation with them: one of them: that it is the most supportive.The second: It is two pills.The third is that it is a consequence, and it is the intense of its free intensity.And the lobby: It comes out with a junction and does not flow.And the fifth: He has a unpleasant smell with the disagreement of the blood of blood; This is because it is a virtue that the kindness is pushed.Sixth: It is a sea, and it is the hardness of the red, and it was said: What you get in it is a paradise that similar to it with the water of the sea, so this characteristic is the characteristics.Then from the people who said: The blood of the menstruation is distinguished from the blood of the maid, for every blood was described by these characteristics, so it is the blood of menstruation, and what is not like that The matter is in it, as the origin is the meeting of the clogged, and its demise is that it is for the menstruation, so if it is not the knowledge of the existence, the rest of the costs were the same.Among the people who said: These attributes have been affected by the cost, for the positive contemplation in that blood and in those attributes requires hard and hardship Difficulty when the blood was obtained in which the ruling was the ruling of the menstruation.The description of that blood, and the intended of this is the overthrow of hardship and the hardship of the cost, then the legal rulings of the menstruation are the prohibition of from Prayer and fasting, the income of the mosque and the touch of the Qur’an and the readers of the Qur’an, and the woman becomes a language with it, and the ruling is the constant of the man On what we have indicated, how is the significance of the verse on it.* * * Fifth question: People disagreed in the period of menstruation, so the Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, said: The least of it is a day and night, and the most of them are five days, My father is a student, Ata ibn Abi Rabah, Al -Awazi, Ahmad, and Isaac, may God be pleased with them, and Abu Hanifa and Al -Toryi said: The least of three days and the people of them, and the one who will be, then we are, then we are.And most of it was the same days, Abu Bakr al -Razi said in the rulings of the Qur’an: Abu Hanifa was saying by saying a bid: The least menstruation is a day and a night, and a night, One day, then left it.Malik said: Do not be able to do so in the few and many, for if there is an hour, then it is menstruation, and if there are days, then, then the Abu Bakr al -Razi, the rulings of the Qur’an, Malik said, and he said: If the estimated was fell in the few and many, it would not have to be the menstrual blood that is the bloodshed from the woman, so it would be obligatory that there is no one in the debt.Because all of these blood will be in place on this gold, and that is false with the nation’s consensus; Because it was narrated, “Fatima built the daughter of Abu Habish, I said to the Prophet ﷺ: I am menstruating, so I will not be purified.” ﷺ To them: All of that is menstruating, but tell them that there is something that is in tenderness and it is what is contradictory, so this saying was invalidated, and God knows.Know that this argument is weak; Because there is a saying that he says: The blood of menstruation is distinguished from the blood of incubation with the adjectives mentioned by the Messenger of God ﷺ to the blood of the menstruation, so if we know it, then we know.We taught us to judge us with the intensity of the menstruation, and if we repeat the two things, the menstruation of menstruation was unjust, and the meeting of the depression, which is the origin of the knowledge (P-57) There is no jewelry in the face of the original climb, for this method is characterized by menstruation from the maid, and if it is not made for the menstruation of time, the one who is a long time, and the one who is a long time.The Prophet ﷺ indicated the tick of the blood of menstruation and his description of his saying: “The blood of the menstruation is the submissive supplied Under his words, the Almighty: So dismiss the women in the menstruation, and under the words of peace be upon him, peace be upon him, to Fatimah, the daughter of Abu Habish: The second pilgrimage: that he said in the blood of menstruation: It is a harm, so they disgraced the women in the menstruation, remembered and described it as a harm in the exposure of the bond of the heart, but it was the same.The denial of the denominator in which it is, And the corrupt color and the powerful one in which it is in it, and if it is the heart of the delayed, it is related to this suffering, then when this suffering is done, this suffering is required.The masculinity in the book of God Almighty on the path of permissibility, and when I say that the money is very strong The blood of menstruation was found on the day with his night and in the adulterers on the tenth, with the same way that he is peace be upon him and described the blood of menstruation that he is the same as the one who is a good, then the one who is a good one, then if it is the same.The menstruation, so the entry of the general saying of the Almighty: So they disgraced the women in the menstruation, we left the work with this indication at least on the day and night, and in the most of the most, and in the greatest of the day Between me and Abu Hanifa, so he must remain action in this period.The second pilgrimage: The Shafi’i has on the side of the Ziyah, what was narrated that it was ﷺ when he described the humanity with the decrease of religion, so he was pleased with that he said: “ It is praying, "and this indicates that menstruation may be five ten days; Because on this estimation, the purification also will be five ten days, so the menstruation will be half of its age, and if the menstruation was less than that, it is not the same.Its age, Abu Bakr al -Razi replied from him from Jahin: The first: that the wicker is not the half, but rather some.The second: It is not found in the world that is a woman who is a tame, half of her age; Because what has passed from her age was before the age is from her age.The answer is about the first: that the halita is the half, it is said: I have been disturbed, that is, I made it two descriptions, and it is said in the proverb: the milking of a milk for you, that is.And on the authority of the second that his saying, peace be upon him: “One of them is the disturbance of its age, and it does not pray.Bakr al -Razi on the saying of Abu Hanifa from the faces: the first pilgrimage: What was narrated from Abu Imam on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: Abu Bakr: If this hadith is correct, then no one is just.The second pilgrimage: What was narrated from Anas ibn Malik, and Uthman ibn Abi al -Aas al -Qafii that they said: The menstruation is three days and four days to ten days.And the one who has been subjected to it from two sides: one of them: that if the saying appears from the companions and did not violate it, one was gathering.The second: that the ability is what is not a reason for the mind when it was narrated from the companions, so the most promising is that he heard it from the Messenger ﷺ.The third pilgrimage: His peace be upon him, Humanah, the daughter of Jahsh: The menstruation of all women will be in every month This is destiny, our immorality is this phenomenon in the three to ten, so what is meant in the original.The righteous argument: His peace be upon him in the right of the women: “What I have seen from the deficiencies of the mind and religion that is the most difficult of the minds of the doors of them, so what are you?He said: One of them is the days and the Laylas are not praying.This news indicates that the period of menstruation is what is on the name of the days and the least, the least of which is three, and the most of them are ten; Because it is not said in the one and the two days, it is not said in the twenty days, but it is said: One day is one day, but the three to the ten said: To Fatimah, the daughter of Abu Habish: And the days were kept in three to the twenty, and in the hadith of the mother of peace in the woman who asked him that she was burning blood, so he said: She menstruates from the month, so the prayer is left for that destiny from the month, then to be lined up and prayed.If it was said: Perhaps that woman was incapable of that fate.We said: It is upon him, peace be upon him, what he asked about about the destiny of her menstruation, but he was judged by this judgment as divorced, so he indicated that the menstruation is divorced with what is in the way of what is wrong with what is not.Also, he said in the hadith of Adi Bin Thabet: “The maid is invalidated by the days of the days of its urbanization.” This is a year in all women.The fifth pilgrimage: It is a pilgrimage that the grave mentioned from the dismissed hooks in his “interpretation” and he said: The imposition of fasting and prayer is necessary for the perpetrators of the general.Their must leave the work with it in the three to the ten, so it is obligatory for the original in the first place without the three and above the ten; That is because while the three of the three came to the scholars, so he inherited a suspicion, and we did not make it urged, and he did not exceed the tenth, so it is also the same as the scholar.Limb, so we did not make it urged.And by God, the Exposition.* * * The sixth question: the Muslims agreed on the sanctity of the intercourse in the time of menstruation, and agreed on the resolution of the enjoyment of the woman with the authority of the ritual, And they differed in that it is permissible to enjoy the pleasure and above the knee, so we say: If the menstruation is broken by the position of the menstruation of what is on the authority of what we have made The prohibition of the intercourse is only, so there is no significance in it to prohibit what is behind it, but rather who says: If the thing is devoted to the remembrance, it indicates that it is the same He says: This verse indicates a solution except for the intercourse.He says: The work is left with this verse as above the secret and without the knee, so the rest is kept on the sanctity.And by God, the Exposition.As for his words, the Almighty: Do not bring them closer until they are purified, and if you purify them, then come to them from where God is your command, so know that he said: It is said: The man is close to his wife if he collected her, and this is like a confirmation of his words, the Almighty: So dismiss the women in the menstruation, and it is also possible to carry it on the same His saying: So disgrace the women in the menstruation, forbidding the patchy in the place of blood, and saying it: (And do not bring them closer) Place.(P-59) In the verse: The first question: the reader of a lot, a benefit, Abu Amr, Ibn Amir, and Jacob Al-Hadrami, and Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim: Fear of purity, and he read Hamza and Al -Kisa’i: (He purifies) with stretching, as well as a threshold from Asim, so whoever relieves the blood of blood; Because “purified” from the purification of the woman from her menstruation, and that if the menstruation is cut off, then the meaning: Do not bring them closer until they go away from them, and whoever is a blood.He is in the sense of purifying, so he touched it as his saying: Oh, the binding [Al -Muzammal: 1], and you who are inattentive [the consequences: 1] that is, the muddam.And by God, the Exposition.* * * Al -Awazi, Al -Shafi’i, and Al -Tuari, and Al -Mashhour on the authority of Abu Hanifa, that if you see the purification without ten days, it is not closer to her husband, and if he saw him, he will see it.Before the abandonment.The argument of Al -Shafi’i from two sides: The first pilgrimage: that the frequent readings are a pilgrimage with gatherings, so if two readings are received, and the one who is gathered, the gathering is between them Among them.If this is proven, then he says: Read until he is purified by lightness, infection, and (purified) by lightness, with a burden of blood, and the abundance of blood.Purification of water, and the collection between the two of the two things is possible, and this verse is required to be on the authority of the two things, and if it is necessary, this is not the same.The second pilgrimage: that his saying is up to the Almighty: if you purify them, then they will comment on the purification of the word (if), and the word (if) for the condition in the condition, The condition is a number of condition, so it is not permissible for the two to be permissible when the purpose of purification.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, is the Almighty: Do not bring them closer until they purify themselves, and they will end up with their closeness and make the end of that They are their men The forbidden is that this forbidding does not remain at the time of decay.The judge answered him that if he had been fired on his saying: until they were purified, then what you mentioned was necessary, but when he was guided by his saying: So if it is clear.This is in a house that the man says: Do not speak so that the house enters the house, so if it is good after the entry, then he will speak to him, then he will be talked His words in all of the two things, and if it is proven that it is necessary to decrease the incitement from the purification, then they have disagreed with that purification, so he said: Some of them said: It is the washing of the place, and a bid and a dress said: It is that the position is washed and risen, and the correct is the first; Lujahin: The first: that the appearance of his saying: If a ruling is purified by the same woman, then it is necessary to get this purification in all of it.The second: that his pregnancy on the purification that specializes in menstruation with his mustache or more from purification that is proven in the maid, as it is proven in the menstruation The abolition, and if it is possible for the existence of water, and if it is excused, then those who say that the rituals of the abandonment are gathered.With the consensus, otherwise it is necessary that it is permissible for its proxies except when the water is wrapped.(P-60) * * * And a mortality and Akarmah: So they came to them in the dead, for he is the one who commanded God, and do not pay them as long as the dead, and his saying: From where you are in the matter of God: As his saying: If he wants to pray from the day of the Friday [Friday: 9], meaning: on the day of the Friday.The second: The deaf and the dagge said: That is, they came to them from where they will be cheat for you, and that is that there are no cries, no conflicts, and no forbidden.The third: It is the saying of Muhammad Ibn al -Hanafi: So they came to them by the permissible without immorality.The closest is the first saying; Because the word (where) is a reality in the place, it is metaphorically.As for his saying: God loves the repentance and loves the purification, so the words of the interpretation of the love of God Almighty, and in the interpretation of the repentance, may not be done We say: Approach is the most common of what is called a repentance, and it may be said: This is from the right of God to be exalted from where it is more in the acceptance of the repentance.If it is said: the appearance of the verse indicates that it loves the multiplication of repentance, and the mind indicates that the repentance does not fit except with the sinner, whoever is a sinner The repentance is not improved.And the answer is from two faces: the first: that the cost does not believe in the girl from The default, so the repentance is obligated to pay for that permitted default.Al -Thani: Abu Muslim Al -Asifhani said: (Taba) in the language of the return, and the reference of the servant to God Almighty in all the things that are Hamid.The judge was subjected to him that the repentance, even if it is in the origin of the language, is a phrase for the return, except that it is in the knowledge of the urbanization of the denomination, and what is in the past, He should not do the same in the future, so he must carry it on this lawless meaning without the linguistic concept, and my father is a Muslim who answers it This answer is that if the sake of the memorization can be carried on the legal repentance, then the memorization is valid and peace be upon the question, and if you are excused by the lap The original; Like the stabbing and the question.As for the saying of the Exalted: He loves the purification, in his faces: one of them: it is intended from it to be hidden from sins and sins; And that is because the repentance is the one who did it and then left it, and the purification is the one who did what he did for him, and there is no third for these two divisions, and for the sake of you; Because the sin is a spirituality of spirituality, and for that he said: The partners are unclean [the repentance: 28], so it is left to be the purity of spirituality, and this is the meaning A cleansed purification from where it is, which is removed from the signs and the dome, and it is said: so -and -so is the pure.And the second saying: that what is meant: does not come to her in the time of menstruation, and that he does not come to the time of what comes to what he said: So they will come to them from the matter of God and who said: Because it is up to what is before the verse; Because he said a story about the people of Lot: they release them from your village that they are people who purify themselves [Al -Arif: 82], so his saying: He loves the one who is more intense.And the third saying: It is up to us when he commanded us to purify it in his saying: If you purify it, then the crown of the purification of the purification, then he said: With water, and the Almighty said: A men who love to purify them, and God loves the purification [Al -Tabah: 108], so he said in the interpretation: They were the one who sneaks.
