The researcher of the Quranic, the transcendent: They said: Be a sophistication or Christians, to be guided, say, but the religion of Abraham Hanifa, and what was from the polytheists, I know that it is up to the one who was clear.The validity of the religion of Islam, then it was narrated from the likeness of those who are obedient to Islam.The first suspicion: it was narrated that they said: Being or Christians are guided and did not remember in the report of that likeness, but rather they will be infer The suspicion is from the faces: the first: he mentioned a synodes, and it is his saying: Say, but the religion of Abraham Hanif and the report of this answer is that if it is the way of the debt of the debt Following the mourning of Abraham, because these disagreement have agreed on the authenticity of the religion Recruitment, as if it was his grace, he said: If the one who is dependent on religion is on the basis and the view, then we have provided the evidence, and if the dependent on the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is dependent on the one Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and the Leave of Huddah and Al -Nasraniya.If it was said: Isn't every one of the Jews and the Christians claiming that he is on the debt of Ibrahim, peace be upon him.We said: When you have proven that Abraham was saying by al -Tawahid, and I have proven that the Christians say that the trinity, and the Jews say that it is like it Peace be upon him, and that peace be upon him, peace be upon him.Let us return to the interpretation of the province: As for his saying: They said, Being or Christians, so it is not permissible for him to be intended to be used, as the one who knows is not the case Nazranism on the Judaism, but rather it is unbelievers.And what is known is from the state of the Christians, too His saying: You are guided, that is, if you do so, you will be guided and you will be at the Sunnah of Restruction.* * * As for his saying: Rather, the religion of Abraim is in the injury of “The Bill” of four sayings: The first: Because he was kind to the meaning of his saying: Being, and he said: Follow the Judaism.Say: Rather, follow the mortality of Abraham.The second: on the deletion of its estimation: but follow the birth of Abraham.The third: its estimation: but we will be the people of Abraham, so the added and the added of the added to him is the same as his standard as his saying: and ask the village: The lord: the estimation: Rather, follow the religion of Abraham, and read (P-74) the lame: You are good in making it starting or telling it.* * * As for his saying: Hanif, who has two questions: the first question: the people of the language in the Hanif said: The first: that the Hanif is the righteous, and it is said to the arrogance: As they said to the son: Silim, and for the destruction: a reward, they said: Everyone who is Muslim to God and did not go away from him in anything, then he is a love, and he is a mur.Al -Qarashi.The second: that the Hanaf is the downs, because the compassion is the one who tends to each one from its feet to the other with its injustice, and it is taught if it is money, so the meaning is that the righteous is upon him to the peace of the peace To him, and his saying: Rather, the religion of Abraham is a Hanif, that is, contrary to the Jews and the Christians, who were forbidden to them, and the interpreters, they mentioned the words: Al -Hassan and Mujahid: The Hanafi is the pilgrimage of the house.And the second: that it follows the right, from a Mujahid.And the third: Following Abraham in his partner, which is the bouquet of Islam.And its booster: the salvation of the work and its estimation: Rather, we follow the religion of Abraham, which is the neutrality of the deaf.The nicknames of religions, and its origin from Ibrahim, peace be upon him.The second question: In the text of the Hanif, they said: One of them: The gospel said that he was on the state of Ibrahim as I said: I saw the face of a person.The second: He poured on the piece, but he wanted the billion of the homes of the Hanif, so when the thousand and the blame fell, the denial did not follow, so he said, so he said: Coffee.* * * As for his saying: And what was among the participants is in his faces: one of them: that he alerted him on the authority of Juda and the Christians is a shame on what he has shown, because he has shocked him They said: Azir, the son of God, and the Christians said: The Christ is the son of God, and that is a blessing.And secondly: The Hanif is a name for those who condemned the two sons of His Excellency, peace be upon him, and he knew that peace be upon him, who came with a special partner, from the pilgrimage of the house, and the end of the house, Hanif, and the Arabs condemned these things, then they were shared, so he was said for this: Hanif and what was among the partners and his opposite said: With him [Hajj: 31], and his saying: What is believed to be more than God is only and they are shared [Yusuf: 106] The judge said: The verse is indicated that it is for us to be exalted.The contradiction to his saying: a fool of it, and if that is a pilgrimage in itself, because it is known that it is peace be upon him, and he was not in need of him These words, but he was invoked by the brilliant miracles that appeared on him, but peace be upon him, when he had established the argument with it, and the heart was made.They are passed on to them, so that there is an argument for them from the pilgrimage.He embellished what they were on, and he said: If the religion is with the following, then the one who agreed upon it, and it is the religion of Abraham, peace be upon him, who followed.And it is a saying to say: Jews and Christians, if they are preferred by the precedence of Abraham, and those who read that Abraham was not one of those who say that they are alleged, and the triangle, They must be the one who said that it is imprisoned and the jurisprudence, and when they said that they were not in their call to it, and if they were denying it, or if they were disbelieving, then they were a good They are associated with it, but they denied it as a denial of the embodiment and the triangle, and that was not agreed upon it, so it is not true that it is not correct.It was for him to take it as a first.The answer is that it was known for the frequency that the prohibition of peace be upon him, what has proven the child to God Almighty, and when it was correct for the Judy (p-75) and the Christians, they said that they said: For the way of Ibrahim, peace be upon him.
