The Quranic researcher said: The Almighty said: We did not make the people of the fire except an angel, and we did not make them only a temptation for those who disbelieved so that those who have been disbelieved in the book, and those who have gone out of the book, The writers and the believers are suspended, and the saying of those in their hearts is sick and the infidels, what God wanted with this, for example, and in which the two questions: Because of the temptation of the infidels from two faces: The first: that the infidels are mocking, they say: Why did they not be twelve, and what is the one who is required to be summarized?The second: that the infidels say this few, how they will be with the torment of the most inventory of the world from gin and humanity from the first thing that God created to the one who created God?As for the people of faith, they do not seek these two questions.As for the first question: Because the sentence of the world is ethnic, then it is necessary for it to be for the good deeds from which the sentence of this world has been fulfilled - and a number of you The question, which is that it is not allocated to that number of finding, and that the number was not increased by the number of another Approximately, the world was delayed from the creatures with the estimation of a period of time, and it was not a period of time.It was found in appreciation of a moment?Likewise, the saying in the estimation of each one of the events with his appointed as a certainty, and each one of the bodies with its limited parts of the numbers, and there is no answer from it, and there is no answer Faten, and the choice is that the thing is likely to be like it, and if this answer is the one who is used in the creation of the sentence of the world, then this is in this way.The second question is also weak; Because it is no longer in the capacity of God to give this number of power and power what they become in it, and those who are able to do the torment of the term of creation, Clear, and in the course of the path of these two questions about the praise in the fullness of God, as for those who are known to be the Almighty, who is unable The resurrection in the different conditions of the world is removed from its heart, this follower is the whole of the kidneys.The second question: He who said: He may be exalted, he would want to deliver this verse.(P-181) It indicates that the original intended is the temptation of the disbelievers, the disgrace answered from it from the faces: one of it: Al-Jubayi said: What is meant by the one who is the one To be inferred and know that it is a loyalty to strengthening these nineteen on what is not strengthened by one hundred thousand A strong king.And the second: Al -Kaabi said: What is meant is from the graceful temptation until the believers are delegated Take the faith in it.And the third of it: that what is meant by the temptation is what they have fallen into from the infidels because of their denying the number of treasury, and the meaning: except for the temptation of those who have been disbelieve What they said, and that is a punishment for them for their disbelief, and it has a return to the leaving of the roll, and the answer: that there is no conflict in anything from what you mentioned, except that we say: The signs of the effects of piety of infidels, or not?If there is no effect on the piety of disbelief, its removal was as the captains of foreign affairs, so it was not for the saying that the landing of this is the same They disbelieved the face of the bit, and if it has an effect on the piety of the disbelief, then the intended, because if the act of the verb, the doctrine of the act, has become a reason, then it became a reason for the ritual And the one who is armed is forbidden to affect, so the blessing is the one who is the one who is a matter The similar things are four: the first of them: to be sure of those who have given the book.And the second: and those who believe in faith.And the third of it: and those who have been disobeyed the writers and the believers.And the one who has been said: And to say those who are in their hearts are sick and the infidels are what God wanted with this, for example, and he knew that what is meant by the interpretation of these verses is only the question: The first: The Qur’an is indicated that it is the highest of the infidels of the infidels with the number of Zabiya, because of these four matters, so what is the face in that?The answer is that it did not make their deadlines in the number of these things, and its two bodies: the first: the estimation: and what we have made them, but the fabrication of the same Those who have given the book, as it is said: I did such that to glorify you and to despise your enemy, they said: And the emotion may be mentioned in this position, and it is tired.The second: that what is meant by his saying: We did not make them only a temptation for those who disbelieved is that he did not make us counted only nine ten; However, he put a temptation for those who disbelieved the position of nine ten; As if he expressed the influencer with the indicative memory on the effect, alerting him that this effect is from the impact of that influence.The second question: What is the effect of the impact of this similar to the book of the book of the book?The answer is from his faces: One of them: that this number is what was supplied in their writers, then he is peace be upon him.Rather, he obtained the reason for the heaven, for those who believe in Muhammad ﷺ from the family The book is faithful to it.And the second: that the mourning and the Gospels were deported, so the people of the book were reading in them that the number of Zabiya is this destiny, but they were not the one who was on the authority of all of you.Perhaps their knowledge of the way to burn to these two writers, so when they heard that from the Messenger of God ﷺ their faith is strong with that, and they are the right to the truth.And the third of it: that the Messenger of God ﷺ he knew from the state of Quraysh that when he told them about this strange number, they are mocking him and laughing at him, and they are laughing at him It is in the proof of the neutrality, the ability and the knowledge, with those of these questions clarifying and showing it, so how is the remembrance of this numerous number?Then, their mockery with the Messenger of God and the intensity of their mockery with it is what he prevented from the emergence of this truth, so that this knows that every one is a good man.And the prejudice is to be removed from the remembrance of this (P-182), the amazing number, so when he mentioned it with his knowledge that they must be mocked by him Tabl Al -Lahi, and that it was not in that, neither by believing the believers nor by denying the lies.The third question: What is the effect of this occurrence in the increasing faith of the believers?Answer: The cost is not invoked as the highest scholar in all the information, rich in all of the juveniles, which is distinguished from the liar and the backwardness, and it is not for him.The enemy is known to its fact, so if it works with the brutality of those evidences, then he made the talisman knowledge that it is true that he does not lie in a wise man, who does not lie in a wise man, who does not lie in a wise man, who does not lie in a wise man.The pride is from this strange number, then it can believe in the truth of this number, and there is no doubt that the believer becomes the one who is more than this.For the evidence and the most vulnerable to the religion, so what is meant by the increases of faith is this.The loyal question: the truth of faith when you do not accept the leadership and the shortcoming, so what is said in this verse?Answer: We carry it on the fruits of faith and its effects and bases.The fifth question: When the emancipation was proven to the people of the book and the increase in faith was proven to the believers, so what is good is in his saying after that: And the believers?The answer: If the one who is required, if it is a lot of the argument, the semi -suspicion, then if the human being drew in it, and the leanness of it, then it will be overlooked, and it will be overlooked by the one who is lost The accuracy, so the suspicion and suspicion will come back, so the rituals of the lean in some cases do not contradict the rituals of the clothes after that, so what is meant by returning this words is that it is that it is the words Jazzam, where his head is not a doubt, no doubt.The sixth question: the Jamour of the interpreters said in the interpretation His saying in their hearts is a disease: they are the infidels, and Al -Husayn ibn al -Fadl al -Baghli mentioned that this surah is an angel, and it is not a place of money This verse is not in the sense of hypocrisy, and the answer: the saying of the interpreters is a right, and that is because it was in the knowledge of God Almighty that the hypocrisy will happen, and he will speak to the The expression of this verse is incapable, because it is a news about a absence that will fall, and it has been signed on the age of the news, so it is miraculous, and it is permissible for it to be the same.Because the people of Makkah were the most complainant, and some of them were seized with lies.The seven question: He endowed that the emancipation and the survivors of the clothes are valid for us to be intended from the removal of this similar, so how is it true that it is the saying of the disbelievers What do you think?Answer: As for our origin, there is no formation because it is exalted, guiding whoever is, who will be misled, and who will come, and the increase will come to this in the following verse, and as for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the case When the width was likened in his place, it was located, and the letter was entered upon him, and it was like him: and he had been given us to Hagnam [179].The eighth question: Why is it an example?The answer: that when this number was a strange number, the people thought that it may not have been that God would not have what I felt with him, but he made him like him Another exclusive, whose heavens, for example.The ninth question: The people were denying that the Qur’an is from God, so how did they say: What did God want with this for example?The answer: As for those in their hearts, they are satisfied, and they are the hypocrites, and they were in the apparent, affiliated with the fact that the Qur’an is from God, so they did not say that they said that On the path of recklessness or on the way to the recipient that the Qur’an was if it was from God, he would not have said like this.(P-183) * * His saying is the Almighty: Likewise, God will deliver whoever creates and guides those who follow the face of the recipient with the verse of the people who are back, because he is the one who is mentioned.I only promised them a temptation for those who disbelieved and then mentioned in the end of the verse: Let those who are in their hearts say the disease and the infidels, what God wanted to do so, so he said: Whoever creates and guides who will be.As for the disgraceful, they mentioned the famous faces that were: one of them: that what is meant from the misguidance is the prohibition of the sins.And the second: that when a people were chosen by their choice when we descend these verses, and the people of their choice of their choice when we descended from that are like that The misguidance is these verses, and it is like it: they increased faith and its saying: they increased them as a predecessor.And the third of it: that what is meant is from his saying: it is misleading and from his saying: He guides - the ruling of God with his being lost and his crying is guided.And the one that is: It is upset The day of resurrection is misled by the house of the reward, and this word is with its wages, it was presented in the cow wall in its saying: He will be misleading with it, and there is a lot of it.[26] * * His Excellency said: What the soldiers of your Lord know is nothing but it is in it.These nine ten days are only that each of them has the agents and soldiers, what their number does not know except God.And the second: And what the soldiers of your Lord know for the excess of its many are only he is, so the treasury is not honored for him, but for him in this numbers, he does not know.His majesty knows it.And the third of it: that there is no need for God, the Glory of Him in the torment of the infidels and the immorality to these treasury, for it is the one who is tormented by the truth, and it is the one who creates the words of the The heart of a hair in the eyes of Ibn Adam, or the authority of the pain on one of the veins of his religion.The torment, so the soldiers of God are not careful because his destiny is not deadly.His Excellency said: It is only a male for the good tidings in his saying, and what is it to what is he returning?In it, say: The first: that he is a domestication to “a satellite”, and the meaning: and what I have described is only a reminder to the good.The second: It is domesticated to these verses that are intersted from these similar, and it is a male for all the worlds, and if the one who increases with it is only the family of faith.* * * Then the Almighty said: All in which there are faces: one of them: it is a denial after making it remembered, to have a remembrance because they are not remembered.And secondly: It is a deterrent to those who deny that one of the old age is a vow.And the third of it: it is a deterrent to the saying of Abi Jahl and his companions: they appreciate the struggle of the treasury of the fire.And the sequence of it: It is a deterioration from the trial of the exclusive enemy.* * * Then the Almighty said: The moon and the night, when he managed to say: The first: The lighter and the dagger said: He made it “and narrated that Mujahid asked Ibn Abbas about his saying.He was tired of this (P-184), and he said: Rather, the appearance of the camel, the one said: The two readings are at the people of the language, whether it is what we mentioned, The one who left the dowry and gathered them with an important terror, such as the eminent of the second saying: Abu Ubaidah and the son of Qatibah said: What came after the day.The night, that is, came after the day.
