The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: God is the guardian of those who believed in the darkness to the light to the light and those who disbelieved their first people who bring them out of the light to the darkness In it, they are immortal.There are two issues: the first question: “the guardian” is an act in the sense of an actor from their saying: I have the same thing, and he is a lion, and he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, Al -Hudhali said: ؎ I promise Awad without you, and you are the ones who are said: Because he is close to you with love and victory and does not separate you, and from him the guardian, because he follows the people with mobilization, command and forbidding, and from the loyalty.And then they said in the disagreement of the mandate: the enmity is from the time of the thing if it was overlooked, so for this, the state was the disagreement of the enmity.The second question: Our companions took this verse that the kindness of God is exalted in the right of the believer, while it is related to the debt that is more than the righteousness, in the right of the righteous, in the right of the righteousness, On the authority of those who believed in the concern, and knowing that the guardian of the thing is the one who is the one who is the reason for the human being and the residence of the matter of the one who is in the authority For his sake, the Almighty said: They repeat from the mosque, the forbidden, and they were not the guardians that his guardians are only the righteous [Anfal: 34], so he made the guardian of the mosque, and for the sake of the mosque.The disbelievers are to be his guardians, so when the meaning of the guardian is sponsored by reconciliation, then he is upholstered, he made his soul to me, for the sake of the believers.In their reconciliation, according to what is guaranteed in the interest of the disbelievers, and when the one who is disgraced is that it is up to the disbelievers and the believers in the guidance and the goodness, and the one who is the same The verse is invalid for their saying, the disgrace said: This specialization is based on one of the faces: the first: that this is the same as the increase His saying: Those who guided them increased their guidance [Muhammad: 17] and his report from where the mind is that good and obedience call for some to some of you, and for you to be A sitting in which the preacher runs, for he is the right of his heart, fear, subjugation, and brokenness, and it is the state of separation of the state of those who have the heart of the heart of the heart, It is valid in the believer from the roll that is not valid, so that the believers were specialized that he is the highest of them.And the second face: It is an adequate to be rewarded in the hereafter, and it specializes in the valuable nickname and the great honor, so the specialization was based on it.And the third face: which is that it is the Almighty, even if it is the guardian of all in the sense of his being, sponsored by the validity of all over the level, except that the one who is the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Specialized with this verse, as in His saying: Haddah for the righteous [Al -Baqarah: 2].(P-17) The Fast face: It is the Almighty and the believers, in the sense: that he loves them, and what is meant is that he loves their preaching.The companions answered about the first that the increase in the roll is when you can be obligated to you, and God will not be exalted in the right of the believer except the performance The believer did what is for the sake of it, it is required of God that more than the kindness.As for the second question: that it is an adequate that it will reward it in the hereafter, it is also distant; Because that reward is obligatory for God Almighty, for the believer is the one who made him attached to God that reward, so he will be his soul, and he is the soul of God.As for the third question: that the benefit of the state of God is the believer, so we say: This matter that the believer has distinguished from the infidel in the chapter of the mandate is from the authority of And the servant is on this saying, the servant himself is not.As for the fourth question: that the mandate is with her love.(And the answer): The love with it is to give the reward, and that is the second question, and we answered us.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: He brings them out of darkness to the light, so he has two questions: the first question: I am gathered by those who are intended, and that is from the darkness, So the verse is openly in that God Almighty is the one who has brought the human being from the disbelief and enters it into faith, so it is necessary that faith be with the creation of God; لِأنَّهُ لَوْ حَصَلَ بِخَلْقِ العَبْدِ لَكانَ هو الَّذِي أخْرَجَ نَفْسَهُ مِنَ الكُفْرِ إلى الإيمانِ, وذَلِكَ يُناقِضُ صَرِيحَ الآيَةِ.The dismissed answered from two faces: The first: that the lame from darkness to the light is based on the stab of the evidence, the abuse of the prophets, and the landing of the books, the book, and the book, and the book, and the book, The faces, and the warning about the disbelief in the most deserving of the faces, and the judge said: God has attributed the Almighty to the idol in his saying: My Lord, they are more than a lot of people [36] For the sake of that idols are due to their misguidance, then the lame from darkness to the light is added to God Almighty with the power of the reasons that he did.And the second face: that the lame can be carried from the darkness to the light that it is amended from the fire from the fire to paradise.Al -Qadi said: This is in the truth, because what happens from that in the hereafter will be of his action, as if he did it.The answer to the first of two faces: one of them: that this addition is a truth in the verb, and it is metaphor in urbanization and desire, and the origin is the luxury of the memorization of the truth.The second: that these desires, if they are influenced by the prevalence of preacher, the most correct and obligatory, and the one who is armed is obedient, and then the saying of the said; and that It had no effect on the hypothesis, and its name was not correct.As for the second question: It is the pregnancy of the memorizer on the enemy from the fire from the fire to the paradise, it is also a burden from two sides: The first: The one said: All that was in the Qur’an is from the Qur’an to the Qur’an He wanted the infidels and faith with it, (P-18), other than the words of the Almighty in the Surah al-Anam: He made darkness and light [Al-Anam: 1], for he means the night and the night, and he said: Because it is like a darkness in preventing awareness, and made faith a light; Because it is like the cause in the acquisition of awareness.The second answer: that the enemy with the believer from the fire to the paradise is a matter and is obligatory for God to be exalted at the dismissed, so it is not permissible to carry the memorial to it.The second question: His saying: It brings them out of darkness to the light.The first saying: that the memorization will be made on its appearance, which is that this verse is specialized in whom it was infidel and then Islam, and those who say this saying: Mujahid said: This verse was descended in a people who believed in Jesus, peace be upon him and a people who disbelieved in it, so when God sent Muhammad, he believed in him, and he believed in him.Issa, peace be upon him.And its second: that the verse was descended in a people who believed in Jesus, peace be upon him, on the way of the Christians, then they believed after him with praise ﷺ, and they were in them.And atonement, because the saying of the union is disbelieving, and God is upset out of those darkness to the light of Islam.And the third of it: that the verse was revealed in every infidel of Islam, Muhammad.And the second saying: that the memorization is carried on everyone who believes in Muhammad ﷺ, whether that faith was after the infidelity, or it is not like that, and it is not that, and it is not.It brings them out of light to darkness, even if they are not in dark darkness, and it is indicated by his permissibility: the Qur’an, the news, and the knowledge, but the Qur’an said: The fire will save you from it [Al -Amran: 103] and it is known that they were not in the fire, and he said: When they believed, we revealed the torment of the treachery [Yunus: 98] The bit, and he said in the story of Joseph, peace be upon him: I left the religion of a people who do not believe in God [Yusuf: 37] and there was no one in it, and he said: Whoever is from you, and he said: 70] And they were not in a cat, and the news is my narration, “He ﷺ heard a person who said: I bear witness that there is no god but God, and he said: On the innocence, and when he said: I testify that he is the one who said: He came out of the fire.I take your arguments.I have anything in it, not that it was in it and then it was brought out of it, and it will be fulfilled that the servant was that the success of God is up to the Almighty, and he will fall into the dark To drive those darkness from it, and between the payment and the raising of the ritual, in this way, this way is permissible to seek the rituals of the exit and the dimension in the sense of payment and the mourning.Exalted: And those who disbelieved their first people, know that he read the good.For the companion, and also showed us in the detection of this memorization that it is a paradise, not a collection.In this verse, the infidels are not from God, they said: Because he was exalted, he added it to the tyrants, with a metaphor with an agreement.And this is confirmed by the words of the Almighty: Lord, they add a lot of people [Ibrahim: 36], so he added the misguidance to the idol, and if this is the addition of us, and if this is the addition of us, and if this is the addition of us, and if this is the addition of us, and if this is the addition of us, then this is the addition It is out of the argument for you.The infidels and the tyrants are with, so it is a milestone for all and back; And God Almighty knows the right.
