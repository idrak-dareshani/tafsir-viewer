The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: O you who believe, spend what we have given you before, a day will come in it, there is no sacrifice in it, no disorder, no rhythm, and the disbelievers are the one who knows Things to the human being in the fighting, and the money of money in spending, when the matter was presented with the battle, he followed it with the matter of spending, and it is also in it, and it is an end in it, He preceded his saying: They fought in the path of God [Al -Baqarah: 190] Then he followed him with his saying: Who is the one who lends to God a good loan [Al -Baqarah: 245] Once a second time, he confirmed the matter of fighting and mentioned the story of the heels, then he followed it with the matter of spending in jihad, and he said: O you who believe.If you know the face of the systems, then say: In the verse, the first question: So we say: God is up to the expenditure of everything that was a livelihood of consensus, either as it was forbidden, it is not permissible to spend, and this is the benefit of the cut that is the ritual, and it is not.The verse, even if it indicates the spending of everything that was sustenance, but we allocate this matter to the spending of everything that was a permissible livelihood.The second question: they disagreed that his saying: (spend) is specialized in the obligatory spending like zakat, or is it general in all agreements; Whether it was a duty or a delegate, Al -Hassan said: This matter is specialized in zakat, he said: Because he said: From before he comes a day, there is no goodness, and no He turns only to the duty, and the most said: This matter is the duty and the delegate, and it is not in the verse and a feast, as it was said: Get the benefits of the last, If you are (P-175), if you come out of the world, it is not possible to obtain it and its acquisition in the hereafter.And the third saying: that what is meant by spending in jihad: and evidence is that it is mentioned after the matter of the struggle, so it was intended to spend in jihad, and this is the saying of the deaf.The third question: Ibn Katheer and Abu Amr (no sale, no disorder, no rivalry), with the installation, and in Surah, may God be upon him, peace be upon him, and there is no sale in it.In it, and there is no sin [Al -Tor: 23], and those who are all raised, and the difference between the monument and the raising, it has mentioned it in its saying: there is no journey, no, no, no * * * The following question: The intended from the verse is that the human being comes alone, and there is nothing with him from what he obtained in the world, he said: “And we have come to us.Once, and you left what we have authorized you behind your appearance [Al -Anam: 94] and he said: And we inherit what he says and bring us an individual [Maryam: 80].As for his saying: There is no sacrifice in it in its fabrics and the Jahan: The first: that the sale is here in the sense of the accent, as he said: on the day is not taken from you a ransom [Al -Hadid: 15], and he said: It is not accepted from it.[Al -Baqarah: 123] and he said: [Al -Anam: 70] So he said: Before he comes a day in which there is no merchant in it, then it is acquired by what you are in from the torment.The second: that the meaning is: offer to yourself from the money that is in your king before the day comes to which there is no merchant and no construction until the money.As for his saying: There is no disturbance, the good deed, and its counterpart from the verses is the saying of the Almighty: the evacuation of the day, then some of them are the enemy, but the emancipation: 67] The reasons were cut off by them [Al -Baqarah: 166] and he said: Then the day of resurrection will disbelieve each other with one another, and some of you curse some of you [Al -Ankabut: 25], and he said: A firm friend [poets: 100-101], and he said: And the persons who are supporters of the supporters [Al -Baqarah: 270], and his saying: There is no reaction that requires the denial of all intercessions.And he knows that his saying: There is no vulnerability, nor a general reckoning in all, except that the evidence of the evidence indicated the evidence of the affiliation and love between the believers, and the people of the people, and to the one who is the one who is the one who is the believer, and to the one who is the ones And he explained it in the interpretation of his saying: And fear a day in which you will return to God [Al -Baqarah: 281] Do not reward a soul for something and it is not accepted from it [48].And know that the cause in the numbers of immorality and the day of the day of resurrection are matters: one of them: that every one is busy with himself, on what he said: for every one of them Sing it [Abs: 37].The second: that the severe fear is overwhelmed by every one, according to what he said: The day you see it, so that every breastfeeding woman is grateful for what you have brought up and put all the same pregnancy With a driver [Hajj: 2].And the third: If the torment comes down by the disbelief and the immorality, it becomes hated for these two things, and if it becomes hated for them, it becomes hated for those who were not.As for the saying of the Almighty: and those who are unjust are the unjust, then he was transferred from Ata ibn Yasar that he was saying: Praise be to God who said: And the disbelievers are the unjust and the unjust: The disbelievers, then they mentioned in the interpretation of this verse and its faces: one of them: it is up to what he said: There is no breach, no reaction, or that is the negation His obstacle: and those who are unjust are the unjust to indicate that this negation is concluded with the disbelievers, and on this estimation, the verse is made by a sign (p-176) The immorality, the judge said: This is the one who is not correct; Because his saying: and those who are unjust are the unjust words, as it is not obligatory to be attached to what was presented.The answer is that if we made this speech, the successor will be made to the words of God Almighty, because the other who disbelieves may be Unjustly, but if we suspend it from what is presented, the forms are removed, then the destiny is obligatory to attach it to what before it.The second one: that if the disbelievers enter the fire, they may be rewarded for the disturbance of that torment, for God Almighty did not oppress them with that torment, but they are the injustice of them Choose disbelief and immorality until they became eligible for this torment, and his counterpart is the Almighty saying: And find what they did present and do not oppress your Lord [49].And the third one: that the disbelievers are the unjust, where you leave you, the goodness of the good for the day, and they needed them, and you need them, and you are the present.The new choice, but they came to yourself what you make it on the day of resurrection as a ransom for yourself from the torment of God.And the righteous interpretation: the disbelievers are the unjust to themselves with the position of things in other than its positions, so that they can be signed by the ritual of the one who does not have any of them They used to say in the second: These are our lips for God, and they also said: We do not worship them except to bring us closer to God, so whoever worshiped and sits When God has unjustly lost, where the good signs of those who are not permissible to sign of it.And the fifth interpretation: What is meant by injustice is to leave the spending.And the disbelievers who are blessed to spend in the path of God, and the Muslim, it is not possible to spend anything from it that has been less or more.And the sixth and the disbelievers: and those who are unjust are the unjust, that is: they are the whole in the darkness, the great, the great in it, as it is said: the scholars are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the whole, So, so, and most of these faces have mentioned it as the rest of God, may God have mercy on him.And God knows.
