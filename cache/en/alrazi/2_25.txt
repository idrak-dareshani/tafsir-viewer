The Quranic researcher, the words in the re -said, are the Almighty and the good of those who believed and the righteous did that they have gardens that run from the rivers, as they were given from them from the fruit of this We have been brought before, and they were similar to it, and they have purified wives in it, and they are in it.Reading and showing the punishment of the infidel and the reward of the obedient, and from the habit of God, he is the one that if he mentioned a verse in the return, he will follow it with a verse in the promise, and here is the question: Honorable and publishing is one of the common issues in the validity of religion, and searching for this question is either that it is on the authority of its place or from its fall.As for the possibility, it is permissible to prove it by the mind, and the eulogy is the last, and the fall is not a way to it except by transfer.And that God mentioned these two questions in his book and the truth has been shown in them from his faces: the first direction: that many of the denials were narrated from the denial, the denial of the deny He ruled that it is a satellite that is not the same as the evidence in it, but it is permissible for that because everything that does not stop the validity of the prophecy The transmission, and this question is like that, so it was accompanied by the transmission, for example, what is governed With the preacher, but in the proof of the law and the evidence of the prophecy, he was not satisfied with the claim, but rather mentioned the evidence, and the difference is what we mentioned, and he said in the surah: “ Those who disbelieve that they will not be sent.The second face: It is the highest of the possibility of the possibility of the precedence and the publication, based on the fact that it is a loyalty to matters that resemble the evil and the publication, and the decision of God is the Almighty.So what came in the surah of Al -Waqi'a, as it is the highest in which it was a story about the people of the north that they were saying: What are we died and we are dirty and the bones of us, we are not.And God Almighty answered them with his saying: Say that the first and the others are all groups to the meeqaat of a known day [Al -Waqi’ah: 50].Then he transcended his mother with four matters: the first of which is: His saying: You have gone out of what you wish, when you create it, or the Creator: [58] Thus, the semen is obtained from the grace of the luxurious digestion, which is like the prolongation that is stabbed in the horizons of the parties of the members, and this is why the members are involved in the vitilo All of them, then God Almighty The power of the lust over the rest until it collects those of the long parts, so it is the one that the parts were separated from the first, in the first place, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first of the He gathered it in the body of that animal, then she was separated in the parts of that time of that time, so God gathered her, and he is the one who is a good man, and then the water of the semen, then the water of the semen, then the water of the the womb.If these parts were separated, then they were collected and formed from that person, then if the death is separated from one time, then how do you think it is a time?This is the report of this pilgrimage, and God is the Almighty mentioned in the positions of his book, from it in the Surah of Hajj: O people, if you are in the Lord of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who creates the Hajj His saying: The earth is seen as an important [Hajj: 5].Al -Qabbar [Hajj: 7], and he said in Surah, the believers have come after the remembrance of the creation of the creation: Then you are after that, then you will come.Surah Al -Tarq: Let the human being, with what created from a dug water that comes out [Al -Tariq: 6] to his saying: He is on his return to Qadir [Al -Tariq: 8].And the second: His saying: You have seen what you are in plowing, you will grow it [the incident: 63], to his saying: Rather, we are beaten [the incident: 67], and the face of it Check and other stained, such as rice and barley, and a rounded, trick, and square, and otherwise on the one who disagrees with his doorstep if it is located in the land of the water and the water is the water And dust, the mental look requires that it be transgressing and spoiling; Because one of them is sufficient to obtain the pardon, so they are all first, then it does not spoil, but remains an antimacker, and then if the wet increases, the love will be separated It comes out of it and two tenderness, and the longest appears in its heads of dumplings, and the lengthy time appears as in the cultivation, and the nuclei is what is in it.By her, he is miraculous from his thorns, if he falls into the dewed earth, he is raised with the permission of God, and the nucleus of dates is separated from a click on the back of the noon Two descriptions that come out of one of the two parts, the endeavor, and from the second part of the link, as for the endeavor, it becomes up, and the bond is divided into the depths of the land, The small nucleus are two trees, one of whom is a saaned light, and the other is a strong and impressive.A complete and complete wisdom, so this Qadir is how it miraculously from the collection of the parts and the installation of the members?And his counterpart His Excellency said in the pilgrimage: and you see the earth as a thorough one, if we have the water on it, it was divided and raised [Hajj: 5], and the third: It is the Almighty saying: “You will see the water that you are.” The decorate is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a bunch of patch, and the stabilization of the hero is a matter of the disagreement of the ritual.The printing is cleansed, overwhelms the private, and escalates what is the dowry and the descent.And the second: that these water atoms gathered after their separation.And the third: it is easy.And its seller: its removal in the widow of the need and the earth, and all of that indicates the busts of the wise.As for the struggle of the ethnic, because it is the heart of the pill, so if it is permissible, then it is not permissible to show life and wetness from the impact of dust and water?The second: When he was destined to collect these water atoms after separating them, why wouldn't the collection of dusty parts be permissible after their separation?And the third: the winds of the winds, if it is destined to move the winds that include some of those big And the lifted: He raised the clouds for the need for people to him, so we are the need to create the costs once again to reach what they deserved of reward and punishment.He knew that God Almighty has expressed this significance in another position of his book, and he said in the families when he mentioned the connotations of the neutrality: that your Lord is God, who is the one who is: [54] A relative of the good two [Al -A'raf: 54], then he mentioned the evidence of the good, and he said: He is the one who sends the winds [Al -A'raf: 57] to his saying: Likewise, we will leave you.[Al -A'raf: 57].And the one who said it: Its saying: You have come to the fire that you have created, you have created its trees, or we are the ones who are the creatures [the incident: 72], and the face of the fence is that Habbah, also the fire is funny and the tree is thick, and the fire is also a light and the tree is dark, and the fire is hot, and the tree is a cold, wet Inside that tree, the Nurani parts of the fires, so it was combined with its ability between these competing things, so if it is not possible for it to be exalted, then it is not possible for you Ownership and their intimidation?And God Almighty mentioned this significance in the surah of Yass, and he said: He who made you from the green tree a fire [Yass: 80].He knew that he was the highest mentioned in this surah, the matter of water and fire, and he mentioned in the mourning the matter of the air by saying: I will guide you in the darkness of righteousness and the sea: [63] The creation begins and then returns it [ants: 64], and the earth mentioned in the pilgrimage in his saying: The earth is seen as an important [Hajj: 5], as if he was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.Its condition is a witness that it is good and published.The type The second of the evidence is indicative of the possibility of al -Hashor: it is that it is a loudness that says: when I was able to find the first, so that I would be able to return first.This is the indication of its mind in the mind, and that it is the highest mentioned in the positions of his book, from it in the cow: how do you disbelieve in God, and you will be disbelieve He will live for you, then you will return [Al -Baqarah: 28], and from it his saying in the Glory of the one who said: “If we were bones and showers, we are a good creation,” 50], to his saying: Say: The one who broke you first time [Al -Israa: 51] and from it in the curse: I did not see how God begins the creation and then returns it [19] The Romans: He is the one who begins creation and then returns it while he is the one who has the highest ideals [Al -Rum: 27], and from it in Yass: Say: He will revive it, which he established first [79].The third type: the reciprocate of its condolences on the heavens on its condescension to the thorns.And that is in verses, including in Surah Sabihan: I did not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the same as them [Al -Israa: 99], and he said: And the land with the leadership of the likeness of the like, which is the knowledge of the knowledgeable [Yass: 81], and he said in the endowment: Om they did not see that God who created the heavens and the earth and did not know On the authority of my death, he will revive me that he is able to do all of it.A dead country, as well as the elderly [Q: 11], then he said: We are aware of the first creation, but they are in the dress of a new creation, [Q: 15].The luxurious type: the cursing of the filling of the human being that it is imperative to reward the good and the dissolution of the disobedient, and the one of them is distinguished And God really promised that he begins creation and then restores him to reward those who believe and do righteousness with the installment [Yunus: 4] and from it in Taha: that the time is the time Let every soul be rewarded with what you seek [Taha: 15], and from it in p.We make those who believe and do righteous deeds like the spoilers in the land, or do we make the righteous like the workers [p.28].The fifth type: the reciprocate of the mud in the world in the validity of the good and the publication, so it was created by Adam - upon him the prayer and peace - and it is the one who says: So we said they were raised by each other, as well As he passed through a village and she is a fear of her veins [Al -Baqarah: 259], And from the story of Jesus and Jesus on them, peace be upon them.And from it in the story of the companions of the cave, and for that he said: Let them know that the promise of God is a right and that the hour is not a doubt in it [the cave: 21], and there is the story of the one who is peace [Al -Anbiya: 84] It indicates that he is up to them after they died, and from them what God has appeared to be upon the hands of Jesus - peace be upon him - from the neighborhood of the death in which he said: It is created from the clay as the goodness Something [Maryam: 67].The verses are the prayer to it, if God wills, the Almighty.Then it is the Almighty in the Qur’an that the denial of the evil and the publication is an infidel, and the evidence is upon him his saying: He entered his paradise while he is the unjust of his soul, he said: I think the hour is standing, and if I repeat to my Lord, I found it better than it.The entry of this thing in the existence is possible to provide it in itself, if if it was forbidden for the existence, it would not have been found in the first time, so that it is the first time.It is possible to provide him with himself, and if he would not have been valid from God, the exalted, so that this is either on his either his reward, where he was not able to find what is permissible in the presence Where it is excluded from him, the parts of each one of the owners of the parts That is due to disbelief in cutting, and God knows.The second question: These verses are openly in the form of paradise and the fire are created, but the fire is because it is upset in its class: it was prepared for the disbelief: It is a creature, and the paradise is because it is upholstered in another verse: It was prepared for the righteous [Al -Imran: 133] and because the Almighty said: “And the good of the righteous and the people who did not.” Paradise that runs under the flow of the rivers, and this is a news about the fall of this king and its acquisition, and the king's arrival (P-117) requires the incorporation of the owner in the case, so it will be done on the authority of the ritual.Two creatures.The third question: Know that the gathering of the pleasure is either the dwelling or the recklessness or the marriage, so God Almighty described the Almighty with the saying of it: And the collision with its saying: the word They were given a livelihood from it.The ritual is disturbed, and the Almighty indicated that this fear is a virtuous of them, and he said: They are in it immortal, so the verse is indicative of the talisman of the blessing and the secret.We will now speak to the verse.As for the saying of the Exalted: The good news of those who believe in, in it, the questions: The first question: What is this matter?The answer is from his faces: one of them: that he is not the one who is fulfilled with kindness, is the matter until he is required for him problems of an order or forbidden to be overlooked.Rather, the one who is given to the compassion is the sentence and the description of the reward of the believers, it is the one who is given to the sentence and the description of the punishment of the infidels, as it says: Upha of pardon and release.And the second: that it is given to his saying: Fear [Al -Baqarah: 24] As you say, O sons of Tamim, warn the agony of what you have gone, and preached, and so on the sons of my son.And the third of it: Zayd ibn Ali (and Bashir) read the sake of the builder of the act of kindness on the enemy.The second question: Who is the commander of his saying: and good?The answer: It is permissible for the Messenger of God to be ﷺ and that every one is as he said - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -: He commands that one with his eyes, but every one who is commanded by it, and this face is better and shaken; Because it is permissible to give permission that this matter is his greatness and his luxury, it is true that everyone who is destined to be preached to him.The third question: What is the evil?The answer: It is the news that shows the secret, and for this the jurisprudence said: If he says to his servants: Which of you preached to me so and so he is free, then he will be blessed.Because he is the one who reported his secret, and if he said, he would be pleased with me: Tell me, they gave up all; Because they are all informed, and from the good news of the vicinity of the skin, and the patch of the morning: what appeared from the families of its light, but prevailing them with a torment In which the increased mockery of the mockery of it, as the man says to his enemy: preach to the killing of your offspring and your money.* * * As for his saying: Those who believed and did the righteousness that they have gardens that run from undern by the flowers, so they have an questions: (The first question): This is the one who does not Inside in the name of faith, because when faith mentioned, then the righteous deed was composed, and the abolition was required, otherwise it is necessary to repent, which is the disagreement of the original.(The second question): One of the people who conducts this verse is on its appearance, so he said: Everyone who comes with faith and righteous.He has paradise.If it is said to him: What he said is in what he brings faith and righteous.He said: This is forbidden because the action of faith and obedience requires the fulfillment of permanent reward, and the act of disbelief is the right to punish the permanent punishment, and the whole of them is between them.With confinement, it was not possible until it is said: This is the obligation that you have imposed from it, but we said: The saying of confusion is referred to it (p-118): P-118) The two investigations are either opposite or not contradictory, for if it is contradictory, the emergence of the emergency was shared by the remains of the remaining.Reasonable.And the second: that the contradiction is made from the two sides, so the remainder of the remaining is not for the emergence of the emergency from the rushing of the emergency by the rest of the rest, so that it is found with it, and it is a matter The saying is invalidated by the simplicity.And the third of it: that the two investigations are either equal or the presenter is more or less, so if they are equivalent to it, it was said: He had obtained the right of the reward of the reward of the ten days The one who is ten parts of the punishment, so we say: I deserve each one of the parts of punishment, which is resigned to remove each one of the parts of the reward.And if it was not the effect of this part in the removal of this part, the first of its influence in the removal of that part and from the effect of another part of it Each of these emergency parts influenced by the removal of every one of the parties advanced, so it is necessary for each one of the ills to be many of the most common and many of the high The highly transmitted high -level, and all of that is referred, or that every one of the parts of the parts are summarized by the remainder of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest One of the one who is able to do is likely to be like, but if the presenter is more than more, the emergency is only removed from some of the parts of the rest, then there is no part It has the first of the parties of the parts, so it is that all of it is referred to it; Because the deceased does not disappear except by the deficiency, or the bone is appointed to the darkness from other than a specialist while it is referred, or nothing is removed from it, which is the one who is required.Also, this emergency, if some of the remains of the rest, removes, then the emergency remains or goes away.As for the saying of the emergence of the emergency, there were no one of the minds.As for the saying of his loudspeakers, it is false; Because it is either the effect of each one of them in the removal of the other with or on the installation, and the first is invalid, because the remote is inevitable and that it will be the case of the state of the removal, so the removal is the state The bullies are with the existence of the two decreases together, so it is necessary to be guided by the case when it is referred to, and if it is on the installation, then the molder is evaluated to flip.But if the presenter is less, then the influencer is the result of the disappearance of some parts Some of this is a prejudice that is not likely, and it is referred to, or that everyone becomes influenced by the removal, so it is necessary for him to gather on the one who is the one who is in the same way This mental face is proven with the corruption of the saying of frustration, and when this is appointed in the answer, they say: The first is: the saying of those who expressed the one who is the one who is the one who is a matter He does not die on infidels, and if he died on the infidels, he knew that what he came to first was infidelity, and this is a saying of the backwardness.The second: The servant does not deserve the obedience for rewards, nor on disobedience, punishingly, rational, and it is the saying of the people of the Sunnah, and our choices, and for it, Decisiveness.* * * (The third question): It is possible to carry the verse on it, and it must be carried on the investigation of the fall; Because it is permissible to express the fact that the fall is metaphor.The loyal question: Paradise: the two gardens of the palm tree and the shadow tree with the dehydration of its branches.The installation is constant in the sense of the hardship, as if it is for its condensation and its shadow, it was called the paradise, which is the same time from the source of his paradise if it is prevented, as if it is the same (p-119) (p-119) To overpower its dryness, the house of reward was called paradise because of the heaven, then it was said: Why did the paradise were denied and the rivers were known?Answer: As for the first, heaven is a name for all the reward for all of them, and it is a disgrace to the gardens of many gardens, the arrangement of the consequences of the causes of the facts of the workers, from the two of them, from the two of them Those paradise, and as for the inclusion of rivers, what is meant by the spectrum, as it is said: the two sits in which there is running water, yin and grape The masculinity in its saying: it has a flower of water other than the elderly and the flowers of milk, whose food was not changed [Muhammad: 15].* * * As for his saying: the more they are grateful, then this is not left, either to be a second characteristic of parties, or the beginning of a deleted start, or a sentence of the one who is not.They have gardens, and the heart of the poem was not without it that it is in it that the fruits of those gardens likened to the world of world or not?We are asking: the first question: What is signed by a fruit?The answer: It is in it and the first: the first: it is like your saying: the more you eat from your bond from the two pomegranates, the more you are, so it is signed (from a fruit), the satellite of the saying: The first and the second are all of them to see the end; Because the sustenance has started from the gardens and livelihoods of the gardens, it has started from a fruit, and that is not intended by the pebble one or the pomegranate, and this is the uniqueness of the individual What is meant is one of the types of fruits.The second: It is that it is (from a fruit) to be a way of your saying: I saw from you a lion, you want you a lion, and on this it is correct to be intended by the fruit of the one who is the one.The second question: How is it correct to say: This is what we have now is the one who has gave us before?Answer: When I limit it in the waters, and if you want to numb the number, it is true that it is said: This is that; That is, according to what is good, then the one is not incompatible with the many people, and for that if the son’s similarity is intensified by the father, they said: It is the father.The third question: The verse indicates that they likened their livelihoods, which they bring in paradise with another garden that came to them before that, so the one who is alleged to him is from the one who is from??And the answer is in it and Jahan: The first: It is one of the livelihoods of the world, and it is indicated by Jahan: The first: that the human being with the thousands is human and to the grace of the righteous, then if he does not see what he saw On his authority, then if he disappeared with something from the head of what he preached to him a covenant, then he found his honor from what his first one is a bone, and he was happy with him, and he was happy with him Rummana in the world, then they insist on it in the hereafter and found the pomegranate of paradise, Tayyib and honored than the thieves of the world.The second indication: that his saying: the more they are grateful from them, the first time, then the first time, for the first time of the livelihood of the paradise, will not be the same We have been subjected to before, and it is not before the first time of the livelihood of paradise until it is likened to it, so it is obligatory to carry it on the livelihood of the world.The second saying: that the suspicion of the garden is also the goodness of heaven and what is meant by their livelihoods.Then they disagreed with when the like in which they were received on two sides: The first: What is meant is equal to their rewards in all the harassment in the destiny and the degree until it does not increase or decrease.The second: What is intended is in the view, so it is the second as if it was the first on what was narrated from the good.Then these are different, for those who say: The suspicion is as it falls in the view falls in the rejectionist, for the man if he follows something and wins it, does not comment on him In the same way, if the first similar to all the faces comes from all the faces, it was the end of the pleasure, and among them is those who say: If he gets the suspicion in the color of the one who is in the color of it The food, Al -Hassan said: One of them comes to the press, so he eats from it, then he will come to the end, and he says: This is what we have brought before before, and he says: (P-120) It is different, and in the verse a third saying on the tongue of the people of the knowledge, which is that as the money of happiness is only in the knowledge of God, the highest and the knowledge of his attributes and the knowledge of his attributes Corobia and angels Spirituality, the aspirations of the people, and the world of the heavens, and the sentence must become the spirit of the human being like the destroyed by the world of sanctification, then this is the knowledge He gets it like the fullness of that of the mud and the groaning, and since the urban divisions are hindered by the appearance of those happiness and pleasures, then if this dignity is removed, the gossip is removed The oldest, so what is the one who has a spiritual happiness is found by the human being after the death, then he says: This is the one who was taking place for me when I was in the world Al -Nafisiyyah, which has been obtained in the hereafter, is the one that was in the world, except that in the world, it was not the pleasure, the joy, and the secret, and in the hereafter it benefited this.As for his saying: They came to him, and he has two questions: The first question: The pain that the guilt returns in his saying: And they came to him?The answer: If our saying: The likeness of it is the livelihood of the world, for the analogous thing in the world and the other, the meaning of that is the same as the one who is similar to the one who is similar to it Coordinated from it in the world, and if we say: the likeness of it is the sustenance of paradise as well.Some.The second question: How is it signed by his saying: and they are similar to the word of speech?The answer is that God is exalted when he told the people of paradise a claim that the livelihood is suspicious in his saying: They said this who was our livelihood before, so God Almighty has believed in the heart of the Almighty: They were similar to him.* * * As for his saying: They have purified wives in it, so what is intended is the purity of their eternity from menstruation and majestic, and all the dirms, and the purity of their husbands from all of the ghost With the women, but we were brought to all of the two parts of the two divisions in a blessed destiny.I laid down, God Almighty forbids you from her foresight.In it, if you are the wives in paradise, purifies, for it to prevent you from them if you are in pollute with the pads of sins with the fact that you are not excused.And the second: that whoever has fulfilled his lust is from the permissible, then it is forbidden to enter in the mosque in which all righteousness and abandonment will enter, so whoever has the same is from the righteousness Paradise that only the purification?Therefore, Adam, when he came to the time, was brought out of it.And the third of it: Whoever is on his garment is an atom of impurity that does not correct his prayers at the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him His heart is one of the pads of sins is greater than the world, how to accept his prayers?We are two questions: The first: Did the adjective come as a collection like the Sufis?The answer: They are two eloquent languages.It is said: The women did, and the women did.And from the house of the hamasah: ؎ And if the virgins with the smoke are convinced and used the parking of the pots, then I dictated (P-121), the meaning and the group of the purified wives, and the purpose Ubayd ibn Amir read: (an emergency), meaning purification.The second question: Is it said: a purification?Answer: In (purification) a notice that a purification is purified, and that is only God Almighty, and that is beneficial to the generosity of the people of the people For the people of reward.As for his saying: They are in it immortal, and the disgrace said: The immortality is here is the steadfast steadfastness and the remaining stay that is not cut off, and begging for it, and the poet His saying: And what made us a good time before you, if you died, they were the creators [Al -Anbiya: 34], so he exiled the immortality from the human being with the exalted, and it was given to the one who gave it.However, the deceased is the permanent survival.It is the long steadfastness, whether it is long or not, and they needed in it with the verse and the knowledge, but the verse said it to the exalted: eternal in it [women: 169] and if it was in The immortality was that of that, and the kinship is said: He loved so and so, so that it is a foolishness, and because it is written in your bonds of endowment: He stood up and so that it is a stance, so that it is the same Will it indicate the rewards of the reward or not?Others said: The mind indicates its inception because if it was not obligatory for it, they would have passed away, so it was the fear of the feud, and that of the stomach is overwhelmed; Because the grace is the greater the greatest, the greatest in the heart, and so it is necessary that the people of the reward not be overwhelmed by the dignity of the dignity and the goodness.
