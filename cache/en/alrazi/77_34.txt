The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, is up to him: They went to what you were lying to you, and they went to a shadow with three peoples, not a shadow, and it is not enriched from the flame, as it is a good thing.And the day of the lying of the lies, I know that this is the fifth type of the faces of the disbelief of the disbelievers, and it is the way of the sufficiency What you was lying to you, the meaning is that they are said to them: they went to what you were lying from the torment, and it appears that those who say the treasury of the fire, and the ritual of the fire.Yaqoub read: “Leave” on the past, and the meaning is that they led to the matter for the sake that they are obliged to it, they are not able to abstain from it, Because he was to say: A day for them is a dress or a place, so the sun will be spared them, their raising and take their breath, and the day is extended to that day, then the day of God, then the day of God.His shadow, so they say: Whoever is God, and we have the torment of the poison [Al -Tor: 27] and it is said to the lies: “Leave it to what you were lying to you.” And his saying: to a shadow means the smoke of hell; As his saying: He kept a heat of Yahmum [the incident: 43] Then it is the highest and described this shadow with qualities: the first characteristic: the saying of three peoples in which he said: The shadow, and I have not heard anything in it.And the second: a people said: What is meant by his saying: to a shadow of three peoples, such as the wealth of fire from their own and from the feet of their feet, and the surrounding of them, and the one who is in the authority of the fire, Where it is surrounded by them from every side, such as his saying: They have a shadow from the fire and from under them shadow [Al -Zumar: 16], and he said: Under their legs [Al -Ankabut: 55].And the third of it: Qatada said: Rather, the intention is the smoke, and it is one of its saying: it was surrounded by its chades [Al -Kahf: 29], and the fire of fire is the smoke, then if it is a people from that And a popular people on his journey, and a third people from his sake, and I say: This is not followed; Because the anger is for his right and desire for the north, and the Satanic power in his brain, and all the pests are followed by the human being in his hearts and in his sins and in his sins and in his heart The three, so they were born from (P-243), these are three types of darkness, and it can also be said: We are three trades, which are the sense, fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, and fantasy, The enlightenment with the lights of the world of sanctity and the flowers, and each of these three times is special types of darkness.And the sequence of it: A people said: This is a greatness for the fact that the smoke is great; So The great smoke is divided into many people.Fifth: The father of a Muslim said: It is carried out in “three people” what he mentioned after that, which is that it is not unjust, and that it is not enriched from the flame, and that it is like a bush.The second line of that shadow: His saying is not a shadow, and this is a matter of them with them and an illusion that their shadow is not the shadow of the believers, and the meaning is that the shadow is not the shadow.The third adjective: His exaltation said: It is not enriched from the flame.Because the rich about the thing is his back, as the needy approaches it, the owner of the “scout” said: It is in the place of the neighbor, meaning: and otherwise he is the one who said: It is imprisoned: one of them: that this shadow is only in hell, so it does not remain from its freeness, and it does not leave them from its flames, and God has mentioned in the surah of al -Waqi And Hamim and remained from Yahmum, not cold, nor generous [the incident: 42-44], and this is as if he is in Hell if they entered it, then he said: There is no cold or generous [the incident: 44], and it is permissible for him to be.Meaning: “There is no cold”, and his saying: He does not enrich the flame in the sense: “And there is no generous”, meaning that there is no way for him to seek refuge in him from the flame of the fire.And the second: that you are formed, but before they enter hell, but when they are loved to calculate and offer, and it is said to them: that this shadow does not He pushes the flame of fire.And in the verse (a second face), which is said by Qartb: which is that the flame here is the thirst, it is said: a flame of flame, and a man of flames, and a woman of flame.The righteous adjective: His exaltation said: It is a thief who said: The one said: It is said: evil, evil, spray, and sprays, which is what the fire of the fire is repeated in every one, and the one who is the same, If it appears and its ritual for the sun, and the strayes are simplified, and know that God Almighty described the fire that was the shadow, smoke with it, with the smoke of it.What is meant by him is that that fire is very great, and then it is an exaggeration that likened to that evil with two things: the first: the palace, and in its interpretation: The building called the deficiency, Ibn Abbas said: He wants the bones of the bones.The second: It is not what is meant by that, and then in terms of interpretation, in interpretation, it is a face: one of them: that it is the collection of a minute of the hein of the hunter as a murmur, a murmur, a murmur, and a mur.For the one who is from the thickness of the dazzling wiping: a minor, and the collection is a minor.For the winter, we cut it, and we called it the palace.This is the saying of Said bin Jabir, a fight, and the laughter, except that they said: It is the origins of the palm tree and the bone tree.“Like the palace” with two conquests, which is the neck of the camel or the neck of the palm, the one is a tree and a tree, and the son of Masoud read “as the palace” in the meaning of the palace; Cheerlings and mortgaged, and Said bin Jabir read: “Like the palace” in the collection of Qasr as a need and a pilgrim.The second likeness: His exalted say: as if it is a score of whistle and in which two issues: (P-244) The first question: Like their saying: men, men, homes, and homes, and the son of Abbas read: “stales” by the gym, and it is a reader of Jacob, and they mentioned it: one of them: The righteousness is the righteousness, which is the shore of the ship, and it is said to it: the hearts, and for those who denied that and said: The known in the table is only the phrase in the way of the gym and the stretching of the m..And the second was said: It is the catastrophe of copper, and it is narrated from Ali ibn Abi, who is upon him, peace be upon him and Ibn Abbas, and the great people of the language do not know him.And the third: Al -Farah said: It is permissible for the stories to be in the midst of the beautiful thing, it is said: I am the sum of the account, and the people came as a sentence, that is: the two of the two, and the two of the two, and the meaning, and the meaning, It raised as if it was a thicker, whistling is yellow, and this is the saying of the freedom.And the severity of it: Al -Farah said: It is permissible to say: stales by the inhabitants of the gym.The second reader: “Jamal” by breaking the gym; It is a sentence; Like a stone and a stone, Abu Ali said: The time is only a miserable to the gathering of the gathering, as it was caught in a solution and a state.The loyal reader: “a sentence” by the gym, which is the gossip.It was said: “yellow” for the will of the sitting.As for his saying: “yellow”, they are more than that, blacks are lost to the yellowing.And there is a rest of the fire of the fire, which was more like a bold camel, which is more than the whistling, and some scholars claimed that what is meant is the whistling, not the blackness; Because the evil is, but it is called evil as long as it is a fire, and when it is a fire, it is yellow, but it becomes wandering if it is shed, and there is not called evil, and this is the saying of me.The second question: Know that it is an adult like the evil in the bone by the short, and in the color, the many, the succession, and the speed of the movement with the whistling, and the one who is also said: It is glorified, and it will be like the palace, then it is separated, so that it will be the separate pieces that are followed as the whistling.His saying: It is a minerally like a shortened: this likeness is mentioned in the country of the Arabs, and their shortcomings are the poison of the poison of the confession, so the confession, so that it is the good Like the palaces, when the father of Al -Ala'i listened to this, he would have spent in it and likened it to With the treachery of the blood, and it is his saying: ؎ Hamra is the sacrifice of the duties in Al -Daji, threw all the strokes as a ritual and then the owner of the scouts claimed that it is the same, so that it is the same.And I say: It was the first for the owner of the scout that he did not mention that, and when he mentioned it, we must not fulfill the words in it, so we say: The likeness in form and greatness, as for the form, who is one of them: the first: that the shrash is before its popularity as the point of the fire, so if it is like it, then it is like it.It expands, it resembles the clients, for it is the head like the point, then it is still a little bit.The second: that the shrame is like a hat or a core, it is the severity of the semi -tenth, and the similarity is in the semi -evacuation, and this is the matter of this As for the face of praise in it, it is from the faces: the first: that the colors of the sprays is a yellowish, which is made of some of the black, and this meaning is in the whistles, and otherwise.The second: that the axes are moving, and the clients are not moving, so that the burnting spin is similar to it.The third: that the benefits are followed, some of which are the successor of the bone, and this meaning is in the areas (P-245) yellow, and otherwise it has a wind.The lord: The insignificance is the safest man and the position of his peace, so the evil is similar to the palace, and he alerted him to the fact that he was born from the one From it, security and peace, and the case of the infidel as well; For he was signed by good and peace from his religion, then he did not appear for him a ram and no compassion except from that religion, and the client is not what is from the mother.Fifth: that the Arabs used to believe that all the beauty is in the king of camels, and the blessing of the blessings is to obtain the king of blessings, and this is the Almighty: and you have a beauty in it, and you will be happy.[Al -Nahl: 6] So the evil is similar to the black beautiful, as it is to accuse them of them, as if it was said to them: You were looking at you from your religion, and the grace of it is that it is not.The notifications that are like a camel, and this meaning is not in the wind.The sixth: that the camels, if it is separated and mixed with some of it, then everyone who signed between its hands and its legs in that time has been in the same time The note of it, if it follows it, benefits the crops as the oath of the release, and the kindness is not like that.The swallow: The phenomenon is that the minor is in the manner is greater than the parties, and the whistles are more in the number of the parcels, so you likelihood of these wires with Ziada is required in Al -Muqdar and in the number, and similar to it to the parties, it does not benefit anything of that, and when the intended is the defamation and the elaboration [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
