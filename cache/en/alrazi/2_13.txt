The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: And if they are said to them, they believed as the people believe, they said that I believe as the fools believed in, except that they are the fool The actions of the hypocrites, and that is because it is their pursuit of what he forbade them in the verse that is presented about corruption in the land, which is in this verse with faith; Because, as the condition of the condition of the human being, he only gets the whole of the two things: the first of them: he left what is not empty while he said: believe and here are the questions: the first thing: the one who said: Believe, “Any faith is based on salvation far from hypocrisy, and it is a saying that this verse is inferred by the fact that the inventor of the declaration is faith, for it is that it is not true The name of faith is called unless the salvation is obtained, so it was his saying: they believe enough in the crime of the one who is required, and the remembrance of his saying: As the people believed, the people of the ritual With God, he is the one who is associated with salvation, but in the apparent, it is not a way to it except with the opposite of the apparent.The second question: the blame in the people is in it, and it is: one of them: it is for the covenant, that is, as the Messenger of God and those with him believed, and they are people who are, or the servant of God, and the servant of God Because they are among the sons of their gender, and the second: that it is for the Sans and then we are also and Jahu Two few, and the general memorization may be called the most.The second: that the believers are the people in the truth; Because they were the ones who gave humanity its right; Because the virtue of the human being is on the path of the tales with the rational mind and the calm thought.The third question: the saying: And if they are said to them, believe either the Messenger, or the believers, then some of them said (P-62) for some: I believe as a sake of it.So, and the Messenger does not know that, and the Almighty said: except that they are the fools.The loyal question: the light shed is said: the shedding thing is the thing if it moved it, the tumor said: ؎ So, as the winds were seized, the wind was shaken.Al -Rasim said, Abu Tamam Al -Ta’i said: “His grace, the glimmer is ignorant of his ignorance, if ∗∗∗ I seemed to be the best of the sorry for the sweat, and he wanted the sacrifice of stab The tongue is sorry; Because it is a light, not a homosexuality, and the Almighty said: Do not pay the fools of your mother who made God for you.His mind, but he called the two Muslim people with sorry; Because the hypocrites were among the people of the danger and the risk, and the most believers were unjust, and when the hypocrites were that the religion of Muhammad is invalid, and the falsehood is not.For this The reasons we attributed them to the chaos, then God Almighty has turned against them this title, and the truth said to him to his face: one of them: that whoever is offended by the evidence is the same Sufficiency is sorry.And the second: that whoever sold his end with his life is the sorry.And the third of it: that whoever is blessed with peace and blessings be upon him, he has lost God, and that is the sorry.The fifth question: Rather, he said in the last of this verse: they do not know and before it: they do not feel for the two ways: the first: that the righteous is upon me that the one who is the one A mental matter is a theorizing, and the hypocrisy and the in the form of the prostitute leads to corruption in the land is a harmful, the course of the path of the sensual.The second: He mentioned the fool while it was ignorant, so the remembrance of science was good for him, and God knows best.
