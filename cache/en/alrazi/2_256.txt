The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: I do not deny it in religion.Rashing has been shown from the absence.Hearing knowledge in which there are two issues: the first question: the blame in the “debt” in which they say: one of them: that it is the mother of the era, and the second: that it is a way from the addition, as it is the same, as it is.Holding [Displacements: 41] i.E.: his mouths, and what is meant in the religion of God.The second question: In the interpretation of the verse, it is one of them, and it is the saying of my father, Muslim and the lock, and he is the one who is the one who is the origin of the disgrace: it is that it is the same And the justice, but it was based on the ability and the choice, then the lock was brought up that this is what is meant by the exalted, when it was clear that the al -Tawih al -Tawahid said, the lips of the luxury, he said: That: It is not after the clarification of this indication of the disbelievers is an excuse for residence on the infidels, except that it is associated with faith and forced to it, and it is forced to do so It is the house of the labels, as in the oppression and its dedication to religion, the meaning of the meaning and the two consequences, and the counterpart of this is the saying of the Almighty: Whoever wills, then whoever wills) And he said in another surah: And if your Lord would not have the right to those who are in all the earth, all of them will be disturbed by people until they are believers [Yunus: 99] and he said in Sora.We yourself will not be believers if we grow up from them from the sky, so their necks (P-14) have been subjected to them, for those who are subjected to this.It is up to the Almighty after this verse: The adult was shown from the absence, meaning the appearance of the evidence, and the sons laughed, and the rest of it remained, and the distance remains, and the distance of it.That is not permissible; Because it contradicts the cost, this is the report of this interpretation.The second saying in the interpretation: that his dedication is to say the Muslim to the disbelievers: If you believe, otherwise I will kill you, so he said: I will not give it in religion, but in the right of the right, and in the right Because if they accepted the parting, the killing will fall from them, and as for the disbelievers, then if they are reinforced or were victorious, then the jurisprudence is lost in them, so he said: On him, and on this estimation, the killing will be taken away if he accepts the reward, and on these people, he said: I do not think it in the debt in general in all of the disbelief.The jurisprudence is that if the infidels are the disbelievers, if they are reversed or were victorious, then they do not recognize it, so he said that he will be valid in their right, and he said: The people of the book.And the third saying: Do not say to those who entered the religion after the war, he entered into it, because if it is satisfied after the war, it is true that it is not, and it is not true, and it is not true.His deeds, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: No You say to whom peace be upon you, you are not a believer [Al -Nasa: 94].* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Rashid has been shown from the absence, so he has two questions: the first question: it is said: that the thing is, and it is clear, and it is clear if it appears, and it is clear, and it is clear.The morning is for two eyes, and I have clarification and definition, but it was called Bayan because it signs the chapter and the evidence between the intended and otherwise, and the righteousness, and the righteousness of the And there is two linguistics: rationalization and guidance, and guidance is a source as well as guidance, and the absence of the rationalization of rationalization, it is said: Ghawah is lukewarm and stubbornness, if it is used as a way.The second question: ‌ The adult is shown from the absence, that is, the truth is distinguished from falsehood and faith from the disbelief and guidance from the misguidance in the many ways Rashid “meaning: He has become clear and evacuated with evidence, not that every cost is alerting; Because the information is.And I say: It was mentioned that the meaning of “it was clear” separated and distinguished, so what was meant was that the evidence was obtained between the adults and the absence of the power of the evidence, The memorial was on its appearance.As for his words, the Exalted: Whoever disbelieves in the tyrants, the grammarians said: The tyrant and his time is a deed, we are a garden, and the time is increased, and it is a distress, and it is a distraction, I was overwhelmed, except that the verb did not turn to the position of the eye as their habit in the heart, we have: The movement and the conquest of what was before it, the mourner said in the tyrant: The fasting is for me that it is a collection.Like desires, monotheism, and kingdom, as this is the name of one, as well as this name is unique and not in a group, and what indicates that it is a source The tyrants [the cow: 257], so it was repeated in the position of the group, as it is said: they are satisfied, they are just, they said: This is the preserved falls on one and on the whole, in the whole, in the one who is in the one, in the one who says: They want to be tried to the tyrant and have commanded that they disbelieve in it [Women: 60].[Al -Baqara: 257] And they said: The origin is in it.If you know this, then we say: The interpreters are mentioned in it five sayings: The first: Omar, Mujahid and Qutdah said: He is the Satan.The second: Said bin Jabir said: The priest.The third: Abu al -Ala said: He is the witch.The fourth: some of them said: idols.Fifth: It is the ritual of gin and humanity, and everything is overwhelmed.And investigating that when the tyrants occurred when contacting these things, they were made These things are the reasons for the tyrants as it is in his saying: Lord, they have a lot of people [Abraham: 36].As for his saying: He believes in God, and he has a sign that he must be disbelieved from the first to repent from the infidels, then he will believe after that.As for his saying: I have forgiven you with the righteousness, so I know that it is said: I seek you with the shoes if he touches it with it, and the vein is the whole of the righteousness, Rather, it was called that, because the veil is a reflection of the thing that is attached to it, and the ritual is the obituary, and this is from the matter of the urbanization of the mind; Because whoever wants to hold something is related to his nakedness, then, so whoever wants to hold this debt is related to the evidence that indicates that it was And clarify it, it is not a crime and described it that it is the ethnic vein.As for his saying: There is no schizophrenia for it, in it, the first question: the separation is the breaking of the thing from others, and the separation is the one who is deaf, so the deafness, so the deafness, and the deafness of the deaf This exaggeration; Because if it does not have a schizophrenia, then it would not have a pronouncement.The second question: The grammarians said: The arrogance of the verse: with the righteousness that is not separated by it, and the Arabs are destroyed “the one who“ who is “who is“ who is “who is“ who is “who is“ who is “who is“ who is “who” Bin Gandal: الم And the rally of my blood is to blood with it, as if its necks are the gossip of the merciful, he wants: the hostiles that are, God said: There is nothing but for him a place that is known: * * * Then he said: God is a knowledgeable, in which the saying: The first saying: that he is heard the saying of those who speak to the two martyrs, and the saying of what is said, The believer's heart is the purified belief, and there is no infidelity from the fabricated belief.And the second saying: A giving was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them.That is a secret and a glory, so its saying is: God is a knowledgeable hearing that wants your prayers, Muhammad, with your warning to Him and your deceased.
