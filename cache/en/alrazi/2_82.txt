The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: Those who believed and did the righteous, those who are the companions of paradise in which they are immortal, I know that he was groaning and the highest of what was mentioned in the Qur’an A verse in Al -Waad, and that is for the people: one of it: to show that it is just a chain of transmission, because when he was judged by the suffering of the insisting on the other The permanent nose on the Egyptians of faith.And the second: that the believer must be offended and his fear is to be rewarded for what he said, peace and blessings be upon him: He only gets this way.And the third of it: that it appears with its promise as the mammal of his mercy and his return as the honor of his wisdom, so that he becomes a reason for the Aarsaf, and we are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one: It is outside the name of faith because he is the Almighty said: And those who believed and did the righteous deeds, so if the faith indicated the righteous deed, it was the remembrance of the righteous deed, after the faith of the faith.And if he enters all the righteous works in it, but his saying: He believes that he is not beneficial except that he did one of the actions of faith Good guns.The answer is that the verb of the past indicates the source of the source in a time that has passed and faith is the source.All of those works from him, and God knows.And with the righteous hopes, then he came after that with greatness and did not know about it, so this person was before his enemy with greatness, he had believed that he was true to him.The time, and whoever is believed to him, is believed that he believed and did the righteous, and if it is believed to him, then his rituals must be given to him.They are immortal, if his saying is said: and do the righteousness, it is not true of it unless it comes with all the goods and from the sentences With glows, it does not exist under the verse.We said: We have shown that before the greatness of the great, it was believed that he had believed and the righteous deed in that time, and if it is true for him, then he will be believed to him.Glory; Because when the compound is true, it is necessary to believe the individual, but if it comes with greatness, it is not true that he believed and did the righteous in all the halls, for all of the halls, for all of the halls, for all of the halls, for the sake Al -Sabehs are better than our saying: It is also in all the abnications or in some of the facts, and the one who is considered in the verse is the blessed destiny, so you have proven that it is a rejuvenation.Their saying: that The immorality of the punishment of his disobedience, the reward of his obedience, so that the hypothesis of the promotion of the feud, except that the words upon him have been presented.The third question: The Jaba’i brought this verse that whoever enters paradise does not enter it preferably, because his saying: Those are the companions It is not for Paradise the companions except those who believed and did the righteous, we said: Why is it not permissible for what is meant to be that they are the ones who deserve it It is preferred, and he did not enter this judgment, and God knows.
