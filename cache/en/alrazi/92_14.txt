The Quranic researcher (P-184) As for his saying, the Almighty is: We have the last and the first, and he is in his face: The first: that we have everything in the world and the hereafter, and it is not harmful to us.In our king, we will increase your king, but we will benefit from that and the righteousness of you, and if we will prevent you from the sins, as we have the world and the hereafter, and we will not be from this Because this direction is made by cost, but we will prevent you from the two and the norms, the promise and the return.The second: that we have the ownership of the two households, we give what we are creating from the creation, and the two households are required of us, and the first is the first one to say the dismissal, and the second is to say.As for the saying of the Exalted: I warn you a fire that does not reach it except Al -Ashrak, who lied and fell asleep.And from him the hell was called a fool, and then it is clear that it is for those who say it: only Al -Ashqi said: Ibn Abbas said: I came down in the illiterate of Bin Bin Khal Muhammad and the prophets before him, and it was said: Al -Ashraqi in the sense of the slander is as it is said: I have no one in it, that is, with a buddow, for the meaning does not enter it except the disbeliever, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And God, and he who is: He was subjected to obedience to God, and he knows that the recipient is holding this verse in that there is no Eid except for the infidels, the judge said: It appears, and it is indicated by three aspects: one of them is that it is necessary that the fire will not enter except the wise who lied and turned away, and it is obligatory in the infidel who is not.Enter the fire.And the second: that this is a seduction of sins; Because it is a house that God Almighty says to those who believed in God and His Messenger, and he did not lie and did not go beyond: that is, a disobedience that you have to do, and this is not harmful, and this is not harmful, and this is not harmful.Fire like pornography, and God Almighty is for that.And the third of it: that his saying is up to the Almighty: after and will be avoided by the righteousness, it is indicated by the blessing of this phenomenon because it is known from the state of the evildoer that it is not a good thing; Because that is an exaggeration in piety, and whoever committed the bones of the cabinet does not describe that he fears, then if the first is indicating that the evildoer does not enter the fire, then this is the second.The fire is avoided, and every cost does not avoid the fire, so it must be of its people, and when it was proven that it is necessary to be interpreted, then we say: in it: With his saying: a fire that thickens a special fire from fire; Because it is a larva of the Almighty saying: The hypocrites in the lower way of the fire [Women: 145] The verse indicates that that special fire does not reach it, and it is not related to this The evildoer and others of this description of the infidels does not enter the fire of the fire.The second: that what is meant by saying: a fire The fires are all, and it is intended to say it: only the righteous: this is more right to it, and this is the description of this leadership in the investigator other than that.Know that the judge's face is weak.As for his saying (first): It is necessary for this infidel that the fire does not enter, so his answers: that every disbeliever is inevitable and that it is a lie to the Prophet in his claim, Looking at the significance of the truth of that Prophet, so he will be believed that he is more difficult than the blind of the stick, and that he lied and turned up and if every disbeliever is inside the verse he said.As for his second saying: This is a deficiency of disobedience as well; Because it is sufficient in the dirt from the disobedience, the fact that the slander is made in the urgent and the arrival of the anger of God in the sense that it does not honor it and does not glorify it, and does not give it the reward, and it does not.Another, there was no evidence to the blockade of the anxiety in the insertion of the fire.(P-185) As for his saying, third: It will be avoided by the righteousness.Hold it with it?And that is confirmed that this requires that it does not take the entry of the fire; It is obligatory in the boys and the crazy to enter the fire and that is false.As for his saying, he said: What is meant by a special fire is a special fire, and it is the fire that is also weakened by weakness; Because his saying: a fire that is tightened to be a description of all fires, and that it is a row for a special light, but it is up to all the fire in all the fire Other, he said: It is not a conflict of the grill [Al -Maarij: 15].As for his saying: What is meant is that this is the right to it is weak because it is a leaving for the back of the other than a sign, so you have proven the weakness of the faces, which is the one who mentioned it About him, on your saying, so you do not cut the vastness and the feast of the immorality?Answer: From two voices: The first: What the one mentioned is that the meaning of it is: He does not pray it, and it is not obligatory in the truth of the language, it is said: The fire of the infidel is pray This binding is only proven to the disbelievers, but the evildoer is either he does not enter it or if it enters it, it is saved from it.The second: that the general public is specialized in the verses indicating the feast of immorality, and God knows best.
