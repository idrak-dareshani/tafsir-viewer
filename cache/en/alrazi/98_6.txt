The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: The people who disbelieved from the people of the book and the partners in the fire of hell are immortal in which these are the evil of the wilderness.His saying: It was not those who disbelieved from the people of the book and the participants, then he mentioned the state of the believers in his saying: And they did not command it to worship it (P-47) The remembrance of both the two parties, and he also started in the case of the disbelievers, so he said: Those who disbelieve and know that he was the highest of their conditions: They are the evil of creation, and we are asking: the first question: Why did the people of the book come to the partners in the remembrance?Answer: From his faces: one of them: He is the prayers and peace be upon him.My people, they do not know.The face of the image, and on the day of the beach on the face of the biography, which is the prayer, then it is the gun of it, and he said: He said: As you are offered my right to your right, then I will do you The right of my soul, so whoever leaves the prayer, the height of his life does not disbelieve and whoever stabbed in a hair from your poetry will disbelieve.If you know that, then we say: The people of the book were not stabbing in God, but rather in the Messenger, and as for the participants, they were stabbing in God, so when he wanted God, then he wanted to God They mention their bad condition at first in the nickname with the remembrance of those who stabbed in Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - and they are the people of the book, then secondly, with the remembrance of those who stabbed it.And the second: that the elders of the book of the book in the right of the Messenger - peace be upon him - were great; Because the participants saw him as a young and grew up between them, then he shed their dreams and their religion was invalid And they acknowledged with his conversation, and when they came to him, they denied it with knowledge of it, so their crime was more severe.The second question: Why did he mention: they disbelieve in the verb: and those who shared the name of the subject?And the answer: Alert it to the people of the book that they were not disbelievers from the first thing because they were believers with the victims and the evangelization, and they are coupled with the resurrection of Muhammad ﷺ After his resurrection - peace be upon him - with the disagreement of the partners, so they were born to the worship of the two and the denial of wise and resurrection.The third question: that the participants were denying the artists and denied the prophethood and denied the resurrection, but the people of the book were determined by all these things, but these things were not.Dispieces of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, so the infidelity of the people of the book was lighter than the disbelief The participants, and if it is like this, how is the settlement between the two parties in the torment?The answer: It is said: a well of hell if it is far from the bottom, as if it is an upper saying: You grow up asking for the failure, so they will be at the bottom of the sins, then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been They contradict their partnership in this destiny, their recession in the paths of torment, and know that the face is in goodness this torment that the abuse is on two sections: a misfortune to those who offended you and whoever offends you and who is offended to you The second division is the ugliness of the two divisions, and the charity is also on two sections: charity to those who are good to you, and goodness to those who offended you, and this is the best of the division, so the one is the best of the division, so the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is good for the two days The greatest of the types of charity, their misfortune and their disbelief are the ugliness of the types of misfortune, and it is known that the drug is only in the sense of criminality, so the insult is a condolence And with the stretching, and with the adultery, the killing is divided, but the likeness of the similar is required, and the view of the Messenger is required to be murdered.These infidels are the greatest of felonies, there is no crime that deserves the greatest of the punishment, and it is a fire (P-48) hell, for it is a fire in a deep, dark, dark, dark, and unjust As if he said: He gave it that there is no hope for the fools, so is there the hope of the perpetrators?And he said: No, but they remain immortal about it, then as if it was said: Is there anyone who cursed his heart on them?He said: No, but they vilify them, and they curse them because they are the evil of the wilderness.The fourth question: What is the reason for that he did not say here: eternal people ever, and he said in the description of the people of the reward: ever immortalized in it?The answer: from his faces: one of them: the alert is that his mercy is more than his anger.And the second: that the punishment, the limits, and the atonement are involved, while the reward is its sections, they do not interfere.And the third of it: it was narrated from God that he said: O David, love me to my creation, he said: How do I do that?He said: I remember them with my mercy, so this was from this door.The fifth question: How to read in the memorial of the wilderness?Answer: A recitation of the “wilderness” read with the prodigy, and the rest of the people have read, and it is one of the innocence of God, the creation, and the measurement in it is the prestige, except that it is left of his gossip, like the Prophet, And the prodigy in it is like returning to the origin that is left in the recovery, just as the one who assaulted the Prophet was like that, and the gambling is left in it, and if it is the prodigy, it is the same The consecutive is not.The prodigy of those who gave the wilderness indicate the corruption of the saying of those who said: It is from the righteousness who is the dust.The sixth question: What is the useful in his saying: They are the evil of the wilderness?The answer: It benefits the negation and the evidence, that is, they are without them, and know that the evil of the wilderness is a sentence that is separated by its separation, evil from the steel, because they were raised from them The Book of God is a righteous characteristic of Muhammad, and an evil of the stroke of the way, because they cut the way of the right to creation, and an evil of ignorance of the fools, because the old man It will be honest.Know that this alerts him that the feast of bad scholars is greater than the feast of every one.The seven question: This verse is it a cultivation of its general?Answer: No, but it is specialized with two pictures: one of them: that whoever repents of them and converted to come out of the return.The second: Some of them said: It is not permissible to enter into the verse who went from the infidels, because Pharaoh was evil from them, but the second verse, which is the verse of the meaning Played in the one who is presented and delayed, because they are the best of the nations.
