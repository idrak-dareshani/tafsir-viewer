The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And among the people who say that we believe in God and the last day and what they are in the believers, I know that the informants have gathered on the authority of the one who said: The three items of the believers, the infidels, and the hypocrites, so they began with the believers who were disturbed The righteousness of the residence on the pity and stubbornness, then described the condition of those who say with his tongue that he is a believer and his condolences to violate that, and in which there are questions: Hypocrisy is only evacuated with a division that we remember, so we say: The hearts of the heart are four, which is the metaphor of the metaphor that benefits from the evidence, which is the knowledge, and the knowledge, and the knowledge, The one who is used is not about the evidence, which is the belief of the imam, and the belief is other than the past, which is ignorant, and the heart of the heart is for all of that, so this is the sections of the four, and the one is four, Construction, denying, and silence, so that it will be completed by the twelve sections.The first type: If the karafs get the heart, then it is either that it will join it with the tongue or the denial of the tongue or the silence.The first section: If the Africans obtained the heart and the ritualization of the tongue, then this declaration, if it is a choice, then he is accompanied by a believer who is truly in agreement, and if it is a matter But he finds out of himself that if it were not fearful, he would not have appointed, but he denied it, so this must be considered an agreement; Because with his heart, it is a false denial, so if the tongue is a valuable determination, he must be considered an agreement; Because with his heart (P-54), a denying is denying the juvenile of declaration, the second oath: that the klavs will obtain the heart and the linguistic denial, so this denial, if it was the one who was a deny A Muslim, because of his words: Except: Except for whom he is dedicated and his heart is reassured by faith [bee: 106] and if he was a choice, he was an infidel disbeliever.The third division: that the karafs get the heart and the tongue will be free from the declaration and the denial, so this silence is either that it is a persecution or a choice, then if it is for you, then if it is for you He feared his remembrance of the tongue, so this is a true Muslim or as if God knew his evidence, then when the looks miserable, he died in a sudden, then this is a believer.Because he brought everything that he assigned to and did not find the time of justice and denial, then it was excused for it, and if it was a choice, then it is the same This is the place of searching, and the Mill of Al -Ghazali, may God have mercy on him, is that he is a believer for his saying, peace be upon him: The man whose heart is full of the light of faith, so how does it come out of the fire?.The second type: to obtain in the heart of the imitator, Either there is a declaration with him, the denial or silence: the first section: that the declaration is found with it, then that rejuvenation, if it is my choice, then this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is Is it a believer or not?And if it is obligatory, then this will be separated from the first image, then if we judge in the first image with disbelief, then we are not words, and if we judge there, we must be in faith.Because in this picture, if the heart was a disobedient, this person was an agreed one, so that it would be hypocritical when the imitation was the first.The second division: the imitated belief with the linguistic denial, then this denial, if it is a choice, then there is no doubt about the infidels, and if it is obligatory and judged by the faith of the faith With faith in this image.The third division: the imitated possibility with the silence, it is a disturbance, whether or not the rule, and its ruling is the ruling of the third section of the first type, if the first of us is.The third type: the heart denial, either it is found with it as linguistic declaration, the linguistic denial, or silence.The first section: that the linguistic declaration is found with it, then that is the declaration, if it is obligatory, then it is the hypocrite, and if it is a choice, then it is like that it is a good person who is a person who is a person who is a person.Then, with the choice, he acknowledged the tongue that the world is updated, and this is not followed; Because if it is permissible to know the heart and then deny the tongue, which is the disbelief of the ingratitude and the stubbornness, then why is it not permissible to be ignorant of the heart and then acknowledged?This section is also a hypocrisy.The second section: that the heart is found and the linguistic denial is found, so this is an infidel and not with hypocrites; Because he did not appear something with his interior.The third division: that the heart of the heart is found with the linguistic silence.Because it did not appear.The loyal type: the empty heart of all the struggles.The first section: If the declaration is found, then this declaration is either it is a choice or a persecution, then if it is a choice, then if it is the owner of the view, it is not the same.But he did what is not permissible as he informs what he does not know that he is true to him or not?And if it is not in the view of the view, then it is a look, but if it is obligatory, the owner did not atone; Because he stops him if he was in the way of looking and he was afraid of himself from the blessing of the justice, he was not his work.The second division: the empty heart with the denial of the tongue and its judgment on the opposite of the ruling of the tenth division.The third division: the empty heart with the empty tongue, then if it is in the time of the view, then that is the duty, and if it is outside the view of the view, it must be atone In the hypocrisy, this is the possible sections in this section, and it appeared from it that the hypocrisy is what it is, and that it is the one who does not apparent its appearance, whether it was in the interior of what was His interior is empty of what he feels for him, and if you know this, he appeared that his saying: (P-55) and from the people who say that we believe in God and the one who is the one who is the one who is the good Know.* * * The second question: they disagreed that the disbelief of the original infidel is more ugly, or the disbelief of the hypocrite?The people said: The disbelief of the original infidel is the most ugly; Because it is ignorant of the heart is a liar of the tongue, and the hypocrite is ignorant of the heart that is honest with the tongue, and others said, but the hypocrite is also a liar of the tongue, for it is the one who tells it, so it is the one who tells it, then it is a liar.That is the belief that it is not upon him, and for that he said: The Arabs said, “We have not said,“ You did not believe, but they said: “We have said: It is witnessed that the hypocrites are liars [the hypocrites: 1] Then the hypocrisy is concluded with the increasing things that are denied: one of them: that it is the intention of the confusion.And the second: that the infidel is on the ritual of men, and the argument on the plane of the knee.And the third of it: that the infidel is not satisfied with itself with lies, but it was sufficient for it and it was only satisfied with the honesty, and the hypocrite is satisfied with that.And the one that is the one that the argument was destroyed to its disbelief, mocking the disagreement of the original infidel, and for the sake of the thickness of its disbelief, the Almighty said: The hypocrites are in the righteousness of the ritual.[145] Fifth: Mujahid said: It is upset with the remembrance of the believers in the four verses, then he was praised by the remembrance of the infidels in two verses, and then the remembrance of the two of the people.This indicates that the argument is greater.This is far; Because the frequent of the elimination of their news does not require the being of their generosity is greater, if it is great, then it is so, and it is annexed to the disbelievers, and it is like it.And the clouds are required to be not, and it can be answered by it that the many of the elimination of their experiences indicate that the pacifier is the payment of the evil of the evil, That indicates that they are greater than the infidels.* * * The third question: This verse is indicative of two things: the first: that it indicates that those who do not know God Almighty and approved with him, for he will not be a believer.With the believers, the Karamiya said: It is a believer.The second: It is indicative of the saying of those who claim that all the costs are known to God, and whoever is not a disobedient is not in it, it is not a cost, but the first is the first If they were disobedient to God, and they had acknowledged it, it would have been that they would be in that faith; Because those who know God Almighty and recognize him must be believers and either The second is that it is not the best, even if it was excused for what God has died on the nursing of the kaver, so the saying of those who said from the one who speaks to the one who does not say: Sorry.* * * The following question: they mentioned in the detection of the person’s memorials: one of them: it is narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: He was called a human being; Because he was a pledge to him and forgotten, and the poet said: You called a human being because you are my people.And Abu al -Fattah al -Busiti said: “The most charitable people to the people ∗∗∗ and the most preferred people over the people.And the second: He was called a human being to deny it with the same.And the third of it: They said: The human being is called a human being for their appearance and that they forget, that is, they see from his say: For them.And know that it is not obligatory in every memorization that it is derived from something else, otherwise it is necessary to sit down, and on this, there is no need to make the human being who is not one.The fifth question: Ibn Abbas said: It was descended in the opponents of the people of the book, including Abdullah ibn Abi (P-56) and the son of Ibn Qashir The believers show faith and belief and say that we will find in our writers his obedience and description and they did not be like that if some of them are left.* * * The sixth question: the word “who” is a righteous memorizing for the trim, the collection, and the one.As for the one, the Almighty said: It is for those who listen to you [Al -Anam: 25] and in the collection as his saying: And among them are those who listen to you [Yunus: 42] The group of the meaning, when the neutralization is returned to the memorial, and when the group is returned to the meaning, and the two things are obtained in this verse; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: He says to the one who is memorized, and we believed in the memorization of collection and the rest of the verse remained questions.The first question: The hypocrites were believers in God and the last day, but they were denying that his prophets were upon him, peace be upon him.The last?.The answer: If we carry this verse on the opposite hypocrites, then there is no form; Because the most of them were ignorant of God and the denial of the mission and the mission, and if we carried it on the speakers of the people of the book and they are the Juda, then God lied to them; Because the faith of God in God is not faith; Because they imitated his body, and they said, the son of the son of God, and their faith on the last day is not faith, so when they said, we believed in God, he was a good thing.Because they were in their hearts, they believed in that false face, and with the tongue they delusion, Muslims are delusional with this words: We believe in God, for the same Him in it.The second question: How is his saying: What are the believers.They said: We believe in God and the first in the remembrance of the verb, not the perpetrator, and the second in the remembrance of the subject, not the verb?.The answer is that whoever said: So that so, he looked at the Islamic question, and if you said that he did not look at that question, you would have lied to him, but if he said: You have been overwhelmed in his denying it, meaning that it is not from this sex, so how do he think that?So, so when they said, “We believed in God, if God said,“ He did not believe in that, that was a lie to them.Its saying: They want to leave the fire and what they are out of it [Al -Ma’idah: 37] is the most informed of their saying: and what they come out of it.The third question: What is meant by the other day?The answer: It is permissible for him to have the time that has no limit and he is the permanent forever, which is not cut off for a long time, and it is permissible for him to be intended for the limited time until he is the one Paradise paradise, and the people of fire; Because he is the last of the limited fabrics, and after that, there is no limit to him.
