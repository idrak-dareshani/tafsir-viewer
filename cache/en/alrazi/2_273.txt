The researcher is the Almighty: The poor who are confined to the path of God are not able to strike in the land that the ignorant people are counted as the rich of the people who do not know.People are an argument and what they are spent for the best, for God is knowledgeable.Who is the most severe people with a shock to whom he is?He said: For the poor who are confined to the path of God and in the verse of the questions: the first question: the blame in his saying: the poor are attached to what?In it, it is the first: The many verses were presented in the urging of the spending, after which it was said to the poor, that is, that spending, which is insisted (P-70) A male of a man and says: a sane is a valleys, and the meaning is that that who passed through and his description is a sane for ab And Al -Daraym: Fan and two hundred hundred, that is, that who is in the sake of Fan and two hundred.The second: that the inclusion of the verse is baptized to the poor and make what you spend for the poor.The third: It is permissible for the beginning to be deleted, and appreciation: your charity to the poor.* * * The mosque, and they learn the Qur’an, and they fast and come out in every invasion, on the authority of Ibn Abbas: So he repented their hearts.And he knew that God is upholstered and described these paradoxes with five adjectives: the first characteristic: His saying: Those who confine themselves in the path of God [Al -Baqara: 273] He offers the man what is between him and his travels, from the disease, an enemy, or the goat, or what runs the course of these things, the man is said: It is limited, and the words went in the sense of the blockade when it said: If you are in conformity [the cow: 196] with what is eager to repeat, but the interpretation is lost, then this is the same.The numbers that are in the sense of blockade, the first: that the meaning: they confined themselves and standing on jihad, and that his saying: in the path of God, in the way of the sake of the Qur’an Jihad was obligatory in that time, and the pilgrim was tightened to those who love himself for the face with the Messenger ﷺ, so he will be prepared for that, when is the need These are the poor that they are in this description, and whoever is the same is the inclusion of charity in them.It is good for one of them, one of them: the removal of their hopes.The second: The strengthening of their heart is when they did not.And the third: the strengthening of Islam with the strengthening of the two.And he poured it: that they were very needed with the fact that they did not appear their need, on what the Almighty said: They are not able to strike in the land that the ignorant of the ignorance of the people.And the second saying: It is the saying of Qatada and Ibn Zaid: They prevented themselves from the fragments in the merchants of pension The city, and when they were killed and killed them.And the third saying: It is the saying of Said ibn al -Masib and the choice of Al -Kisa’i: that these people have become incentives with the Messenger of God ﷺ, and they have become a time On the ground in the land.And the righteous saying: Ibn Abbas said: These are the people of the immigrants, the poverty was seen by jihad in the path of God, so God excused them.And the fifth saying: These are people who were occupied with the remembrance of God, his obedience, and his servants, and the intensity of their abstraction in that obedience is from the obedience Important.The second line of the paragraphs: His exalted say: They do not be severely beaten in the land.They are preoccupied with religion and the matter of jihad, which prevents them from (P-71) to be forcibly forcibly and merchant It prevents them from it, and on all the faces, he does not doubt the intensity of their argument to those who are appointed to their tasks.The third row has: His Excellency said: The ignorant people are counted by the riches of abuser and in which there are questions: The Sunnah and those who break their brokenness and they are the one in one sense, and read in the Qur’an what was of the two al -Hasan in the two linguists all the conquest and the fracture, and the conquest of the time The past, if it was done, we have calculated, the harms were done, like a separation, separating and drinking, and he was calculated, and he calculated that he is already.The last, and the fracture is good for the coming of the hearing with it, even if it is anomalous about the measurement.The second question: Al -Hasban is the thought, and its saying: The ignorant was not wanted by the ignorance that is against the mind, but he wanted the ignorance, which is against the one who says: Their orders are tired of the riches of alienation, and it is an act of chastity and the meaning of chastity in the language.Rather, they are calculated by the riches of their appearances, and the neglect is left.The luxurious adjective of the paragraphs: His Excellency said: Know them with their peaceful and semi -name.The thing is known to it, and the origin of it is from the heavens that is the mark, the waw turned to the position of the eye, the one said: “It is a pardon, as they said: And a people said: The one is intended because it is a mark that was placed for the appearance.The whistle of their colors from hunger.Ibn Zaid said: The clinic of their clothes and hunger is hidden.And when all of that is a view that all that they mentioned signs indicating the cruise of poverty, and that is contradicted by his saying: the ignorance of the people will be rejected by them.The intended thing is that the worshipers of God are the sacrifice and a slope in the hearts of creation, everyone who saw them was affected by them and the humiliation of them, and that is not a person Jasmiyyah, not to see that if the lion passes, the sword is gone by his patronage, not by experiencing, because the phenomenon is that that is the time of what it was located, and the prodigy is from the ritual The weak, and all of these are spiritual and not generous perceptions, so we are here.Also the appearance of the effects of thought, it was narrated that they were at night to cure and be overwhelmed by the night to alienate.The fifth adjective of the paragraphs: His Exalted: They do not ask people to be angry about Ibn Masoud, may God be pleased with him: God loves the forgiveness The obscene, liquid, liquid, who is given a lot of excessive praise, and if a little is given in the vigor, and from the Messenger of God ﷺ: “ So God opened a chapter on him a poverty, and whoever seeks to sing God, and whoever hides, may God exalt, may God bless him He has to ask people.He knew that this verse is a problem, and they mentioned in its interpretation of its faces: the first: that the argument is the urgency and the meaning that they asked for a kind and not to be cursed.Weak, because God Almighty described them with the relief from (p-72) the question before that, and he said: The ignorance of the people count them from the defamation, and this is the same.The second: He is the one who was in Baboi when the writings of this impulsion: that it is not intended from his saying: They do not ask people to be a quilt and describe them that they do not ask.Because he was upholshed and described them before that, they are forgiven for the question, and if he knows that they do not ask the bit, then he also knew that they do not ask, but they are not asking, but the one who asks for the ritual The bad way who asks people is an argument, and his example, if you attend, have a man who is sane and a steadfast drain, and the other is a thunderbolt Suffice, if you want to praise one of them and be exposed to the defamation of the other Your saying does not go into the fools and fools and describe it with that, because what is presented from the good descriptions is rich in that, but your abuse is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same His saying: They do not ask people after his saying: The ignorant people are counted by the riches of the abundant abuse from it, and it is the one who asks for the one who asks for the one who asks the people of the people The two geniuses about the other in the convergence of praising and glorification.The third direction: that the armed man is the one who brings money as a lot of his kindness, so his saying is not able to be attempted, and he is a hardship, and if he is a custody, and if he is a custody, and if he is a custody, and if he is a custody, and if he is the one who is a custody, and if he is a custody, and if he is a hardship The question is on this face, so that it is not found on the face of the violence, then if the division is prohibited, then the question is forbidden, so this is the saying of it: Like the necessity of the breasts of the question originally.And the faster face: He is the one who has been in Balb for this time, and it is that he is clear when the intensity of the need of these poor is presented, and whoever wears it is not a need The question is left except with a severe urgency from it on its own, so they would not ask people, but they could leave the question when they were on the authority of the soul and the people of the soul.That is the question, and it is the saying of Omar ibn al -Khattab, may God be pleased with him: ؎ I am a soul that I say to it if it is attracted to me, because I am the one who is the one who is the one who is the fifth And that he urges some of the grooves, because if he asks, then he will be a water and his face, and he carries the humiliation in the shadow of that question, and he says: When this is borne, then this is not the same What is meant, for this kidney carries him on the edge and urgency, so she proves that everyone who asked, so it is necessary to be presented to the urgency in some of the hazards, so the righteousness of them, so the righteous Related to the negation of the question about them.The sixth direction: It is also a risk of Babes in this time, which is that whoever appears from himself the effects of poverty, humiliation and dwelling, then he was silent about the question.Al -Mamfaf, because the appearance of the emirates of the pilgrim indicates the need, and its silence indicates that he does not have what he is pushed with that pilgrimage, and when the person is perceived by the one who is the one who passes the person who is the one who is the one who is perceived by the person who is the one who visited the person of the person who is the same Very, and he became a carrier for him to pay anything to him, so the appearance of this case was the question on the path of the argument, so he said: They do not ask the people that they are the ones About the question, but they do not guarantee that silence from the heat of the situation and the emergence of the crushing of what the question of the question is based And they are inserted into this creation And they make their poverty and need them in terms of it only the Creator, for this face is also a reasonable reason There are many, and this three faces have been fulfilled by the success of God, and you wrote the interpretation of this verse, and God knows His existence.And know that he was the highest of the attributes of these poor, then he said after him and what they spend from the best, for God is knowledgeable, and he is the opposite of what he mentioned before this You spend from the best that will be fulfilled to you and you do not oppress and this is not in the matter of renovation, and in it and Jahan: one of them: that he is up to what he said: and what you are exacerbated is from the good of you The fulfillment of the reward is not underestimated and a shortage that can only be made by knowledge of the subject of work and the infection of its influential flaws in the investigation of the reward, not in the reward of the reward, not It is a scholar of the bonds of the business and its in its entirety.And the second face: It is that it is up to what he wanted to believe in the Muslim and the Dhimmi, he said: And what you spend is the best of the goodness of you, and that he will be fulfilled, not to reward it.This verse in believing in the poor who are described in this full descriptions, and this spending was the greatest of the agreements of the agreements, not the crime of what he said to what he said.And what they spend from the best, for God is knowledgeable, and he runs the course of if the great authority says to His servant who is improved Your obedience and the good of your servants, for this is the greatest of a spot, if he says to him: If your reward is and pray to you.
