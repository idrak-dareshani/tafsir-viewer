The researcher is the Almighty: Those who believe in the unseen and evaluate the prayer, and from what we have agreed upon, they know that there are questions: the first question: the one who said: They believe in either connected to those who are righteous, that it is a row of course, or a tendency or a prairist whispering with the ability of me, who is the one who believes, or those who believe, or those who believe, or those who believe, It is cut off from the righteous, who is broken on the one who has been informed of those who are in this way.It was completely stopped.* * * That is because the pious is the one who is an act of good and hidden for the facials, but the verb is either that the act of the heart is, and it is his saying: those who believe - and those who believe: The action of the wounds is the basis of prayer, zakat and charity; Because worship is either a minimum and the sake of prayer, or millions, and the sake of zakat; This is why the Messenger, peace be upon him, called: “Prayer is the Dean of Religion, and Zakat is the dots of Islam.[Al -Anakbout: 45] The closest is that these things are not interpreted to be eager; That is because the amount of happiness does not happen unless it does not leave what does not want and the action of what is empty, so the leaving is piety, and the verb is either the verb of the heart, which is the faith, or the faith, or the one who is the prayer, or the one who is the one who is the prayer And zakat, but the piety that is the blessing of the action that is faith, prayer and zakat, because the heart is like a softening that is the subject of the rituals of the truth, It must be purified first of the corrupt nest, so that the good niche can be proven in it, as well He is overwhelmed, then he mentioned after doing what he wants.* * * The third question: The owner of the scout said: Faith is a verb of security, then it is said: It is safe, if it is true, and his right (P-23) believes in the time I exceeded it with the casualty, so let him join him with the meaning of “Approved and recognized.Conduct and reassurance, and both of the two favors are good in believe in the unseen, that is, they know about it or trust that it is true.And I say: The people of the kiss differed in the name of faith in the knowledge of the law, and the group is collected by four.The first group: Those who said: Faith is a name for the acts of hearts, wounds, and acknowledgment of the tongue, and they are the disgraceful, the Kharijites, and the Zaydiyah, and the people of the hadith, and the people of the hadeeth, On the fact that faith in God wills the knowledge of God and all God did not put a mind or a sacred person from the book and the Sunnah, and the obedience of God is in all of what God has commanded from the verbs and the rituals of the rituals, and the rituals of the time.The collection of these things is faith, and leaves every summary of these qualities as disbelief, and the dispersed, and they agreed on that faith, if the faith is with the custodian Therefore, it is said: So that it is safe for God and His Messenger, and it is what is meant by believing, as faith in the sense of the performance of the obligations is in which there is no one in it, so that there is no: Pray and fast, but it is said: So that it believes in God, as it is said: He fasts and prayed to God, for faith infected with the strain is running on the way of the people They agreed on that it is transmitted from the linguistic name, which is the belief to another sense, then they disagreed with it on the faces: one of them: that the faith is a good one.It was a duty or a delegate, or from the chapter of sayings, verbs or arrests, and he is the saying of Wasl ibn Ata and the father of the Hudhal and the judge Abd al -Jabar ibn Ahmad.And secondly: It is a expressions of the act of obligatory And the third of it: that faith is a phrase for the seizure of everything in which the return came, so the believer has God all of those who have avoided all the cabinets, and the believer is for all of us The saying of the system, and from his companions who said: The condition of his being is a believer in us, and God is all the junction of all of them.As for the people of the hadeeth, they remembered and voices: the first: that the knowledge is a complete faith, which is the original, and then after that obedience is a faith on the same one, and this is the obedience that is no obedience, then there is no obedience, and there is no obedience, and there is no obedience, and there is no obedience, and there is no obedience, The arrangement of the original, which is known.And they claimed that the ingratitude and the denial of the heart are disbelievers, and then every disobedience after it is a disbelief on the same time, and they did not make anything of obedience to faith, and there is no faith, and there is nothing Infection, there are no unknown and denying, because the branch does not get the same as its origin, and it is the saying of Abdullah ibn Said ibn Kalb.The second: They claimed that faith is a name for all obstacles, and it is one faith, and they made the exhibits and the nawfil all of the sentence of faith, and whoever leaves something from the excesses, then it is not the same.His faith decreases, and among them is those who said: Faith is a name for the exhibits without the nawfil.The second division: Those who said: Faith in heart and tongue together, and these are different from the doctrine, the first: that faith is a declaration of the tongue, and the knowledge Hanifah and the general jurisprudence, then these they disappeared in two times, one of them: they disagreed with the truth of this definition, so whoever has the same Whether it was a condemnation, or was the knowledge of the evidence, and they are the most of those who judge that the imitator is a Muslim, and whoever is the one who is a person, who is the one The recipient.And secondly: They disagreed that the knowledgeable science is achieved by faith in what?Some of the speakers said: It is the knowledge of God and his descriptions on the path of completion and the fullness, and then it is when the creation of the creation in the attributes of God (p-24) On the atonement of those whom it has been exposed.And the people of Al -Isfaq said: The one who is considered the knowledge is all that is known as the harm, as it is from the debt of Muhammad ﷺ, so this is the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of it And by being visible or otherwise it is not inside the name of faith.The second saying: that faith is the belief in the heart and the tongue together, and it is the saying of Bashir ibn Ataba al -Marisi, and Abu al -Hasan al -Ash'ari, and the intention of the righteousness With the soul.The third saying: the saying of a group of Sufism: Faith is a declaration of the tongue, and a release of the heart.The third difference: Those who said: Faith is a wise man from the work of the heart only, and these are the ones who have disagreed with two sayings: one of them: the faith of the sake of God Even that those who knew God with his heart and then he fell with his tongue and died before he was approved by him, then he is a believer in full faith, and he said: As for the knowledge of the books, the messengers, and the last day, it was claimed that it is not within the limit of faith.Al -Kaabi recounted that faith is the knowledge of God with the knowledge of everything that was known as the harm, as it is from the religion of Muhammad.And secondly: that faith is a repetition of the heart, and it is the saying of Al -Husayn ibn al -Fadl al -Baghli.The fourth group: Those who said: Faith is the ritual of the tongue only, and they are two vehicles: the first: that the establishment of the tongue is the faith of the only one, but it is a condition In the heart, the definition is a condition for the formation of linguistics in faith, not that it is within the name of faith, and it is the saying of Ghillan ibn Muslim al -Damshaqi and the grace of the ritual He denied his saying to Gaylan.The second: that faith is the inventory of the ritual of the tongue, and it is the saying of the calamity, and they claimed that the hypocrite is the believer in the opponent of the disbeliever, so he has proven to him in The disbelievers in the last, this is the whole of the words of people in the name of faith in the knowledge of the law, and which we go to to it is that faith is a phrase of belief in the heart The explanation of what is the belief in the heart, so we say: Whoever says the world is an update, so the consequences of this are not the world of the world of the world, with the same That is the one who says the world is sharp, and the judgment is proven Research for the scientist is a stimulant for the confirmation of the creation of the world.Formulas and phrases with the costume of the mourning judgment is one thing that indicates that the cruel judgment is a matter that is a matter of this formula and the expressions, and because this is the same as this The judgment and the indication are not the same, then we say this is the true wisdom, other than knowledge, because the ignorance of the woman may judge him, so we know that this is the right of this For knowledge, what is meant by believing in the heart is this elderly judgment, so we are searching for a thicker, which is that the name of the belief in the ritual is that The formula indicates that the careful judgment, and achieve the saying in which we have mentioned it in the origins of jurisprudence.* * * If you know this present, then say: Faith is a refrigeration of belief in all that is known as the harm, as it is from the religion The proof of this gold to prove the four leaders: the first footnote: that faith is a phrase for believing, and it is indicated by his face The provision of the legs is not to believe that the one who speaks to it should be speaking, without the words of the Arabs, and that is to contradict the Qur’an.The second: that faith is the most righteous of the Muslim Sunnah, and if it became (P-25), it is transmitted to its original name, so that the references are available to the references, It was famous and reached to the limit of frequency, so when he did not know that he remained at the origin of the place.The third: We have gathered on the fact that the faithful faith in the perfection of the B is remaining at the origin of the language, so it is obligatory to be other than the one that is like that.The quarter: God Almighty is the more he mentioned faith in the Qur’an, added it to the heart, he said: Whoever said: We believed in their mouths and did not believe in their hearts: [41] Reassured with faith [Al -Nahleh: 106] The faith was written in their hearts [the argument: 22], but they say our Islam and when faith enters into your hearts [the watchers: 14] The faith mentioned the righteous deed with it, and if the righteous deed was inside the faith, then it was a crime.The sixth: that it is a lot of height that mentioned the faith and its part in the sins.Between them, if one of them is overwhelmed, then they would fight that you will be fulfilled to the command of God [the stone: 9] and the son of Abbas took on this: Believe in the killing [Al -Baqarah: 178] from three faces: one of them: that the penalty is It is obligatory for the deliberate killer, then he addressed him with his saying: O you who believed [Al -Baqara: 178], so he referred to that he is a believer.And the second: His saying: Whoever pardoned him from his brother is something [the cow: 178] and this brother is only the brotherhood of faith; To say to the Almighty: The believers are a brother [Al -Hijrat: 10].And the third of it: its saying: that is a relief from your Lord and the mercy [Al -Qar: 178] and this is only worthy of the believer, and what indicates the one who says: They abandoned [Anfal: 72] This remains the name of faith for those who did not abandon with the great bone in the lactity of the migration in the saying of the exalted [Al -Nahla: 28] And his saying: What you have from the state of them until something to be migrated [Anfal: 72] Safe, do not take my enemy and your enemy, the guardians [the conquered: 1] and he said: O you who believe, do not betray God and the Messenger and betray your trusts: [27] Those who believed, repent to God, a righteous repentance [Al -Taraim: 8] and the command of the repentance of those who have no guilt referred, and his saying: And they repent to God, which is all of them, which is all.This requires that every believer be a sinner, and so we say: He endowed that he specialized in the other hand, so he remained in them.The second footnote: that faith is not a phrase from the linguistic belief, and the evidence is upon him the saying of the Almighty: It is among the people who says: “We are in God and what are the people of God.” 8] He denied their believing in, and if faith in God was a expressive of the chances of the linguistic belief, this negation was correct.The third restriction: that faith is not a phrase for the divorce of believing, because whoever believes in the jabbat and the tyrant is not called a believer.The loyalist: It is not a condition of faith in conflict with all the attributes of God, glory and exalted; Because the Messenger - peace be upon him - was governing the faith of whoever did not take a world of his being a world of self or with knowledge, and if this was the one who is a matter Calculation of faith, when it is permissible for the Messenger to judge his faith before he is experiencing it that he knows that or not.This is the two words in the realization of faith, if he said: We are two pictures: the first image: whoever knows God Almighty with the evidence (P-26) and the proof, and the wilderness, and no The time and time is what is mentioned in the word of martyrdom, so it is our ruling that it is a believer, so you have gone through that the linguistic declaration is not in the faith, and it is not the same For consensus, and if you judge that it is not a believer, it is false; For him, peace be upon him: “He comes out of the fire who was in his heart.With faith, how is it not a believer?The second image: Whoever knows God is the Almighty, and he found from the time what I could have to speak to the word of martyrdom A violation of consensus, and if you say, it is not a believer, then it is false; For him, peace be upon him: “He comes out of the fire who was in his heart, the weight of an atom of faith.” The answer is that the gazelle is prevented from this consensus in the two images, and it is judged by their believers, and that the abstinence of the penetration is running the paths of the faith.The following question: It was said: “The unseen” is a source of the shrine of the name of the actor, such as the fast in the sense of the fasting person, and the visit in the sense of the visit Sayan: The first: It is the choice of my father, the Muslim Al -Asfi, that his saying: The unseen is the description of the believers, meaning that they believe in the state of God, as is the state Like the hypocrites that if they are found who believed, they said, “We believed in them, and if they were given to their thieves, they said: We are with you, but we are mocked.And his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: that is to know that I did not betray him in the unseen [Yusuf: 52] and the man says to others: For the believers, they are their appearances in agreement with their parties and their adornment for the state of the hypocrites who say that they are not in their mouths, and they are not in their mouths.The interpreters are gambling that the absence is the one who is absent from the sensual, then this absence is divided into what Dalil has, and what is not upon him.What is meant by this verse is the praise of those who are righteous that they believe in the unseen, which is evidenced by an indication that they think and infer, and they will be in.By God, the Exalted, with his descriptions and knowledge of the hereafter and the knowledge of the prophecy and the knowledge of the rulers and the parts, for the fact that this is the science of the scholars To be a reason for the great praise.And the father of a Muslim took over his saying with matters: the first: that his saying: Those who believe in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you and the last of them: With the absent things, if if it is intended from his saying: Those who believe in the unseen are the faith in the afflicted things that were not the kindness, the same as the same.The second: If we had the belief in the faith, the release of the saying is necessary that the human being knows the unseen, and it is the disagreement of the saying of the Almighty: and it is not the same: 59] As for if we were pleased with what we said, this warning is not necessary.The third: The unseen is permissible, but it is permissible to release it on the one who is permissible to attend, so on This is not permissible to release the absenteeism of the same of God Almighty and his attributes, so his saying: Those who believe in the unseen, even if the faith is from the faith, then the faith is the one who is in the faith of the faith.His attributes and his attributes, and there is only faith in the hereafter, and that is not permissible; Because the great population in faith is faith in the same and his attributes, how is the sake of the sake of the memorial to the one that requires the essence of the origin, but if it is the same We did not have this warning.The answer to the first: that his saying: they believe in the unseen, faith in the absentees of the crumbs, then after that, he said: and those who believe in what you believe Before you [the cow: 4] faith will be in charge [Al-Baqara: 98] And on the authority of Al-Thani: that there is no conflict in that we believe in the absent things from us, so that specialization was necessary (P-27) the two.If it was said: They are said: The servant knows the unseen or not?We said: We have indicated that the absence is divided into what is indicated by an indication and what is not indicative of it, but the one who is not indicated by it is the grace of it, and it is not upon him, and the scholar is not.An evidence, so it is not forbidden to say: We know from the absence what we have a sign, and the words are beneficial, so it does not confuse, and on this face, the scholars said: One of the sides of the evidence.And on the third: We do not surrender that the memorization of the absence is used only as it is permissible for him to be present, and evidence is that the one who speaks is to say this from the door of this With the witness.And they want to be absent, with God, His attributes, and God knows.* * * (Fifth question): Some Shiites said: What is meant by the condolences is the waiting for the one who is the one who has been transcended by the Qur’an and the Qur’an, and the Qur’an is the one who said: They believed from you and do the righteous, so that they will be used in the land, as it was used as those before them [Al -Nur: 55].As for the news, he said to him: The world is only one day, the long day of that day, until a man from the people of my house comes out.As she was full of a wilderness and an injustice, “and know that the divorced one is given to the evidence.* * * (The sixth question): Remember the interpretation of the prayer of prayer and faces: one of it: that its residency is a phrase for the elimination of its pillars and its memorization that it is in the case And its etiquette, from: He established the oud, if he established it.And secondly: It is a phrase for the perpetrator of it, as he said: And those who are on their prayers are preserved [Al -Ma’agh: 34] and he said: Those who are on their prayers are always permanently [Al -Mawaghouj: 23] From: The market rose, if it agreed, and its hypocrisy resided; Because if it is preserved on it, it would be like a hypocritical thing that turns to it, and if it is lost, it is like the bad thing that is not desired by it, Requiring its performance, and that it is not in its performers of their saying: He did the matter, and the war rose up on its legs, and against it: it was forbidden, and it is a matter And firm.And its sequence: I stayed for her performance, but rather expressed performance with residence; Because the ruling is some of its pillars, as it crossed it with vocal, rak'ah and in the prostration, and they said: He praised if he prayed, because the supply of praise is in it, he said: Praise [Al -Safaat: 143] and know that the first is to carry the words on what he gets with him from the great praise, and that is not obtained unless we carry the residence on the perpetuation Its pillars and parties; Therefore, the value of the soldiers is described, but it is described as a valuable if it is given the rights without underestimation and deficiency; This is why God Almighty describes the existing and valuable; Because it is always obligatory; Because it perpetuates the impartiality of the sustenance over his worshipers.* * * (The swallowing question): They mentioned in the words of the prayer in the origin of the language, and it is a face: one of it: that the supplication said the poet: ؎ and the wind will blame it in its debt and pray on it.Al -Kharzanji: I derive it from the prayer, which is the fire, from their saying: I prayed the stick if I established it with the prayer The wood is strengthened by its presentation on the fire.And the third of it: that prayer is a expressive of the mandate from the saying of the Almighty: He prays a protective fire [Al -Ghashiya: 4] He will pray a fire with a flame [Al -Masad: 3] and the name of the Persians is called.And its booster: The owner of the scouts said: The prayer is an act of “prayers” like zakat from “Zaki” and I wrote it with wow on the memorial of the fool, and the righteousness The worshiper does that in his kneeling and prostration, and it was said to the supplicant a prayer that he likened to him in his fear of the pillar and the prostration, and I say: “We are the first The derivative that the owner of the scout mentioned leads to a great stab in the vicinity of the Qur’an with Hajj, and that is because the prayer is one of the most severe and most popular prayer The Sunnah of the Muslims, and derives it from the sake of the two prayers from the distance of the things, as it is among the people He is hidden and tied until he became in terms of his knowledge only, if he was like him in the path of the righteous, and if we have come to us, then what he said is that we have been brought to us.The conservation of what our understanding is dispersed to us from our time, so that it was in time The Messenger is a place for another suffering, and the intended of God was the highest of those suffering, except that the suffering was hidden in our time and it was exhausted, as it was like it When that was void with the gathering of Muslims, we taught us that the derived, which was mentioned by the oppression of falsehood.The second: Praying in the law is a expressions of special actions that recite some of the openness of the prohibition, disturbed by the solution, and this is the same.But what is intended for this is the subjective verse in particular; Because he is the one who stands on him; Because he is “peace be upon him, when the Arabs showed the row of the prayer of the present.* * * (The eighth question): The sustenance in the words of the Arabs is the luck.Special for him without otherwise, then some of them said: The sustenance is every thing that is eaten or used, and it is false, because God Almighty commanded that we spend what we have agreed, and he said: We were the one who is the hypocrites: 10], and if the sustenance was the one who eaten it, it could be spent.Others said: The sustenance is what he possesses, and it is also false, because the human being may say: Oh God, give me a good boy, or a righteous wife, and he does not possess the father, and he does not have the father Oh God, give me a mind that I live in, and the mind is not with your hearts, and also the dignity will have a livelihood, and there is no kingdom.As for the first time, they have disappeared in it, and Abu al -Husayn al -Basri said: The sustenance is the domination of the animal from the benefit of the one who is the one who is from it Including it, then if we say: God has given us the Almighty, so that it means that it has enabled us to intend for it, and if we ask us to give us the money, then we will give us money He makes us more special, and if we ask him to give the dahme, then we intend for that to make it more special, but you will be more than it, and it is more than it, and it is more than it.One can prevent her from his integrity with it, and know that the disgraceful when they were pleased with the sustenance with that, they are not a crime, they said: The forbidden is not a livelihood.Our companions said: The forbidden may be a livelihood, the Hajj of the companions is from two faces.The first: that the sustenance is in the origin of the language is the luck and the share on what it has shown, so whoever benefits from the forbidden, then that forbidden has become a luck and a share, so it is obligatory to be.The second: It is upset: He said: There is no tabbar in the land except for God, his sustenance [Hood: 6] And a man may live the height of his life, and he only eats His age did not eat anything from his livelihood.As for the disgraced, they took the book, Sunnah and the meaning.As for the book, it is a man: one of it is its saying (P-29), the Almighty: From what we have been exhausted, they will praise them on spending from what God has gave them up, and if only if he was the one who has been.They deserve the praise if they spend from the forbidden, and that is void with the agreement.And secondly: If the forbidden was a livelihood, it would be done that the usurper would spend from it, and it would have said to him: and woke up from what we have given you [the arguments: 10] and the gathering For the sake of what he took, but his response is obligatory for him, so he indicated that the forbidden is not a livelihood.And the third of it: His Excellency said: Say: Do you see what God has revealed to you from the livelihood, and you made it a forbidden and permissible.Fatel over God, and it has proven that the forbidden is not a livelihood, but the Sunnah, what was narrated by the father of Al -Husayn in the book of deception with his chain of chain of chain of chain.The Messenger of God ﷺ when Amr ibn Qarah came to him, so he said to him: O Messenger of God, God has written on me the hardship, so do not see me, but I will be blessed, He was obscene, so peace be upon him: “There is no time for you, no dignity, and no grace, you have lied to any of God’s enemy.What God has permitted for you is from his permissibility, but if you said after this present, something that struck you with a beating and heavily.He commanded others to prevent him from his integrity with him, and whoever is forbidden to take something and his integrity with it is not said that he has given him to him, do not you see that it is not said: the authority of the authority is the authority of the authority He prevented them from taking it, but it is said: He gave them what enabled them to take it, and does not prevent them from it, and it is not a matter of preventing them from it, he answered our companions from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was from the one who was the one who has been from the good But it is as it is said: O creator of the events, the throne, and the chair, and it is not said: O creator of dogs and swine, and he said: A eyes will drink with the servants of God, [6] The infidels were also from worshipers, as well as the name of the livelihood of the permissibility on the way of supervision, and if the forbidden is a livelihood, and they answered from the time of you Because he said to him, peace be upon him: “So you have seen what God forbade you from his livelihood.” The language, which is that the forbidden is he called a livelihood or not?There is no field for mental evidence in the province, and God knows.* * * (The ninth question): The origin of spending is the money of money from the hand, and the one who agreed with the sale is a hypocris The mouse because it is It comes out of it and the hypocrisy in its words, the Almighty: that you seek an tunnel in the land [Al -Anam: 35].(Al -Masalah Al -Ashira): In his saying: From what we lived in, they spend the benefits: one of them: he entered from Al -Tabadiya as a manner of them, and stopped from the one.And the second: the verb offered a sign of the most important of it, as if he said: They specialize in some money by believing it.And the third: it enters the spending removed in the verse, the obligatory spending, the delegated spending, and the obligatory spending is the sections: one of them: zakat and it is its saying in the verse of the treasure: and does not spend it in the verse of the treasure: [Table: 34].And the second: spending on the soul and on those who must spend it.And the third: spending in jihad.As for the tunnels, it is also spending; For his saying: And spend from what we have given you before one of you came to the death [Al -Muafiqin: 10] and he wanted the charity to his saying after him: The righteous [the arguments: 10] all of these agreements within the verse are because all of that is due to the investigation of the praise.
