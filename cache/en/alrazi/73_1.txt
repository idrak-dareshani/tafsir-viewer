prophet, peace be upon him, and the origin of the man who is tired of the vain, which is boring with his clothes, that is, he wrapped it with it, so he tweeted in the The developed in the affected, and they disagreed with why it is tasted with his garment?On Wajah: One of them: Ibn Abbas said: The first thing that Gabriel came upon him, peace be upon him, and he thought that he had a touch of heaven, so he returned from the mountains, and he said: Jabriel came and called him, and said: O, the bound.And the second: Al -Kalbi said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, was borne in his clothes to end the prayer, which is the choice of the deceased.And the third of it: He was peace be upon him, as a wicked man, who is in a cotton man, so he dedicated me to what is the case of that situation With the slaves.And he paired it: He was torn apart in a mast of the cheeks, insulted by it, so he said to him: Oh, the binding of the night, as if it was said: With the slaves.Fifth: Akarmah said: O you who have become a great matter, that is, his pregnancy, and the adornment of the pregnancy, and its inclusion.The second question: Reading the honor (Al -Muzammal and Al -Mudhroud) by relieving the zai and the signifier and tightening the mim and the abundance of the name is an effective or an act of it.The active is deleted, and the federation, O man, is the same as its soul, the same thing is its soul, and the act of the verb in the same way is like this.[Al -Nammel: 23] That is, you have given anything from anything, and if it was the name of the verb, it was that because he was decorated with his soul or his domination of it, and the one who has been.And the Almighty said: The night has two questions: (P-152) The first question: Ibn Abbas said: The night was a satisfaction with the Messenger of God: And the appearance of the matter for the jujub, then it was copied, and they differed in the causes of copying on the faces: the first: that it was an abuse before the prayers were imposed in the fifth.And secondly: He is upset when he said: The night is only a few or a few or a little from it.The whole night is afraid that the required destiny will not be preserved, and they were created for them until they were threw up and their feet and their markets were threw Read what you are pleased with [Al -Muzammal: 20] and that is in the chest of Islam, then Ibn Abbas said: He was among the first of this positive and between his copies of the year, and he said in this year, and he said: It was with a king and its copy In the city, then we copied this destiny as well with the five prayers, and the difference between this saying and between the first saying that in this saying, we are transcribed by Read what is easy from the Qur’an and then copy this with the affirmation of the prayers, and in the first saying we copy the positive of the abandonment with the affirmation of the five prayers, and he said: It was a little obligatory, and the evidence is upon him, the first: the first: his saying: From the night, then he will be abandoned with it, which is forbidden for you [Al -Asra: 79] So he explained that the abuse is not.Abbasid that the meaning is the increase in you.And the second: that the glorification even if it was obligatory on the Messenger, it was obligatory for his nation, for his saying: (and follow him) [Al -Arif: 158] and the roses of the copy.And the third: He is obligatory, and this is weak because it is not distant in the mind to say: I have to do the night to you, so it is his ability to do the few Those who say that the boundary of the obligatory answered, they answered the holding of his saying: The night is the night and said: Because we have seen the commandments of God, the Exalted, which will benefit the scarf and an alarm that benefits the positive, so it is necessary to make it useful for the blessed destiny between the two pictures, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is bound by the two pictures, Unless the verb’s side shall be on the side of the blessing, but the perpetrator of the blessing, it is steadfast in the context of the original, so when the righteous obtained the matter of the matter and the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the
