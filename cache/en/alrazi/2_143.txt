The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of it: And also we made you a nation and a simplicity to be a testimony of people, and the Messenger will be a martyr on you.“Likewise,” is enough to liken it, and what is like it?And in it is a face: one of them: that he returned to the meaning of guidance, that is, as we have been blessed with you with guidance, as well as we have blessed you to make you a nation.And the second: the saying of my father, a Muslim who reports, as we guided you to a kiss, which is the middle of the kiss, and so we made you a nation and simplicity.And the third of it: that it is domesticated to what was presented from his saying in the right of Abraham, peace be upon him: and we have chosen it in the world [the cow: 130], that is, so we have been involved in us.A nation and a simplicity.And its booster: it is for me to be the estimation: the righteous and the Maghrib, so these flaws after their equality in its place of the king of God, the king of God, and the king of God The supervision and the honor to make it a virtue of it and charity, so the servants of all of them are shared in the servants, except that this is the authority of this mother From it and charity, not a meal.Fifth: He may mention the guarantee of the thing, and if the host is not mentioned if the host is well known as the saying of the exalted: I am the Almighty: Then one of the well -known well -known at every one is that he is the one who is able to support those who want and humiliates those who want, so he said: So, he made you any of the good One of him is able to make you a nation.The second question: Know that if the medium is a name, you moved the medium as his saying: a nation and a simplicity, and the definition is light, you say: The interpretation of the medium and mentioned things.One of them: that the mediator is the justice (P-89) and the evidence is upon him the verse, the news, the poetry, the transmission, and the meaning, but the verse is the saying of the Almighty: He said: Al -Qafil narrated on the authority of Al -Thawri on the authority of Abu Saeed Al -Khudayri on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ: The prophet ﷺ was a relative of the Quraysh.And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “You have the middle pattern.Al -Jawhari said in “Al -Sahah”: And we have made you a nation and a simplicity, that is, just as it is the one who said the fear and the successor, and a dirt, and the meaning is that it is: The distance is from the two parties, and there is no doubt that the two parties of excess and spin are narrated, so the intermediate in the ethical is far from the two parties, so it was virtuous.And the second: Rather, the justice was called and a simplicity It is not inclined to one of the two characteristics, and justice is the aggressor who does not tend to one of the two parties.And the third of it: There is no doubt that what is meant by its saying: Likewise, we made you a nation and a simplicity of praise for them because it is not permissible to remember God, and it is like that He witnessed to him, then he will be overwhelmed by the testimony of the Messenger, except for that praise, so you have proven that what is meant by saying it is: and it is related to the praise, and there is no one in the door of the The witnesses are the case of their ruling on them in their formation, except for their formation, so they must be the same.And its elevation: that the bare of the bush and its righteousness, because its ruling is with a walk of his parts on both and on the same When it was correct in the middle, it became as if it was a phrase from the aggressor who is not inclined to a side without one side.The second saying: that the mediator is from everything his choice, they said: This interpretation is more important than the first to Wajah: The first: that the mediator is used in the authority of the one who said: A sentence from my Arabs with the Mecca of Hajj and said: He gave me a custody of a humiliation that wanted from the choice of drains and describing the elevation that is not found in the complications, so this is the interpretation.The second: It is a pursuit of the saying of the Almighty: You were the best of a nation that was brought out to people [Al -Amran: 110].The third saying: that if a man says: So, we are a lineage, then the meaning is that it is more virtuous, and this is a simplicity in the middle of the hearts, and the origin of this is that the one is the one who is And their stretching and they are around it, and it is a ritual and a simplicity of this meaning.The fourth saying: It is permissible to be a simplicity in the sense that they are interrupted in religion between the abandoned, the excessive, the majority and the palace in the things because they did not So they made a son and God, and they did not limit the default of Jews in killing the prophets, and the books of the books, and other than that they were short.And know that these sayings are close to incompatible, and God knows.* * * The third question: The companions took this verse that the servant’s action is created for God Almighty, because this verse indicates that this is the same.By making God and his creation, and this is a sweeping in the gold, the disgraced said: What is meant by this is the one who does the kindness that God has known to God, so that he will be the one who does not do so.When it is right in saying and doing, the companions answered from him from his face Carrying the verse on its appearance, but we have shown us that the dazzling mental evidence is only with us, the maximum of what is disgraced in this chapter is the one who is good Punishment, and We have a lot that this way is contradictory to their origins with the question of knowledge and the question of the preacher, and the exhibited words, not the lords of the time.The second face: that he said before this verse: He guides whoever is brought to a straight path, and he has shown the significance of this verse on our saying that he said that he is the same Without some, this verse must be prepared on that so that every one of them is confirmed by the other guarantees.The third face: that everything in the place of God is up to the righteousness in the right of all, then he did it, and if it was not, it would not have been for the sake of the believers.The Fast face: It is that God is the Almighty mentioned in the presentation of the generalization of this nation and the act of kindness and the duty and the duty is not permissible to mention it.* * * The loyal question: the crowd of the companions was brought up and the dismissed of this verse is that the nation’s gathering is a pilgrimage, so they said: The news of God is from God The best of them, so if they resided on something of the prohibitions, they would not be described as good.If it is said: The verse is the most dominant, because the nation has described the same, it requires the equity of each one of them with it and the difference of that is known to the harm, so there is no one, so there is no So we carry it on the infallible imams, we greeted us that it is not the abundance Disputing in Jahin: The first: that the man is a phrase for the performance of the obligations and the abstinence of the forbidden women, and this is from the act of the servant and the news of God has made it to make it.And a simplicity of the verb of God, and that requires that their being and simplicity are not as long as they are numbers, otherwise it is necessary to fall into a place and one of them.The second: The mediator is a name for what is in the middle of the two things, so he made it a truth in the equivalent and the goodness requires the purpose of the aspiration, which is the disagreement of the original But it is not enough in the obtaining of this description of the cultivation of the cousins, then, and if it is like that, it is carried that the one who gathered it on it, and if it was wrong, then it is for the sake of it.This is presented in their goodness, and from this involvement that it is the highest judgment of their being, so that they will be a lust for the people and the people of the people who are not.The testimony, we greeted them from the listeners and the lords, but God Almighty showed that their fairness with that was only for their formation It is achieved in the hereafter, so it is obligatory to achieve their equivalent there is that there is the equivalent of witnesses, but it is considered The state of performance is not the case of bearing, and that is not a dispute in it, because the nation is informing in the last, so did you say that they are in this world like that?We gave us the same as a domain in the world, but those who address this speech are those who were used when we have come to this one of the words of this There is a referred, and if this is the same, it is the same as those who were the ones who were in that time and do not require the equivalent of others.The consensus of these is a right, so we must not hold on to consensus unless we know that the saying of all of you is in it, but that is not possible for you to know The two people with their tenderness and our knowledge of the meeting of each one of them until after the death of Muhammad ﷺ and our knowledge of their sayings with their families in that consensus, and what was not like that Consulting consensus.(P-91) The answer to his saying: The verse is the phenomenon His meeting with his other hand, and when they are in every matter, they gathered on it, for each one of them is just in that matter.They do the cubic, but we said: This is a speech with the state of meeting; Because he said: He made us a speech for their group, not for each one of them alone, on the authority of me, and if we gave us that this requires that every one of them, we have no one of them.Doing it in the right of some for a sign that he rose up, so he must do a work with him in the right of the rest, and this is the meaning of what the scholars said: It is not the intention of the verse that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not It must be found among them among those who are in this row, so if we do not know with their insignificance, we will be brought up to the fulfillment of their groups on the authority of the saying Those who are considered in their sentences, for example: that the Messenger - peace and blessings be upon him - if he said: One of the children of so and so is that it is a misfortune in the opinion and the opinion We know him with his eyes and find his children, gathering on my opinion, and we know it really; Because it is inevitable and that the right is found in that, but if they gathered only one on my opinion, we did not really have it.Let it be the right to be with that one who is afraid, and for this he said many of the scholars: If we have balanced us in the nation who was a sinful person who was a mistake, he was a mistake that was a mistake.In the saying of the misfortune, we did not consider the atrocity by saying the mistake.His saying: If what was meant was from their being and a simplicity is what is meant by their justice, it was necessary to be the act of the servant as a creation of God Almighty: Bayan.His saying: Why did you say: The news of God is exalted for their justice And their best, it requires their seizure of the listening?We said: God is the highest of truthfulness, and the sincere news requires that the informant about it, and the work of the small is not good, so the group is between them, On the authority of the person, it is better than the best of the news that it is better in all things, or in some things It will be better in some things without some or in all matters, and the uniqueness of the division is partner between the two divisions, so whoever is better than the one who is a good one It is better, so the news of God Almighty is about the goodness of the nation that does not require his informing of their goodness in all matters, so you have proven that this does not contradict them.The listening, and we have been supported by this significance in the origins of jurisprudence, except that this question is and is answered to it, but the other question was answered by us.A nation and a rhetoric for the whole nation, the first and the last of it, whoever is from them is equipped and then we will go down this verse, and whoever comes after them until the time of the hour, as is the one who says: Al -Qasab [Al -Baqarah: 178], the fasting has been written for you [Al -Baqarah: 183] all of them are gone, and he does not specialize in the guidance in that time, and so is the path of God, and the people of God For the whole of the nation, if it was said: If the matter was like that, this was a speech for all who are found until the time For the people of every era in the event until you made them a pilgrimage to those after them?We said: Because he was exalted when he made them a testimony on people, and if he expressed the first nation and the last of it in its entirety in its place, it is a pilgrimage to it, for the other After its spending, the nation is a pilgrimage to it, so we knew that what is meant by the people of every era, and it is permissible to name the people of the one who is the mother of the mother For the group that leads one side, and there is no doubt that the people of every era like that, and because it is the highest, he said: a nation and a simplicity, and he expressed them with the words Every era.* * * Fifth question: People have disagreed that the testimony is mentioned in his words, the Almighty: to be a testimony on the people (P-92), it will be obtained in the last or in the last.The first saying: It falls into the hereafter, and those who are grateful to this saying are their goodness.The first: He is the one who is the most of them: that this nation testifies to the prophets on their nations who deny them, narrated that the nations are unjust So God calls for the Almighty to show the evidence that they have been informed and he knows, so he will come to the nation of Muhammad Did you know?So they say: Our knowledge of God Almighty in his book, the Sufficient on the Song of his Single Prophet So he shared them and testifies to their equivalent, and that is his saying: How if we come from every nation with a martyr and we have come to you on this one of the martyrs of the woman: [41] The narration is from its faces: its first: that the path of this narration is about that the nations lie to their prophets, and this is based on the fact that the people of the resurrection may be lied to, and this is a false We will speak to this question in the Surah of Anam in the interpretation of his words, the Almighty: Then they did not have a fantasy except that they said, and God, our Lord, did not see that we are not.They lied to themselves [Al-Anam: 23-24].And the second: that the nation’s testimony and the martyrdom of the Messenger are rested in the hereafter to the testimony of God Almighty on the truth of the prophet, and if it is so, then he did not see God?And his answer: The rule in that is the nation of Muhammad ﷺ in the best of the path of the nations by the initiative to the belief of God, the Almighty, and the truth of all the faith, With the lineage to the path of the nations, such as justice by the lineage, to the immoral, so God accepts their martyrs on the path of the nations, and he does not accept the martyrdom And a revelation of their virtues and their vengeance.And the third of it: that the example of this news is not called testimony, and this is weak; For his saying - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -: “If you know the same as the sun, then witness“ and the thing that God has informed of the Almighty, then it is the same as the same To him.The second face: They said the meaning of the verse: Let them testify to people with their countries that they are afraid of the truth in it, Ibn Zaid said: The martyrs are four: the first: the first: the first: the first: Works of worshipers.He said: Every soul came with it, a driver and a martyr [Q: 21] and he said: What is said of a saying except that he has a steadfast nickname [Q: 18] and he said: And if you have a hafi You know what you do [Al-Anfit: 10-12].And the second: the testimony of the prophets, which is what is meant by his saying, was narrated from Jesus - peace be upon him -: I was a martyr on them.On everything is a martyr, and he said in the right of Muhammad ﷺ and his nation in this verse: to be a testimony of people and the Messenger is upon you a martyr, and he said: With a testimony, and we came to you on these martyrs [Women: 41].And the third of it: the testimony of the nation of Muhammad is a special, he said: He came with the prophets and the martyrs [Al -Zumar: 69] and the Almighty said: And the day the martyrs will be established [Ghafir: 51].And the one who has been: the testimony of the wounds, which is the house [Al -Nur: 24] The verse, and he said: Today we are sealed with their mouths [Yass: 65] the verse.The second saying: that the performance of this testimony is in the world, and its report is that the testimony, the testimony and the witnesses are (P-93) the vision, it is said: I witnessed it, if it is like that, if it is like that, if it is like that, if it is like that, if it is like that, if it is like that, if it is like that.Between the eyes of the eyes and between the known of the heart, a severe occasional occasional that may not be called the knowledge that is in the heart: a witness and a witness, and the shame, and the knowledge Then the significance was named after the thing: a witness to the thing because it is the one with which the witness became a witness, and when the expert was about the thing and the one who is clear to the one That was called by that expert as well as a witness, then he concluded this memorizer in the knowledge of the legitimacy of those who tell the people of the people with a specialty, for a special You know this and say: Everyone who knows something and revealed about him was a witness to him, and God Almighty described this nation with the testimony of the testimony, and this is the testimony of this Or in the world, it is not permissible to be in the hereafter; Because God Almighty has made them a nominal in the world for the sake of being a testimony, and that is required that they be a testimony in the world, but we said: It is the Almighty; Because he was upset, he said: And we have made you a nation, and this is a news about the past, so no less than his obtaining it immediately, but we said: that is required for their goodness in the world; Because he said: He also made you a nation and a simplicity to be a testimony on the people, arranging their clarity on their goodness, and the rituals of the part He obtained the description of their being and a simplicity in the world, and it must be obtained and described as a testimony in the world.It may be called a witness, even if the performance is only in resurrection.We said: The witnessed testimony in the verse is not tolerance, with the evidence that it is the transgression of the equivalent in this testimony, and the testimony in which the elevation is considered, the performance is not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance, not the performance.It requires the mother of the nation to perform the testimony in the Dar Al -Dunya, and that requires that the group of the nation be if they are told about something that it is the saying of their saying Our saying: The consensus is a pilgrimage except this, so it has proven that the verse indicates that the consensus is an argument from this face as well, and I know that the evidence that he mentioned is the one who mentioned this The first two sayings are invalidated because we have shown this sign that the nation must be witnesses in this world, and this does not contradict their aspects of the rituals And the news returned with it, so it is the one who said that it is the Almighty: to be a testimony on the people indicating that they said about them at the gathering of a pilgrimage from where they say: The consensus shows the right of the right, and that is confirmed by the Almighty saying: The Messenger is a martyr on you, meaning a performer and a clear, then it is not forbidden The testimony in the hereafter, so the location of them will run in the world, the process of lowering; Because if they prove the truth, they know who has the capabilities and from the radio, then they will testify that on the Day of Resurrection, as the witness to the steriles, what is the same Then he testifies that with the ruler.The sixth question: the verse indicated that the one who has disbelieved and his immorality appeared, the likeness of the likeness, the outskirts, and the opponent, then it is not accustomed to it in the collection; Because God is exalted, but he made the martyrs of those who described them with the fullness and goodness, and it is not different in that judgment who is immoral or disbelieved with a saying or a person, or a good, By following.The following question: Rather, he said: He is a testimony to people and did not say: Because their saying requires the depression either by saying, or by verb, and that is upon him, not for him at once, if it was said: Why was the prayer of the testimony of the first and the first of the testimony?We said; Because the abuse in the first is to prove their martyrs to the nations, and in the other one who is the one who is the one who is a witness to them.* * His Excellency said: And what made us the kiss that you were on, except to know whoever follows the Messenger from those who turn to his two hurricanes, even if it is for him, and if it is for him God, and God would not have lost your faith.Know that it was said: What made us with it is what we have seen, and we did not judge him as saying: What God made from the lake [Al -Ma’idah: 103], meaning: what he did and did not make it a debt, and he said: You were lying to her future, as the saying of the saying: It was so -and -so in a debt, and he said: You were not in a description of the kiss, but it is a second, He wants: We did not make the kiss that you were on.Then here and Jahan: The first: that this speech be a biar for the rule in making the kiss, and that is because - upon him - peace and blessings be upon him - he was praying to the ka’i With the prayer to the house of the sanctuary after the migration, it is up to the Jews, then turned into the kaaba, so he said: What made us kiss the side: We repeated us except for the people of people.The second: It is permissible for it to be his saying: which you were on the tongue of judgment in making the house of the sanctuary before, it means that the origin of your command is that you are the first of your command.I would like to have a holy house, it was an exposure to a sacrament, but we made the kiss that you were before, before this, and it is the house of the sanctuary; Let people be crowded and look at whoever follows the Messenger and whoever does not follow him and repels him.And here we are a third face that Father mentioned A Muslim, and he said: Without the narratives, the verse would not indicate a tribal by the Messenger - peace and blessings be upon him - upon him; Because it was said: I was in the sense that you have become an upper saying: You were the best of a nation [Al -Imran: 110] and it was said: It was in the sense that it did not come as a saying: 158] It is not possible to want to say it: and what we have made the kiss that you were on, that is: the one that did not remain on it, which is the kaaba, except so and so.* * * As for his saying: except to know whoever follows the Messenger from those who turn to his two hurds, then he has an questions: the first question: the mother is in the saying of God: And the words are that it is valid for the sake of God, or is it not correct?It is possible that it is not correct, so how to interpret these words, it has been presented.The second question: What made us such and so is only to know, as is the illusion that the knowledge of that thing was not that it was happening.It requires that God Almighty did not know those things before their fall, and his counterpart in the forms is his saying: Let us give you until we know the prestige of you and those who are blessed And he said: Now God relieved you and know that in your weakness [Al -Anfal: 66] and his saying: Perhaps he will remember or fear [Taha: 44] and say: Let him not know.[Al -Ankabut: 3] And his saying: Or did you count that you enter Heaven, and when God knows those who are ready from you and know the patient [Al -Imran: 142] and he said: Let us know whoever believes in the hereafter [Saba: 21] and the words in this question is a decrease in his saying: And when he was born and the interpreters, they answered from him: His saying: Unless we know with its meaning: except that our party will know from the prophets and the believers as the king says: So we open the country of the country: It is said: The old age opened, and it is his saying - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - when he tells him about his Lord: “ I am not saying: I am free and I am forever.And the second: it is: to obtain the enemy, and he will become angry, so he said: Unless we know with it: except to know it, it is necessary, then it is said: We said: They differed that the knowledge is that the thing will exist, is it the knowledge of its existence if it is found, the disagreement is in it.And the third of it: except for the distinction of these from these, by exposing what is in their hearts of salvation and hypocrisy, so that the believers know who those who are from them and those who are returned, and the name of the name; Because it is one of the benefits of knowledge and his fruits.And the one is: Unless we know with it: except to see, and this is the metaphor that the Arabs put the science of the place of the vision, and the vision is the place Knowledge is like his saying: Did you not see how I saw, I knew, and I witnessed, a punishment.Fifth: What is gone to the deceased: that the knowledge of science in this verse is returned to the addressees, and for example, it is ignorant and rational, so that the ignorant says: The sane: Rather, the fire burn the widow, and we will be combined between them, so we know, which one of them burns his owner with its meaning: to know which is the ignorant, so let him say: And the abuse of this sex is from the words: the attachment and the companion in the speech, as it said: or you are not for this For the speech and accompanied by the addressee, so he said: except to know.And its sixth: We treat you with the perpetuated treatment that is not known, as justice is required.And the sake of it: that science is an increase, and he said it: Unless we know who follows the Messenger of those who turn to his two hurds: And the conversion of the two transfers, and its counterpart, your saying in the thing that you deny from your soul: what God has known is from me, that is, what was this from me, and the meaning is that it is for me.The third question: they disagreed that this insult was obtained by the certainty The kiss; Because he - peace and blessings be upon him - was praying to the Kaaba, and when the city came, he prayed to the house He turned it once again to the Kaaba, that is the hardship of that of Jews from where he left their kisses, and as for the largest of the people of the investigator, they said: This is this The manifestation, then they said: If Muhammad ﷺ, if he was on the authority of his command, his opinion would not have changed, the lock was narrated from the son of Jarraj, that he said that he said: He became Muslim, and they said: Once again, and once, and the sixth said: When the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him - directed the ritual of the mosque, the people were dispersed; The opponents said: What was with them were before and then left it, and the Muslims said: We do not know the state of our brothers who died while they prayed, and they prayed.I miss the country of his father and his birth, and the participants said: He was confused in his debt, (P-96) and he learned that this is the first saying.Because the suspicion is in the matter of copying is greater than the suspicion that has been caused by the certainty of the kiss, and God Almighty has described it with the great, then he said: If it is for the one who is a greatness So he was carried on him.The following question: His saying: Whoever turns against his two necks is a slogan, and it is: who is atone for God and His Messenger, and the path His necks have left what Between his hands and a man who was tired of him, so when they left faith and the evidence, they became the house of the mastermind of what is between his hands, so they described this, as he said: And when he said: He lied and turned [Taha: 48] and all of that resembles him.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: If it is in it, the first question is: (if) the light broken, it is based on four aspects: the reward, and the fear of the And an uniform, and an increased, and the part is the one who is the one who is one of the two sentences with the last, for the seizure is the condition, and the defect is the penalty, as you say: The second: It is the fearful of the ethnic, as it benefits the affirmation of the meaning in the sentence in the sense of (that) the tightening is like your saying: that is the increase of the existing, the one said: It is a preservation of it [Al -Tariq: 4] and said: If our Lord is considered an effective [Al -Israa: 108] and the same in the Qur’an is many, and the abuse in its relief is to be reduced to it, and it is not permissible.The lam is required for this lightness of the statuses of what was deleted from it, and the difference between it and between the one who is for the one who says: The infidel is in the words of the infidel.And his saying: If I follow, except for what is revealed to me [Al -Anam: 50], if each one of them was followed by the name and the verb all as we described, and the third: It is the one who is the one who is the one who says: The judgment is only for God [Al -Anam: 57] and he said: If you follow except the suspicion [Al -Anam: 148] and he said: And if they are still holding them [Fatir: 41], that is: what he holds them, and the one who is grateful So you said: Once you saw a more.إذا عَرَفَتْ هَذا فَنَقُولُ: (إنْ) في قَوْلِهِ: وإنْ كانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً هي المُخَفَّفَةُ الَّتِي تَلْزَمُها اللّامُ, والغَرَضُ مِنها تَوْكِيدُ المَعْنى في الجُمْلَةِ.The second question: the guerrilla in its saying: It was to anything that returns?In it, Jahan: The first: that he returns to the kiss; Because he must have a precedent mentioned and that is only the kiss in his saying: We did not make the kiss that you were on.The second: It is a source of what is indicated by the previous words, and it is the separation of the kiss, and the ethnicity of the atrocity; Because he said: What they have before their before they were on which they were upon them, then he said a kindness on this: and if you were great, that is: if you are the height; Because his saying: What they have indicated to the height, as it was said in his saying, the Almighty: Do not eat what is not mentioned by the name of God, and it is for him: 121] The meaning is: If this is the verb, its counterpart is his saying, then it is blessed, and I know that this research is separated from the question, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was And the lat and the same kiss, or by turning the kiss, and we have indicated that the second is first; Because the forms that have been in the cause of copy With the great saying in his saying: If you are great.As for his saying, the Almighty is a greatness, the meaning: a hard disturbance, denounced, as his saying: a word was greater that comes out of their mouths (p-97) (5) Farah is with that, and God Almighty said: Glory be to you, this is a great bit.The kiss, our saying: If it is left it, it is a trustworthy; Because that it requires the killing of a thousand and the habit, and the symptoms of the narration of fathers and the predecessors, and if we say: the two of the two signs were signed by the ritual of the kiss, our saying: It is not a person who is not.He can know that this is a right, unless he knows the question of copy Know that he does not deny the transmission of the kiss from one side to one side, as it is not denying that it is transferred to them from one state to the case in health, fertilization, richness and poverty, so whoever is more His eyesight, and whoever sheds it and followed the passion, and he made the things of the affairs, and this question was gone on.As for his saying: Except for those who guided God, the companions took this verse in the question of the creation of the work The knowledge, and the first vicinity is here That is beyond that, and the guidance in the sense of the supplication, and the evidence is general in general in the right That is what is meant by the guidance is the creation of the knowledge and the knowledge, and it is the one who is required.He specialized them with that.And secondly: He wanted to appeal.And the third of it: that they are the ones who took advantage of the guidance of God, so others, as if they were not accustomed to them.The answer to everyone: It is left to the back, so it will be in the dispute of the original, and God knows.* * * As for His Excellency, the Exalted: And God would not have lost your faith, and he has anxes: The first question: And the Bin Bin Maarour, and otherwise they died on the first kiss, so their fans said: O Messenger of God This verse.And know that some of this reason must be connected, otherwise some of the words are not connected, and the report of the disability is that those who did not allow the copy Judgment changes, and the judgment must be spoiled and invalid, so they fell into their hearts, based on this question that Those are the prayers that they came to go to the sanctuary of the sanctuary, which was lost, then God Almighty answered this forms and indicated that the copy is from Reconciliation, and from a cost to action, and the first is like the second in that the one who is in which he is held in the debt, and that whoever is his condition is that he does not waste his reward, and what is his reward, and what he has.The deprivation of the wine who died and was drinking it, so God Almighty revealed: He is not on those who believed and did the righteous ghosts [Al -Ma’idah: 93] so God knows them, and God does not.And when this was the pornography of God, then it was said: If the doubt is that it was born from the permanence of the infection on God Almighty, then how is it that you are accompanied by the companions?We said: The answer is from faces: one of them: that suspicion is a slope of hypocrites, so God mentioned the Almighty to remind him of the Muslims as an answer to the question.And the second: Perhaps they believed that the prayer to the Kaaba is better, and they said: If our brothers are from whoever died, I will realize that, so God mentioned (P-98), the Almighty.And the third of it: Perhaps the Almighty mentioned this speech to be a payment for that question if he had been in their mind.The second saying: It is the saying of Ibn Zaid that God is upholstered if he knows that the righteousness is in your transfer from the house of the sanctuary to the kaaba, so if he would come to you to the prayer of the prayer For your prayers because they are on this estimation free from reconciliation, so they will be lost, and God Almighty does not do that.The third saying: It is up to the one who mentioned what they have in this manifestation in this manifestation of his punishment by mentioning what they have for him from the reward, and that he does not do what he does, and he does not do what he does, Good.The righteous saying: As if it is the highest, he said: I have succeeded in the acceptance of this cost, so that your faith will not be lost, for if they responded to this, they would not be disbelieved, and they will be disbelieved, and they will be disbelieved And he said: And God would not have lost your faith, so he would not be a jurisdiction to the acceptance of this cost and help you.The second question: they disagreed with his saying: God would not have lost your faith with a speech with whom?On two sayings: The first saying: that with the believers, and the locking of this saying is four: the first one: the first: that God addressed the one who has been Then, there is an answer for what they asked before.The second: They asked those who died before the kissing of the kiss, so God Almighty answered them by saying: And God would not have to waste your faith, that is: if your faith is the same Likewise, the faith of those who died before the copy.The third: It is permissible for life to be deluded that this is when we were dirty, and what comes to it was after the copy The question about the matter of themselves to this warning from Tawlid, and they asked about their brothers who have died and did not come with what he disbelieves in what he was preceded, and it was said: And God would not have lost your faith and what is good for you, the people of your mourning, as well The present in the time of Muhammad ﷺ: And when you killed a soul [Al -Baqarah: 72], and when we separated the sea on you [Al -Baqarah: 50].The lord: The question may be a sign of life and the mothers together, so they are separated from what their prayers were to be invalid For the life and the dead, as from the Arabs of the Arabs if they are informed of a present and a clinic to prevail over the speech and say: You were and so is the absent, so you did.The second saying: The saying of my father is a Muslim, which is that it is that it is a speech for the people of the book, and what is meant by faith is their prayers and obedience before the Baath A Muslim, this saying, lest the copying of the copies of us.* * * The third question: the disgraceful of his saying: And God would not have lost your faith on the fact that faith is a name for the act of obedience, for he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not.We receive that what is meant by faith is the prayer, but what is meant by believing and declaration, as if he is a transgression, he said: He does not waste your belief in the obligatory prayer, that is the prayer Here is the prayer, but the prayer is the greatest of faith and the honor of its success and its benefits, so the release of the name of faith on prayer on the path of the urbanization is from this one.The following question: His saying: And God would not have lost your faith, that is: the reward of your faith is not lost because faith has been (p-99) has passed and my technician has passed, and what was like that was not.That the reward for the reward is based after his spending, so he corrected his memorization and his waste, and it is like his words, the Almighty: that I do not waste the work of a worker of you [Al -Imran: 195].* * * As for his saying: God is the people of the Most Merciful.Beginning in a special mercy, which is the payment of the deceased and the removal of the circle as his saying: Do not take you with them as a head in the debt of God [Al -Nur: 2], meaning: Do not About them, and the mercy is that it is a collective name in which this meaning is entered, and it enters the preference and downs Human between the hands of his mercy [Al -A'raf: 57], because it is a preference from God and aid, so God remembered the highest head in the first sense that he does not waste the sons of them, Mercy to be a blessings and most comprehensive, and his mercy does not specialize in that type, but rather is mercy from where he is a heat of the freshness that is the ritual.The second question: Remember in the face These two people are related to what before them are faces: one of them: that he is upset when he was told that he does not waste their faith, he said: God is the people of the Lord, and may God bless you Is this waste imagining from it?And the second: It is a merciful head, so that he will transfer you from one law to another law, and it is good for you and benefit in religion and the world.And the third of it: He said: And if it is a greatness, except for those who guided God, as if he is up to the Almighty, he said: Rather, God guided them because he is a merciful head.The third question: the reader of Amr, Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i, and Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim: A phanting mud on the weight of a luxury, in which the four linguists are also as a butter, and a lighter on the weight of action.* * * The loyal question: the disgraceful of this verse was inferred that it does not create the disbelief or corruption, they said: Because it is the exalted, the people of the people.And the infidels of the people, so it is obligatory to be a merciful head with them, but it will be like if it was not created in them the infidels, which is the one who goes to the punishment, and the one who goes to the punishment, And if they did not cost them what they could not be able to do, then he was up to him, with the same as this harm, a merciful and merciful.The words are upon him, and God knows best.
