The Quranic researcher is the speech in the prophecy, and if you are in a rap, what we have revealed to our servants, so they brought a wall of the like and called your testimony without God, if you are true Do not do, and do not do the fire that is the fire and the fuel of the people and the carpentry were prepared for the disbelievers in the verse: The murmur on the proof of the artists and the pronouncement of the saying by the partner, its punishment, with what indicates the prophecy, and that is indicated by the corruption of the saying of the teachings.God is beneficial from the knowledge of the Messenger, and the saying of the stuffing who say: Do not obtain the knowledge of God except from the Qur’an and the people, and when it was Building on the way of the Qur’an, a miracle, which established the indication of its miraculousness.He knew that his being is a miracle that can be two ways: the first way: to be said: this Qur’an does not leave its condition from one of the three faces of three: The words of the eloquence, or an increase in the path of the righteous, with a destiny that does not pass the habit, or increased to it with destiny that will be destroyed, and the first sects are the same They are invalid; Because if it was like that, it would have been necessary for them to be like a wall of it either as two groups or alienated, for if the conflict falls and obtained from the time The rulers remove the suspicion, and that is an end in the pilgrimage because they were in the knowledge of the language and the view of the pronouncements of the eloquence in the end.And they were in love with his command in the end until they made the souls and the money and committed the wounds of the humiliation and the curse, and they were in the protective and the nose on a limit that is not accepted.And all of that requires the two things that praise in its saying, and the opposition is the strongest pimb, so when they did not come to them, we have been rewarded for them, so he proves that the Qur’an did not.The devotion between it and between their words is not used to be used to, so it is a contradiction that is contradictory to the return, so it is obligatory to be a miracle, so this is what is meant He appeared that he was groaning as he was not satisfied with the definition of the neutralization of the conversion, so in the knowledge of the prophecy, it was not satisfied with the conversion.And he knew that he had gathered in the Qur’an, many faces that require a shortage of his shouting, and with that, it is in the eloquence of the end of the end, and the one who has the end of it is that it is not He is a miraculous one: one of them: that the expression of the Arabs is the most in the description of the scenes such as a description of a ritual, a horse, a neighbor, a king, a wagon, or a stab.And described a cave, and there is nothing in the Qur’an from these things, so it was obligatory for the sake of the eloquence that the Arabs agreed upon in their words.And secondly: He is the Healing of it The path of honesty and its emancipation from the lie in all of it, and every poet who left the lies and the adultery (P-107) the honesty is the descent of his poet Hasan ibn Thabat, when their hair was revealed.And their poetry was not the Islamic, as their poets are the ignorant, and that God Almighty with what he was removed from the lie and the jokes came with the Qur’an as well as.And the third: that the eloquent words and eloquent poetry are agreed in the poem in the house and the two house.The rest is not like that, and the Qur’an is not like that, because all of it is shouting in terms of the creation of creation from it as they cushioned from his sentence.And he paid it: that everyone who said a poetry is shouting in the description of something, then if he repeated it, his second words were not in the description of that thing in the first place.And in the Qur’an, the righteous, and with that one of them in the end of the eloquence, and the recklessness appeared in the first place.Fifth: He is confined to the positiveness of worship and the prohibition of doves and the urge to the honor of the ethical and the unknown of the world and the elders of the hereafter, and the proverbs of these words are the words.And its sixth: that they said: The poetry of Qais is improving at the ritual and the remembrance of the women and the description of the horses, and the hair of the jam is when the fear, and the love of the lord, The wine, and the hair of Zahir with desire and hope, and in a sentence, every poet who improves his words in an art is that he weakens his words other than that.As for the Qur’an, it came as a shouting in all arts on the end of the eloquence, not to see that it is his pursuit and the Almighty said in the desired: Do not know the same as what I am hidden from the sake 17] And he said: And there is what the soul desires and the eyes are delighted [Al -Zukhruf: 71], and he said in Al -Tahib: The earth will be lost, so if it is the dates of the mother of you, the verse [King: 16, 17], and he said: And all the meables are disappointed [Ibrahim: 15], to his saying: And the death comes from him, and he said: He is informed of the east, and it is his saying: all we took with his sins [Al -Ankabut: 40], to his saying: And among them are those who weakened us [Al -Ankabut: 40], and he said in the preacher, there is no more The two years we enjoyed [Al -Shuarah: 205] and he said in the divine: God knows what every female carries, what the wombs are broken down and what is closer to the last [Al -Raad: 8].And its sake: that the Qur’an is the origin of all of the science And the language, the knowledge of the asceticism in the world, and the news of the hereafter and the use of the honorary honor, and whoever contemplates our book in the evidence of miracles is the knowledge that the Qur’an has been in the past The short end.The second way: to say: The Qur’an does not leave either either it is said: It was a language in the eloquence to the limit of miracle, or it was not like that, if the first was proven that it is miraculous, and if the second is the one, then the second is the second.The estimation is possible, so they will be present with the exhibitions with the universe of the opposition, and with their resources to the affairs of it, they will be lost, so it is a matter Surprisingly, it was proven that the Qur’an is incapable of all the faces, and this method is close to us.* * * Because what is meant is to go away with the way of exhaustion, and the remembrance of this memorization is the one who drew this place; Because they were saying: If this was from God and contrary to what was from the people, he would not be descended like this as a surah after a surah on the authority And at the Sunnah of what (P-108) we see the people of discourse and poetry from the existence of what is found from them separately, when they are aware of what appears from the extensive, and the different needs The poet does not show the book of his poetry, and the sentry does not show the book of his messages and his speech is a payment, so if God Almighty will come to him, he will be upon him.A sentence and said those who disbelieved, if not for the Qur’an a single sentence [Al -Furqan: 32], and God is His Glory to Him and He is the one who mentioned what is indicated by the Qur’an This suspicion.And it is reported that this Qur’an is descending on this trend, either that it is from the gender of the enemy of humanity or not, then if the first is required to be in the same way Training, and if the second is proven that it is with the leaving it.And read: (On our servants) He wants the Messenger of God ﷺ and his nation.* * * The third question: The surah is a sect of the Qur’an, and its wow, if it is in the first place, either it is called the city’s chains, which is its stomach; Because it is a group of the Qur’an as limited, such as the round country, or because it is a raw one of the art of science, such as containing the wall of the city on what is in it, or that it is in it, Arrangement; Because the surah is in the house of the homes and the drivers in which the reader is promoted, and it is also in its own tall, medal and short.Or to raise its affairs and the majesty of its place in the debt, and if you made it a conversion to a prodigy, because it is a piece and a group of the Qur’an like the wall of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the wig of the Qur’an And the best of it.If it was said: What is the benefit of cutting the Qur’an is a light?We said: From his faces: one of them: what is for the sake of the cultivation of the manufacturers whose books are doors and chapters.And the second: that the gender, if it is obtained under it, was the individuals of every type of its owner, good.And the third of it: The reader, if you were sealed a wall or a door from the book, then took in another, was active for him and installed the crime of it.He drained the book with his height, and the same as the migrant if he knew that he had cut off a mile or folded a firmness that breathed from him and stimulated it to the way.And he pushed it: that the preservation, if he preserves the surah, believed that he took from the book of God a sect that is independent of itself, and it will be evacuated in its soul, and it is in it, and it is in it, Prayer is fully fully.* * * The following question: Its saying: So they came with a wall of the same as it indicates that the Qur’an and what is on it from his place is a light that is at the end of what he said.Many of the people of the hadith: We are organized on this installation in the days of Uthaman, so this is true once in a wall and once all the Qur’an.The fifth question: Know that the definition of the Qur’an came to faces: one of them: his saying: So they came with a book from God is the most insignificant [Al -Qasas: 49].And the second: His saying: Say: If you collect humanity and heaven, they will come to the same as this Qur’an, they do not come to the same, even if it was one of them.[88] And the third of it: it was said: they came with the same fence, the same as its abstracts [Hood: 13].And its booster: His saying: So they came with a wall of his likeness and a counterpart.In its quarter, come with a question from it, because this is the end in the limit and the removal of the excuse.If it was said: His saying: So they came with a wall of the same as the Surah of the Kawthar, and the wall of the era and the Surah said, O you, the infidels, and we know that we know.With the same or with what is possible from it, if you say: The two proverbs of this light are outside the place The ancients are the accusation of religion.We said: For this reason, the second method has been chosen, and we said: If this surah is notified in the eloquence to the limit They abstain from the opposition with the severity of their halls, to a miraculous matter.On these (P-109), the two estimates will get the miracle.* * * The sixth question: Al -Daadir in his saying: From his likeness to what he returns?In it, Jahan: One of them: that he is a leader to (what) in his saying: From what we have revealed to our servants, that is, they came with a wall of what is on his class in the eloquence of the eloquence, Upon (our servant), that is, they came to whom he is in his case from his mother’s human beings, and he did not read the books and did not take from the scholars, and the first of Mary from the son of Umar Masoud and Ibn Abbas, and Al -Hassan, and the most investigators, and it is indicated by the survival of it.In Yunus, they came with a wall like him [Yunus: 38].And the second: that the search was located in the house because it is He said: And if you are in a rapper from what we have come down, then it is obligatory to show the destiny to it, not to see that the meaning: and if you are arranged in that the Qur’an is descended from God, then what is God, then what is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from God And the case of the synchronization, even if the guerrilla was a repetition to the Messenger of God ﷺ to be said: And if you are arranged that Muhammad is descended from it, then they are a Qur’an from the same.And the third of it: that if the destiny was domesticated to the Qur’an, they would have been required to be unable Cubes, but if he was domesticated to Muhammad ﷺ, then it is not necessary except that one of them is from the illiterate people who are unable The illiterate.As for if they gathered and they were readers, they would not be like Muhammad; Because the group does not similar to the one, and the reader is not the same as the illiterate, nor is it doubtful that the miracle on the first direction is stronger.And its elevation: If we had the oppression of the Qur’an, we would have made it incapable, but it will obtain a majesty of his condition in the eloquence, but if we had the way to Muhammad, then he will be blessed.He completes a report like his condition in his illiteracy, far from science.This is, even if it is miraculous, but that it was not fulfilled only by the acknowledgment of the two deficiencies in the right of Muhammad - peace be upon him - the first was the first.Fifth: If we had the oppression of Muhammad - peace be upon him - if it was delusional that the chests of the Qur’an like the Qur’an were not like the same It is possible, and if we had to the Qur’an, it would have changed that that it was the same as the mother of the illiterate, and the illiterate is not forbidden, so this was the first.* * * The worship is due for what it is beneficial and harmful, so you were driven in a Muhammad's ritual.Know that you are invalidated in the claim of their deities and that it is beneficial and harmful, so it will be in the words a pilgrimage from two sides.From the miracle of the Qur’an and that it is before it.The second: What is meant by the rituals is their oldest or those who agree with them in the denial of the matter And on you, while it can be excused.If it was said: Is (P-110) could be pregnant with them with?And with the ability to excuse them, who are their first?We said: As for the first, it is possible that the testimony is a group of martyrs in the sense of the present or the standing with testimony, so he can make him a metaphor for the one who is the one and the one who is the one and the one who is the one and the one who is the one and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your
