The researcher is the Almighty: The Jews said that the Christians are not on anything, and the Christians said that there is nothing God rules among them the Day of Resurrection, while they were in it, they know that it is up to the first in the first news.And how to deny every sect of the last religion, and we are: (P-8) The first question: His saying: The Christians are not on anything, that is: something that is good, and it is good for him Great, and it is like their saying: less than nothing, and his counterpart is the Almighty saying: Say: O family of the book, you are not on anything until you evaluate the one who said: 68] That is with the fact that the two parties were proven by the two characteristics of his pursuit and the exalted, and that is a saying in which there is a dedication?We said: The answer is from two faces: The first: that when they were destroyed to that good saying, a false saying that the reward of the first loves, as if they did not come to that truth.The second: That this year is related to the matters that they have disagreed with, and it is what connects to the door of the prophets.The second question: It was narrated that the redeeming of Najran when they came to the Messenger of God ﷺ The thief came to them, so they saw them until they did not benefit from them.From religion, and disbelieve in Jesus - peace be upon him - and the Gospels, and the Christians said to them, and they disbelieved in Mousi - peace be upon him - and Al -Tawara.The third question: they disagreed with those who are those who are exalted, the most important of those who were from the mission of Jesus, peace be upon him, or in the time of Muhammad, peace be upon him?And the truth is the truth that there is no indication in the phenomenon of it, and if the first is to carry on all the Jews and all the Christians after the mission of Jesus, peace be upon him, and there is no reason for what we say, and there is no reason for what we say, Jews addressed the Christians with that, so God revealed this verse - that he is not wanted by the verse, if it is possible, if he can carry him on his appearance, and he said: He said: It is beneficial to the general, so what is directed is in his handicap, and it is known from the way of Juda and the Christians that they were since they were, this is the saying of each of them in the other.As for the saying of the Almighty: they recite the book, the wow is for the state, and the book is for the tongue, meaning: they said that, and the situation is that they are among the people of the sciences and recitation for the book, and the right Or other than the books of God and believe in it - not to atone for the rest; Because every one of the two writings is true to the second, a witness to his authenticity.As for the saying of the Exalted: Likewise, those who do not know, then it is necessary that those who offer his remembrance must be a scholar, so that this is true, So, the Almighty indicated that they are with the knowledge and recitation, if they are different from this difference, so how can someone who does not know, and know that this is the one who is in the eyes فَإنَّ كُلَّ طائِفَةٍ تُكَفِّرُ الأُخْرى مَعَ اتِّفاقِهِمْ عَلى تِلاوَةِ القُرْآنِ, ثُمَّ اخْتَلَفُوا فِيمَن هُمُ الَّذِينَ لا يَعْلَمُونَ عَلى وُجُوهٍ: أوَّلُها: أنَّهم كُفّارُ العَرَبِ الَّذِينَ They said: The Muslims are not on anything, so he explained that if the saying of Jews and the Christians, they read the books, he will not be accepted, and he will be accepted, and he will be accepted The Arabs are not satisfied with it.And the second: that if we carry his saying: The Jews said that the Christians are not on anything on those who were present in the time of Muhammad الملي Throughout them, a separation between their properties and their inhabitants, and the first is close; Because all the Jews and the Christians entered the verse, whoever distinguishes them from his saying: Likewise, he said who do not know that he must be other than them.As for the saying of the Almighty: God rules between them, in his four faces: one of them: Al -Hasan said: He deny them all and enters them.And the second: the ruling on the elvinated unjust to the lying grievance.And the third of it: whoever enters paradise will be given to them, and whoever enters the fire, and is the saying of the gospel.And the one who is seen: He rules the right and invalidated, as they disagreed about it, and God knows.
