The researcher is the Almighty.The limits of God shows it for a people who know that this is the fifth judgment of the rulings of divorce, and it is that the third divorce is a severity of the right of the back The first question: Those who said: It is his saying or a relaxing with good refinement to the third divorce, they said: It is his saying: If it divorces it, it will be made.With charity, and this is a saying of a jurisdiction, except that we have indicated that the first is not to be what is meant by his saying: a secret with the charity of the third divorce; That is because the husband has with the woman after the second divorce, three conditions, one of which is: to return it, and it is intended to say it: so that it is not a matter It leaves it until the enemy passes and gets between the two, and it is intended to say it: or is easy with charity and the third: to divorce it with a third divorce, and it is a third time He divorced them, if you are three sections, and God is the highest of three conservatives, then each one of the three conservatives must be downloaded to the means of the three of the three.Sleeping with goodness from the third divorce, we have shown us to one sense on the path of the righteousness, and we are the most important of the division.And I know that the occurrence of the verse of immorality in between these two verses is like the foreigner, and the verse is: the divorce is two times, so I will hold it with a well It is permissible for him after you get married.If it is said: If the correct systems are this, then what is the reason for the rhythm of the verse of immorality in between these two verses?(P-90) Say: The reason is that the return is not.The third divorce, but after it, nothing remains of that.For this reason, God mentioned the ruling of the return and then followed him with the ruling of the immorality, then he mentioned after all the ruling of the third divorce; Because it is like a trick for all the rulings that are considered in this section, and God knows.* * * Its stirring, then it is called it, then it is accustomed to it, and Said ibn Jabir and Saeed ibn al -Musayyib said: It is permissible with the inception of the contract, and the disagreement of the scholar is that With the Sunnah or in the book, Abu Muslim Al -Asfahi said: The two things are announced in the book.This is the choice.Before the ritual in the evidence, it is necessary to be alerted to a precursor.With the recovery, then if they said: So -and -so, they wanted to do so, and they wanted to be held on it, and if they said: He marched his wife or his husband, they wanted to collect it.And I say: This is what Abu Ali said as a verdict that is achieved according to the two mental laws; Because the addition between the two things is a manner of each one of the two additions, then if it was said: We marry so that it is his husband, then this marriage is between him For this marriage is a male and his husband, then the wife is not a name for that woman with the same sense With the zoom, the wife is a compound from the self and from the zoom, and the individual is presented, not referred to the installation.If this is proven, then he says: If we say: So that it is so and so, then the marriage is delayed from the concepts from al -Zujujah, and the aging is the one who is ahead A wife, the individual is presented to the compound, and if it is like that, the piece is necessary that that marriage is not the same, if this is proven, then it was the saying of it: Other than that, it is necessary for that marriage other than the wilderness.It is indicated by slowness, and its saying: a husband that indicates the contract, and the saying of those who say: The verse is not indicative of the slow, but the slow, but it is clear.Weakening; Because the verse requires the negation of the solution, which is extended to an end, and it is his saying: until it marries and what was absent for the woman, it is necessary The sanctity is when the marriage was made, and if the marriage was a phrase for the contract, the verse would have indicated that the forbidden is to the end of the forbidden, so it is the same With the news, it is copying the Qur’an with the news of one, and it is not permissible.But if the marriage is carried on the slowdown, and we made it saying: a husband on the contract, this is not obligatory, and the famous news in the Sunnah is what is narrated.Al -Qarashi, she was under the reaction of Bin Wahb Bin A Atik Al -Qarashi, the son of her cousin, so he divorced her three, so she married the servant of Al -Rahed.The Prophet came ﷺ and said: I was under the reaction, so I divorced me, and my divorce came, and I got married after him, Abd al -Rahman, the son of the son, and what is the same, and what is the same.And he divorced me before he is touched, I return to Ibn Ami?Not until you taste his affliction and taste your affliction.If my husband touched me, then the Messenger of God ﷺ and said: I lied to the first, and I will not believe you The other.So the Messenger of God was dominated, so Abu Bakr came to permission, and he said: Do not return to me.So she went until he went to his path, and Omar came, so she was permissible.And in the story (P-91), the reaction of his saying: If you divorce it, then it will not be permissible for him after until you marry a husband other than him.The solution is on this condition, the dawn of the husband, from divorce, because the majority is that the husband denies that his husband is spreading another man God forbids the Prophet the Prophet to recite otherwise, because of the abhorrent in it, and it is known that the dirt is, but it will be completed by the loyalty of the solution, and the solution is on the one There is no excessive increase in it, so it is not correct to make it forbidden and mob At the end of it, then she returned to the first with a new marriage, and he had only one divorce, and it was that he remained for him from the first divisions, and the father said: Three, as if it was a young woman after the three.Because it is a divorce and found after the two divisions, and the third divorce is due to the thick prohibition; And his saying: If it is divorced by it, the third divorced divorce is released by the third time The following question: The Shafi’i is gone, may God be pleased with him: if he marries the divorced woman three for others, if he will be permitted to the first, then he will not be in the first A marriage is used for an unjust time, and it is false, and if it is married to it, it is not necessary to divide it if it is permissible for the first to the first, then it is said: The condition, and with it, Abu Hanifa said.And Ahmad: This marriage is false, our indication is that the verse indicates that the sanctity is ended with a preacher, with a contract, and it has been found, and it is necessary, and it is necessary, and it is necessary.We have the corruption of the marriage, so that the solution is to say?The second husband, which he married after the third divorce; The divorced and the first husband is to repeat with a new marriage, so he mentioned.Marriage with the reference; Because the young woman was getting between them before that, then if you marry, they would be referred to what they had from the marriage, so this is brought up.* * * It remains in the verse two issues: the first question: the appearance of the verse requires that when the second husband will be released to it, the bouquet of the first welfare is permissible, except that it is With his exalted saying: And the divorced women are lengthening themselves with three readers, because what is meant by the number of mercy, and this is the meaning of this, and this is the meaning of this Said ibn al -Masib, on the authority that the solution is obtained by the inception of the contract; Because the slow, even if it was considered, the numbers were obligatory, and this verse indicates the stalls of the number; Because the fulfillment is in his saying: It is not a wing for them to refer to it indicates that the solution of the boundaries has the mind of the second husband, except that the answer is not.The second question: Al -Khalil and Al -Kisa’i said: It is placed to be trapped by a reduction in the rejectionist guarantee, its estimation: to be trapped, and the vastness said: Rejectionist.* * * (P-92) As for his words, the Exalted: If we think that the limits of God will be in the first place: the first question: He said a lot from the interpreters, if we think that we do not know that God's limits, and this saying is weak from his faces: one of them: that you do not say: I knew to be more of more, but I knew that he is increasing.The second: that a person does not know what is in destiny, but rather he thinks.The third: It is in the house of its words, the Almighty: and they are their right to their cold in that if they want to be a prayer; For the one who is considered there is the suspicion, then this is our way, and if this saying is prolonged, then what is meant by the same thought is, that is, when this thinking is obtained, and he has the intention of the resurrection, This is good, and when this thinking did not get and feared at the boundaries of the emergence of it or a renovation of it, the bull is prohibited.The second question: the word “if” in the language of the condition, and the condition is related to the condition of the condition of the condition, so the appearance of the verse requires that it is that it is not the same The budget did not get the boundaries, but it is not like that; If the boundaries are fixed, whether this suspicion is obtained, or it is not obtained, except that we say: It is not what is meant that this is a condition for the sake of the return, but it is from it.When the new marriage is the pursuit of the rights of God, the Exalted, and the intention of residence for the limits of God and His orders.* * * Then he said after that: And that is the limits of God showing it for people who know and in which there are books: the first question: the saying of the Almighty: and that is the one who is the same The clogged, and its saying: it shows a sign of the future, and the collection between them is contradictory, and when these texts that have been brought to the most of them are provided Many specializations, and the most of those specialties, but it was known as Sunnah, so what was meant, and God knew that these rulings that are presented are And God will show it, as well as the Bayan, on the tongue of his Prophet ﷺ, and he is like his words, the Almighty: to show people what we have come to them [Al -Nahleh: 44].The second question: a reader has read in the narration of Dhana: The third question: The scholars have been specialized in this Bayan for his wings: one of them: that they are those who interact with the verses, so others are in the house of it, and it is not the same, and it is not the same as it.This is a guidance for the righteous [the cow: 2].The second: He specialized them with the remembrance as his saying: His angels, his messengers, Gabriel, and Mical [Al -Baqara: 98].The third: The Arabs mean to them for their knowledge with the tongue.And the lord: He wants those who have a mind and knowledge, as his saying: What the scientists do not realize (the spider: 43) and what is meant is that it only costs a scholar of what is assumed; Because when it was like that, I have been removed from the cost of the cost.And the fifth: that his saying: And that is the limits of God, meaning what is presented by his remembrance of the rulings that God shows it to those who know that God has revealed the book and the one who did the ritual.And they ended what they were forbidden.
