The Quranic researcher said in the establishment of connotation on the neutrality, the prophecy, and the re -re -.You fear that the earth has a butterfly and the sky with a constructive and the sky from the sky, so he brought it out of the fruits of the garments of you, so do not make it to you, and you will not make it.These verses are: the first question: that God is exalted when the rulings of the three groups were presented, meaning the believers, the infidels, and the hypocrites, I accept it, and the one who accepts them.Remissible in his words, the Almighty: We are worshiped and you seek help [Al -Fatih: 4] and in it a good: one of them: that there is a more shaking and saving you as if you are from the one who is the one who is the one who is a shake and a sacrifice from you To your companion, it is narrated from a third: that so, so that his story is Katt and Katt, then you address that third, so you said: So, so that you can ask the rituals of the way, This resignation from the absence to the presence requires more to move you to that third.وثانِيها: كَأنَّهُ سُبْحانَهُ وتَعالى يَقُولُ: جَعَلْتُ الرَّسُولَ واسِطَةً بَيْنِي وبَيْنَكَ أوَّلًا, ثُمَّ الآنَ أزِيدُ في إكْرامِكَ وتَقْرِيبِكَ, فَأُخاطِبُكَ مِن غَيْرِ واسِطَةٍ, لِيَحْصُلَ لَكَ مَعَ Alerting it on the evidence, honoring the addressee and the whole.And the third of it: that it is felt that the servant, if he is in the slave of the slave, is ever in the way, by the way that it is in this verse, from the abandonment.And the one that is the one: that the advanced verses were in the story of their conditions, and these verses are a matter and aversion, so it is a cost and a hardship, so it is not possible The cost, and that spare is that the king of the Malouk is raised from the one between the between and addresses them in the same way To do so, then it becomes that hardship for the sake of that speech.* * * Who mentioned it if the return is in it to the transfer, then it is a Muslim, and if the cause is in which the believers are obtained by the city on the many without the place of this Because it is permissible to address the believers once with their ranks, and once in the name of their sexes, and he may command who is not a believer in the servants of the servants, as well With the righteousness of worship and increases from it, the speech in the whole is possible.* * * The third question: Know that the most frequent expressions are indicative of matters: either or otherwise, but the righteousness is: like the name, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the verb, the third.The three are indicated by each of them, which is in itself.Specialized, and other than the righteousness: the stone, the sky, and the earth, and the memorial of the call, did not make a sign of something other, but it is a word that runs the work of the work of the work of the work of the work Warning.As for those who were pleased with our saying: “O Zaid” by calling for more, or I address the increase, then it is a mistake from his faces: one of them: that our saying: And denying, and our saying: O Zid, does not need it.And the second: that our saying, O Zid, requires a good increase in the immediate, and our saying is that it is increasing, so it does not require that.And the third of it: that our saying: O Zid, it requires a good increase, addressed by this discourse, and our saying: I call for more, it does not require that it is that it is not a good thing I call for more.And its elevation: that our saying that I call for more news about the call, and the news about the call is other than the call, and the call is our saying: O Zid, then we say: So you have proven that the corruption of this saying, and then we are a joke that we remember, which is: that the strongest of the calamities is the name, and the weakening of the letters, so it is not the same, so it is not the same.With the letters, as well as the greatest of the existence is the truth, its pursuit and the exalted, and the weakness of the human being and the creation of the human being is weak [the women: 28] so the angels said: What is the right of them.It spoils in it [the cow: 30] and it was said: The name may be destroyed with the letters in the event of calling, so so the human beings are reconciled to the servants of the Lord in the case of the call and the harm to us.[Al -Araf: 23], and your Lord said, “Let me respond to you [Ghaffir: 60].* * * The following question: “Oh,“ a letter that is placed in its origin to give the distant, even if it is to give the relative, but because of a very important matter, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, Then he was used to call for someone who is unjust and disappeared, and if he approached it, he has a distant home..We said: It is a repetition of itself from the widow of the corpus and what it brings it closer to the homes of those close to its souls and a declaration of it in the way of the narration of the way His saying: “I am broken by their hearts for me.* * * Fifth question: “Any” and a link to the call in what is in the thousand and the blame as it is “with” and “who” is two prayers to the description of the names of the gests and the description of the knowledge He decides to what removes his dignity, so he must be added to the name of an angelic, or what he runs in his paths, and he will be described by him until he gets the intention of the one who does not, so he will do so It is any and the name is a loyalty to it, such as your saying: O Zid Al -Zuraif, except that whatever he does not underestimate itself, he will receive more, so he did not relieve the righteousness, The aromatic alert Between the adjective and its Sufism in its two benefits: the first: the tanker of the calling of the appeal with a certainty with its meaning, and the second: its fall is inspired by what is worthy of any of the additions The Book of God, the Heavy Calling on this way, to extract this affirmation and emptiness, for all that God has called upon His servants, and the people of the people, And the expropriations of the advanced people with great matters, and things that must be consumed to awaken them with them that they are unaware of them, for this is that it is necessary.* * * The sixth question: know that his saying: O people, worship your Lord This was a specialization for the public.We are research: the first search: that the universal gathering is noticed by the lament of the definition, it benefits the general, and the dispute is with the Ash'ari and the judge, Abu Bakr and Abu Hashem What is the general benefit as his saying: all the angels were glorified all of them.Paying; Because it is correct for each one of the people from it and the discretion, it comes out of what it is for the entry of it, so it is obligatory to benefit the general, and the completeness of its jurisprudence.The second research: When it was proven that his saying is up to the Almighty: O people, all of the people who were in the era of that time are in the era of that That or not?And the closest is that they do not take them; Because his saying: O people, a discourse is a disclosure and the discourse of the scout with the aggressor, it is not permissible, and also, then those who will find after that are what they were in the case, and they are not in the case Mawjoud is not a human being, and what is not a person who does not enter under his saying: O people, then it was said: It is obligatory that nothing from this After that time and that it is a piece of cutting, we said: If there was no sign of separated, the matter was like that, except that we recognized the frequency of the debt of Muhammad.The right of those who will have the right after that until the time of the hour, so that this is the connotation that is in general.The third research: its saying: O people, worship your Lord, a matter of all of worship, so does all the servants of all worship benefit all worship?The right does not; Because his saying, worship it, enter this whatever in existence, so if they come with an individuality of the essences of what is in the existence, then enter the wiped out; Because the individual is one of the individuals of what is disturbed by the essence; Because this worship is a phrase for worship with the restriction of this, and when the compound was found, it was found that it was raised, so the one who came to the one who came to the heart of the heart.And the one With worship, it comes to complete what he said, his saying: worship and if it is like that, it must be left for the task It must be for the sake of its being worship; Because the ruling on the description of the description is upset, not if the description is appropriate for the judgment, and we are the place of worship, for the sake of the servants of the servants The worship is a phrase of the greatness of God, the Almighty and the purification of the subjugation of it, and all of that is appropriate in the minds, and if it is proven that it is a worship of the cause of the matter of the matter It is ordered by it; Because it was when the cause was obtained, the judgment must be obtained, not a case.The loyal researcher: For a saying to say: His saying: O people, worship, and the disbelievers do not give up.Because the infidels cannot be the commanders of faith, and if it is forbidden, then it is forbidden to be commanding people with worship, but it is not that they can not Because the matter is with the knowledge of God Almighty, either that he will be in the state of his being, as it is not known to God Almighty, or if he is a disobedience to God, and if he is the same, if there is no one who will come to God By God, it will be impossible to be a disobedience to the command of God Almighty; Because the knowledge of the description is with ignorance with the self is referred, and if it would be in this state in this state, it was that it had been informed of the matter in the event that it is not possible for him to know that he is not aware of it.The matter, and that is the unbearable of what is unbearable, and if the matter will be informed of the knowledge if it is a shame in God, then this is referred; Because it is an order to obtain the hall, and that is not possible, so it has proven that the infidel is impossible to be a matter of crops, and if it is a matter Working with worship; Because he is either ordered by worship before (P-78) known and is referred; Because the worship of those who do not know a miracle or a matter of worship after the knowledge, except that this is the ability to worship the worship of the servants, and the worship is what is wrong with the worship, The matter of the knowledge is forbidden, the matter of worship was also obedient, and it is also possible for this speech to be with the believers; Because they worship God, then command them to worship, and it is an order to obtain the hayes while it is referred.And the answer: One of the people who said: The matter of worship is based on the acquisition of the knowledge, as the matter is the zakat, which is established by the King of the Nisaba, and these are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Drush, and for those who did not say that this verse is inferred that the knowledge is not a warning, and he said: The matter of worship is the worship, and the worship is not, and the worship is not By the way, it is a matter of its warnings, as the purity, if it is not correct except by the water, was brought to the water and is obligatory, and the forehead is not valid from it.By presenting the knowledge of God Almighty, then it is obligatory, and the speaker does not correct the prayer from him except by providing the purity, so it is obligatory, and the deposit is not possible.To them, the pursuit was obligatory, so it is correct that the infidel be addressing the worship, and the condition of the two cames with it is the first of faith, then the one who comes to the servants, then the servants of this To them: The matter is to make a definition of the knowledge, and we said: This question is excluded in the origins, which we say here: This is the words, even if it is completed in all of what is in all of what is done Come on to know him, for he does not conduct, as this is one of the attributes, so why is it permissible and the arrival of the matter with that?We greeted that, so why is it not permissible for this matter to be said to be the believer?.His saying is that he becomes a matter of having a matter that is referred to, and he said: When this is excused, then we carry it, either on the matter of the one who is in the authority of the servant, or upon the authority of the servant From it, and it is known that the increase in worship is worship, so the interpretation of his saying is correct: they worship the leadership in worship.Fifth search: Menukro Al -Takilif said: It is not permissible for the arrival of the matter from God to the Almighty to the way of its faces: one of them: that the mandate is either that he will be fulfilled Its actions to the verb, the leaving, or the case of the two of them are on the other hand.Because in the event of leveling, it is forbidden to get the hypothesis; Because the level is contradictory, the gathering is between them, and the action of the verb is if the supplications are given to the unbearable, even if the second is the one who is the second.Because the one who is wrapped in the case of the righteous was the one who was forbidden to fall, otherwise the place was unjust, and if the state of the sake is the case of the absence of the one who is the one المَرْجُوحِيَّةِ مُمْتَنِعَ الوُقُوعِ أوْلى, وإذا كانَ المَرْجُوحُ مُمْتَنِعَ الوُقُوعِ كانَ الرّاجِحُ واجِبَ الوُقُوعِ ضَرُورَةَ أنَّهُ لا خُرُوجَ عَنِ النَّقِيضَيْنِ, إذا ثَبَتَ هَذا فالتَّكْلِيفُ إنْ It was made by the righteous, the deposit was to create to find what is obligatory to fall, and if it was signed by the most prominent, the expression was to be action with what is not the same.And the second: that the one who responded to the expression is either that God has learned in the eternal and his fall, or he knew that he does not fall or he did not know, neither this nor that, if he was the first The forbidden of the numbers, so there is no extensive in the arrival of the matter with it, and if it is not aware of it, it was the prohibition of the struggles and the obligation This is not that, that was a saying of ignorance of God Almighty and he is referred; Because in the ability to be the matter, the matter is like that, it is not distinguished by the obedience from the sinner, and then it is not in obedience.And the third of it: that the matter of the matter is either It will be a vagina or no for a maximum, so if it is a vagina, it is either a bid to the servants or to the game, but to the idol, it is a referral; Because it is complete for itself, and the whole is for itself that it is not complete with it; Because we know (P-79) with the harm that the high God is over and overwhelmed by the righteousness of the righteousness of the servant and his prostration, and as for the fridge, and in the absence; Because all of the benefits are counted in the glorification of the pleasure and the payment of the pain, and it is its pursuit and the exalted be able to obtain all of that to the servant of the slave of this The hardships, so it is a vast one, and the messenger is unable to the wise.And the one that is: that the servant is not found to his acts; Because it is not a scholar of its conquest, and whoever does not know the conqueror of the thing is not found for him, and if the servant is not found to be the verb of the soul of the same He created it in it, so he did it by having the arrival, and if he commanded him, if he did not create it in it, then he was commanded by the transfer, and all of that is invalid.Fifthly: that the intended from the cost is the purification of the heart on what the narrators of the Qur’an indicated, and if we were able to do a person who is in a man who has been in the absence If he had the apparent actions, he would have become a deepest one for him from being used in the knowledge of God, the Almighty, then he must be taken away from this And the people said: If the intended and the rule in the costs, the reasonable judgments must be followed.The answer to the first three of the two sides: the first: that the companions of this suspicion are obligated to what they mentioned, the inconsistency of the integrity, so this is the same.The second: that we have a good thing to come to the Almighty, whether it was not unbearable or otherwise; Because it is an immortal possession of money, and the angels do not have to be attached to it in his action.Sixth search: They said: The matter is worship, and if it is general to all people, but it is special in the right To say the Almighty: God does not cost a soul except its capacity [Al -Qar: 286].And among them who said: It is specialized in the right of the slave; Because God Almighty has to obey their loyalty, and their assumption of the obedience to the loyalty, which prevents them from being worried about worship, and the matter indicates that the matter is upon the authority The garment of worship, and the private is presented over the year, and the words in this sense are mentioned in the origins of jurisprudence.* * * The servant is not entitled to the reward of the reward; Because when he created him and his enemies on us, because For the servants of worship, then we will be the worship of worship for the duty, and the human being is not worthy of performing the duty, so it is obligatory that he does not fulfill the servant of the servant God Almighty.* * * As for his saying: Your Lord, who created you and those who were before you, may you fear you, and he will have the first: He added it to what is indicated by the existence of the champions, and it is the creation of the costs and the creation of those before them, and this indicates that there is no way to the knowledge of God, and the Lord, and the Lord, From the stupidity in this way, and they said: Exaggeration of this science with a heresy, and we have in the proof of our people, the faces of a transmission and the mind, and the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one: Bayan is the best of this knowledge, which is from the faces: one of them: that the honor of science with the honor of the knowledge His attributes and his attributes must be the knowledge that is attached to the honor of the sciences.Religious, as for religious science, it is that it is the knowledge of the origins, or what it prompted, but what is meant, it is standing on its health on the science of the origins; Because the interpreter is searching for the suffering of the words of God, the Almighty, and that is a branch on the existence of the chosen creatures, and the one who talks about the one who searches is the one who searches for the words.ﷺ This is a branch on the evidence of his prophets ﷺ, and the jurisprudence is searching for the rulings of God, and that is a branch on the neutrality Permanent to the science of origins, and the most promising that the knowledge of origin is rich in it, so the science of origins should be the honor of the sciences.And the third of it: that the honor of the thing may appear by the midst of a sense against it, so the word against him is a brother, the more he was honored, and against the knowledge of the origins, the one who is the disbelief, and the one who is the disbelief, So the knowledge of origins should be the honor of things.And its elevation: that the honor of the thing may be with the honor of its position and it may be for the sake of the severity Everyone, and that because the knowledge of the body is honored by the knowledge of the medicine, given that the subject of the knowledge of the body is honored by the mandate More than the need to the body, and the knowledge of the account is more honorable than them, in view of the fact that the innocence of the knowledge of the account is stronger, but the knowledge of the origins is the one who is known to be the same, the same is the same and the same And the knowledge of the sections of the information is one of the enforcement and supplies, and there is no doubt that that is the honor of things, and the need for it is a hardship; Because the need is either in religion or in World, as for religion, tightening; Because those who know these things are the great reward and the right to the angels, and whoever ignores it, the great punishment is required and the right to the one who is in the authority of the people The world is only a perseverance with faith, mission, and immorality, if this faith did not get the fall of the ritual and the one in the world, and the power of the world, and the power of this It is obligatory to be a compound from the subjugation of a valuable, and it is the end in the power, so you have proven that this science is comprehensive on all the preachers It is obligatory to be honored by the sciences.Fifth: that this science does not divide the copying or alienated, and does not disagree with the disagreement of the nations and the aspects of the disagreement of the paths of the sciences, so it is obligatory to be.And its sixth: that the verses that are included in the demands of this science and their insights are honored by the verses that are denounced by the students of jurisprudence with the same way that he came in the virtue of the And the Messenger [Al -Qarah: 285] and the Kerisi, did not come like him in the virtue of his saying: They ask you about the menstruation [the cow: 222] Believe if you redeem you with a debt [Al -Baqara: 282] and that indicates that this science is better.And the sequence of them: that the verses mentioned in the legal rulings are less than the fulfillment of a verse.Al -Wajdah in the stories, so what is meant by the knowledge of the ruling of God is the Almighty and his ability to what he said: He was in their stories a lesson for the first of the doors: This science is better, and we refer to the significance The costs and the creation of those before them, the creation of the sky and the creation (P-81) is the earth, and the creation of the fruits from the water coming from the sky to the earth, and everything that was mentioned in the Qur’an from the miracle of the heavens, What is meant by that is, and the one who indicates the attributes.As for science, he said: God is not hidden from him in the earth, nor in the sky, and then he added it with his saying: He is the one who depicts you in the wombs, how is it: The eyes of the speakers are the eyes of the speakers, so they infer the rulings of the verbs and their mastery of the knowledge of the laws.A scholar of things, and he said: Does he not know who created and he is the gentle expert [the king: 14] and he is the eye of that significance and said: And he has the flames of the unseen, and he does not know that [59] On the authority of his knowledge of all information; Because it is an expert on the absence, so that it will fall The things are on the authority of that news, and if not for it, it is a scholar of the absences, otherwise it would not have occurred, and the description of the capacity is all that mentioned the rituals of the ritual And the different animals with the entirety of all in the fourth medicine, and that indicates that it is a fierce, not obligatory, not required, and as for the time With a body, or in the place of his saying: Say: God is one of the ride, the compound is a lack of its parts and the needy is an event, and if it is one, it is not necessary for it to be a body, and if it is not a body, and if it is not a body, and if it is not a body, and if it is not a body, and if it is not.The place, and the neutrality is that he said: If there were deities except God, they would spoil them and [the Prophet: 22] his saying: So he would not be able to seek to the one: 42] And he said: Perhaps some of them are on some [the believers: 91] As for the prophecy, he who indicates that he said: If you are in us, then we are in the Lord of us.In a wall of his example [Al -Baqara: 23] As for the re -said: Say: He greets it, which was created first time [Yass: 79] and if you did not know the knowledge of the words This indication of this is indicative and the volatility of it and the payment of the obedience and the stained youth in it, I believe that the knowledge of the words is vilified for its insults on this evidence or the one who is the same To show it to pay the obedience and the pnots from this evidence?What I see is a Muslim sane person who says that and satisfies him.And the second: that God Almighty narrated the recipient of this indicative of the angels and the most prophets, but the angels are because they said: “Do you make it in it.” What is meant is that the creation of such a thing is a tribute, and the wise does not do the cubic, so God Almighty answered them with his saying: I know what you do not know and the one who knows that I am not aware of what The information I had learned in their creation and their formation is a wisdom that you do not know, and there is no doubt that this is the view, and the view of God is the best of God Dahir, and the Prophet, peace be upon them, is the first of them.The recipient, and as for the Prophet, peace be upon him, God has told the disbelievers their saying: They said: “We have been brought up, so we have multiplied our new ones [32] There was no jurisprudence in the convergence of the laws, but it was in the neutrality and the prophecy, so the argument in the victory of the right in this science is the craft of the prophets, and the authority of the Prophet, So the exclusion in the explanation of his reforms in this section is lengthened and has positions: one of them: with his soul and he said: When he came to him, he said: I love the twins [Al -Anam: 76] and this is the way of speaking in The reciprocate of its change in its resurrection, then God Almighty praised him for that, so he said: And that is our pilgrimage that we have come to the authority of the people of it (82) (82) His father while he said: Oh, do not worship what he does not hear, does not see, and does not enrich anything from you [Maryam: 42].And the third of it: his condition with his people is a saying by saying and is the other in the verb, but by saying, he said: What is this are the two of the ones that you have: By doing, he said it: He made them a great way except for them, so that they may have them to return [Al -Anbiya: 58].And his booster: his condition with the king of his time in his saying: My Lord who revives and dies, he said: I will revive and I have been illuminated [the cow: 258] The knowledge of the words is that this is not the same as the evidence and the payment of the questions and the oppositions about it, so this is all the search for the peace be upon him in the beginning, and the one who said: Lord, how does the Mutti live [Al -Baqarah: 260] to the last, and as for Moses, peace be upon him, looked at his view with Pharaoh in Al -Tuhid and Al -Nabi Moses, peace be upon him, is dependent on the most important matter on the evidence of His Highness, peace be upon him.And that is because God Almighty said in Surah Taha: He said: Whoever is your Lord, O M and our Lord, who gave everything that he created and then guided [Taha: 49, 50] and this is the Dalil, Peace in his saying: He who created me, and he guides [the poets: 78] and he said in the surah of the poets, your Lord and the Lord of your parents, the first of the poet He lives and dies [the cow: 258].When he was not satisfied with Pharaoh with this and demanded it with something else, Moses said: The Lord of the Mashriq and the Maghrib [Al -Shua’ar: 28] Holding this indicative of these informants, and that they as they benefited from their minds, so they inherited it from their ancestors of the purified, and the one who is the one The prophecy of miracle in his saying: If I came to you with something clear, and this is the one who is the miracle of the honesty, and the blessings of God and the peace be upon him.With the signs of the neutrality, the prophecy, and the restoration is more appropriate than that it is needed in it, for the Qur’an is full of it, and it was upon him, and peace be upon him.The infidels.The first is: the foreground that was saying: What is destroyed except the foreground [Al -Jathiya: 24], and God is the Head of their saying with the types of evidence.The second: Those who deny the deceased Qadir, and God Almighty has shed their saying with the edge of the types of plants and the types of animals with all the partnerships of all in the kindness On the existence of Qadr.And the third: Those who have proven a partner with God Almighty, and that partner is either to be high Or a lower, as for the high -ranking partners, the same is the one who made the cries influenced in this world, and God Almighty has its heroes with the vicinity [Al -Awam: 76] As for the lower partners, the Christians said with the distraction of the Christ, and the worship of the second said with the etiquette, and God Almighty is more than the evidence.The lord: Those who stabbed in the prophethood while they are two jurisprudence: one of them: Those who stabbed in the origin of the prophecy and who are those who told them that they said: 94].And the second: Those who gave the origin of the prophecy and stabbed in the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ, and they are the Jews and the Christians, and the Qur’an is full of response to them, then they are from them By stabbing in the Qur’an, God answered with his saying: God is not ashamed to strike for example a mosquito [Al-Baqara: 26] and a time by seeking a wicked man (p-83) (P-83) And they said, We will not believe for you until you have been triggered from the earth to be wrapped up [Al -Israa: 90], and that this Qur’an has descended, and this is a result, and that is the same, and that is the same God Almighty said: Likewise, we will prove your heart [Al -Furqan: 32].Fifth: Those who have been disputed in al -Hash al -Hash and al -Shahir, and God is the highest of the health of that and on the heights of the saying of those who denounced many kinds of evidence.The sixth: Those who stabbed in the mandate that he is not excessive in it, and God answered him with his saying: If you do well, you will be well.The truth is the mighty, and that it contradicts the validity of the mandate, and God has answered the Almighty that he does not ask what he does while they are asking [the prophets: 23], but we are satisfied with this.Because the exclusion in it is mentioned in the sentence of this book, and if it is proven that this craft is the letter of all the prophets and the messengers, we know that the one who is the one who is in it is unaware.* * * Either it is permissible to imitate everyone, then we are obligated to imitate the infidels, or that some must be imitated without some, then it is necessary for the man to become a man with a maximum.Without some, it is not possible for him to have a path that he did not imitate one of them without the other, or that it is not permissible to imitate in the first This is the theoretical way.As for the one who is transmitted, the verses and the news are indicated.What is meant by his saying: the wisdom; That is, the proof And the argument, so the invitation was with the argument and the proof of God, the Almighty, commanded by it.And his saying: And they argued with them that is the best of what is meant by the argument in the law of the law; Because whoever denies his prophethood, there is no extensive in the mandate with him in the separation of the law, and whoever proves his prophethood, then he does not violate him, so he knows that this is the good And the prophecy, so the newness was in which it was commanded, then we are commanded to follow it - peace be upon him - for his saying: So follow me, and God will love you: 31 You have been for you in the Messenger of God, a good settlement [Al -Ahzab: 21], so we are obliged to be commanded by that chair.And the second: It is the saying of the Almighty: And among the people who argue with God without knowledge [Hajj: 3, 8, Lamman: 20], whoever argues in God is not the knowledge of God It will be a slander, but it will be emerging, and also God said that he is on the authority of Noah in his saying: They said: “We have argued, and we have multiplied.” [32] And the third of it: God Almighty commanded the look and said: Do they not manage the Qur’an [Women: 82]?[Chapter: 53], I did not see that we came to the ground, we decrease it from its frames [Thunder: 41], say: Look at what in the heavens and the earth [Yunus: 10], they did not look at the king of the heavens.[Al -A'raf: 185] And its elevation: that God Almighty mentioned the thinking in the presentation of the praise, and he said: That is in that, for the first of the doors [Al -Zumar: 21], that in that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first.There are verses of the first of the prohibition (P-84) [Taha: 54, 128], and also the defamation of the displaced and he said: As well The hearts they do not agree with [Al -A'raf: 179].Fifth: He is the Almighty to imitate, and he said a story about the infidels: Likewise, what we sent before you in a village from a vow [Al -Zukhruf: 23], and he said: 21], and he said: Rather, our fathers found us, as well as they do [Al -Shuaraa: 74], and he said: If he would almost mislead us from our family, if not for us to be patient with it [Al -Furqan: 42], and he said: You did not die for your deeds and migrant me, and all of that indicates the path of view, the reciprocate, thinking, and vilification The Qur’an and the religion of the prophets, and whoever calls for the consequences of the Qur’an and the Qur’an and the agreement of the religion of the infidels.As for the news, it is a lot, and let us remember from it.If my wife put a smooth boy, he said to him: Do you have a camel?He said: Yes, he said: What is her color?He said: Red, he said: Is there any of them?He said: Yes.He said: So that?He said: Perhaps it would have been distracted by an in Iraq.Know that this is the adherence to commitment and measurement.And secondly: On the authority of Abu Hurairah, he said: “He said - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -:“ God Almighty said: The son of Adam lied to me, and he did not have to lie to me, and he did not.As for his lies, I said it: He will not return me as it is necessary, and the first creation of his creation is to me from me from his return God is one of the fasting, and I did not give birth to me, and I did not have a sufficient for me.The second was brought up with the one with the negation of the body, the parents, and the state.And the third of it: the servants of the son of the silence narrated that he - peace be upon him - said: “Whoever loves the meeting of God will love God for his meeting, and whoever hates him to protect God, He will be rewarded for God.” God, we have been disturbed by the death, so our freedoms are for the meeting of God?So he said - peace be upon him - But the believer loved the meeting of God, so he loved God for his meeting, and the infidel is his hatred for the meeting of God, so God thought for His meeting with His meeting.* * * Know that the characteristic has positions: one of them: that the view does not benefit the science.And the second: that the beneficial view of knowledge is not able.And the third: that it is not permissible to come to it.And he paired it: The Messenger is what he commanded.Fifth: It is a bid.As for the first place: the summary took place upon him with matters: one of them: if we think and get a mind to us, our thoughts are a certainty, so do not know that you are the one who knows that Durbed or looking, and the first is false, because if a human being contemplated in his belief in the being of that belief, he is knowledgeable, and in his intention that the one is half of the two, and that the one is the same Little, and the fire is burning, and the first found weakened from the second, and that indicates that the weakness is made to the first and the second is false; Because the words are in that second thought, such as the words in the first, then the sectarianism is obligatory while it is referred.(P-85) and the second: We saw a world of people, you thought, worked hard, and they have a punishment for them, and they were a certainty, and they were asserted that it is the knowledge That was ignorant, so they returned from it and left it, and if we witnessed that in the first time, it is permissible for the sake of the second to be the second, and on this way, it is not the same.Among the heads that benefit from thought and view.And the third of it: that the one who is required, if it is a sense of his request; Because you have a referred to the habit, and if it is not a feeling of it, it was The mind is unaware of it, and the forgiven of it is impossible for the students to turn to it.And its elevation: that the knowledge is that the view is beneficial to the knowledge, either to be a harmful or a view, then if it is a warning, then the minds of the mind must be in it, and it is like it.And if it is a view, it is necessary to proof of the sex of the thing with an individuality of its individuals, and that is referred; Because the conflict when it was located in the wipedah was located in that individual, too, so it is necessary to prove something with itself, and it is referred; Because it is where the means of confusion must be known before, and from where it is required, it is obligatory that it is not known before, so it is a reason, and it is necessary to do so.Reasonable.Fifth: that the one presentation does not produce, but the producer is the two of the presenter, but the presence of the submitted one is one in the same way.Because we have raised themselves, then we found that when the righteous directed us, we are a science that is embarrassed in that time, and we will find it.Looking at the sentence benefits the science, but it says: The view in the divine is not beneficial, and it is transmitted to it by two John: The first: that the truth of God is the right The truth is perceived, as it is true, not by its confirmation, nor by the evidence of a row of his attributes.The first Bayan is that the knowledgeable with the human being is the fact that the existence is required from the bias and the face, and its universe is described by knowledge and capacity.As for the obligatory and the embarrassment, it is a negative restriction, and it is not the same as this negative.The science was not the same as the knowledge of its truth, and the mystical is with knowledge and capacity, it is a expressions of the same and the same as the same and the same.Affiliation, the knowledge of this affiliation is not a knowledge of it.The second is that belief is eager to perceive, so if the perception is valued, he is forbidden to believe, and it is not said: itself is up to the Almighty, even if it is not a man The special for which it has been visible on the basis of its balance; I mean that we know that it is something, which is obligatory, the obligatory and the righteousness, and it will be judged by this consequence, we said: These are the things that are known: It is referred, or things that are outside the self, so when we did not know the selfs, we cannot know that it is described by this characteristic, for if it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the condition These attributes to itself are also a perception of other attributes, so that the speech is in it as in the first, so the seed is obligatory, and it is referred.The second face: that the things showed us with our own and our right to which we are pronounced by saying: I am.Then the people are confused about what is referred to as a saying: I am, so whoever says: It is this structure, and among them is those who say: it is the mood, and among them is the one who says: some of the parts: The inside in this structure, and among them is those who say: something that is not within this body or its outside, then if the situation is in the appearance of things like that, then what you think is the most important of us.(P-86) As for the second place: that the beneficial view of knowledge is not possible for us, they were broken upon him with Jajah: one of them: that you will be the same.The constant beliefs are not able, so all beliefs are not able, but we said: The perceptions are not able; Because he asked her if she is disobeying her, asking her to ask for her to obtain the arrival of the one who is referred to it, then if he is unaware of it, it is impossible for it to be a request for it, because it is a request for it, because it is a request for it, because it is a request for it.Be a student.If it was said: Why is it not permissible for it to be known from a face and angry from the face?We said: Because the face that believes is that it is a knowledgeable, other than the face who is true to him that it is not known, otherwise the one who believes the righteousness The one is referred, and then we say: the knowledgeable direction is ashamed of his request for a chain of transmission, and the face, which is not known to be known.Because the disappearance of it is not required, but we said: The perceptions are when they were not like the custodian of the validity of the conflicts, and the beginning of the beginning, for the sake of the beginning, When the two parties of the mandate and the prohibited in the mind of the beginnings are either, it is necessary for the deceased of their presence to the reward of the mourning In the negative or not necessary, if it is not necessary, the case was not bodied, but it was doubtful.And if it is necessary, the belief was obligatory, then the two of you are the two, and the prohibitions of obtaining them at the time of their presence, and what is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be the same It will be a negative and angry that must also be, as well, so you have proven that the beginnings of the beginnings are not an offensive; Rather, we said: This is the beliefs when it was not a lipstick, and there was nothing of confirmation as a cable; Because the belief that is not alternative is inevitable and that it is a view, so they do not leave either that it is obligatory to be obligatory when the presence of that is not the believing, not the believing, not the believing, not the beliefs, not the beliefs, or not.If it was not obligatory for it, it was not necessary for those present.Issue, and if it is obligatory, these theories were the answer of the rituals, negative and proven with those fierce issues, so it is necessary that there is nothing It is based on the worshiper origin.And the second: that the human being will be able to enter the thing in the existence, even if he could have distinguished that aspiration from others, and the knowledge is that Ignorance of its formation is a way for the knowledgeable without ignorance, but it is known that if the knowledgeable knows about what is on it, then it is not possible for you to find it With that thing, but that is a referral for the argument of the harsh, so the servant should not be able to find the science or his request.And the third: that the obligatory is to look, either the harm of the mind, the view, or the hearing.The first is invalid because the fierce did not involve the mind in it, and the thought of thought and view is not like that, but many of the mind It is required with his owner to ignorance, so he is obliged to do so.The second is also false; Because if the knowledge is with his paths, it will be a view, then it is not possible to know it with the duty of the view before the view, so it is not possible, so it is not possible, so that it will not be done.As for after looking, it is not possible to look; Because there is no more in it.The third is false; Because before the view, it is not able to know the path of the view, and after the look, it cannot be positive, too, because of the goodness, and if the sections are not Group.* * * The third place: which is that the ability of the view is beneficial to the knowledge and a destiny for the cost, but it is the one who saves it from God, and it is the one who commands it.One of them: that the view in the most matter is the same as its owner to the ignorance, so the presenter is presented to it is presented to something that leads to it mostly to ignorance.And what is like that will be a ugly, so the thought (P-87) is ugly, and God Almighty does not command the ugly.And the second: that the one is among us with what is on the shortage and the weakening of the kidnapper and the many of the incompatible networks, it is not permissible for him to baptize in the mind of the mind And falsehood.When we saw the dignity of the doctrine, each one of them claims that the truth is with it, and that the falsehood is with its characteristic, then if you leave the fanaticism and the sacrifice, and they will be described, and they are.It is indicated by the mind of the mind from the realization of these facts.And the third of it: that the debt of religion, even if it was in view of the evidence of evidence, would not have to be able to believe in faith one hour; Because the one who looks at him, if he is a question, is a question from the submission of the debt of religion, then it became because of that question a complaint in that progress, and if it became a matter Doubt in which the result has become a thought; Because the two believers do not benefit the juice, it is necessary for the human being to come out every hour of religion by all that is dangerous with the questions and permissible.And he paid it: that he was defamed in the Sunnah that those who demanded money in the cimids are the same, and whoever asks the debt with the words will be tied, and that is indicated that it is not permissible.The loyal place: that It is estimated that it is in itself, so it is not the ugliness Knowledge, with its evidence, is a fierce science, which is rich in learning and benefiting, or that it is not like that, but it is brought in its acquisition of reflection, and the perpetrator, Otherwise, it is necessary for that to all people, and it is an arrogant, and because we are tired of the smartest people in this science, so it cannot be obtained in the years of the two years In the professionalism and classification.And if the second is that this science does not get the knowledge of a person except after the intense practice and the many, and if the religion was based on it, it is not upon it.In the health of the man of the man, except after he asked him about these questions and tolerate him in the knowledge of this significance on the exclusion.And if the Messenger did that, he would not have been purified, and when he was not known - but the well -known is the one who is transmitted from him with the frequency that he was governing the peace of those who know that he did not know In it, something of that - we know that this is not considered in the validity of religion.If it is said: the knowledge of the domesticity of the indicators is a lot of minds, but it is needed for the expense of the payment of the questions and the answer to the youth, and that is in the right Religion, our saying: This is weak; Because the evidence does not accept the leadership and the decrease, and that is because the evidence is if it was built on the tenths of ten, then if the man is a certainty, then the man is a valid.Knowing the evidence is known to be the same as it; Because the increase in that twenty, if it is considered to be in the realization of that indicative, the heroic of our saying: that indicative is a ride from the tenth, and it is not the same.The knowledge of it is a knowledge of the increase in something in the evidence, but it is a separate knowledge.So you have proven that the evidence does not accept the leadership and does not accept the decree as well; Because a nine of it, if it was a certainty, was the adherent to the adherence to the pretext of being the one who is the one who is based on me, because the builder is on the suspicion, that the one who thinks that I think that the one who thinks is that I think that the one who thinks is that I think, So she proves that the evidence does not accept the leadership and the shortage, and it was invalidated by that question.His example: If a person sees a rain, raid, and a lightning after that the air was clear, he said: Glory be to God, so among the people who said: He said: With his evidence, and this is false, because it is a disobedience to God if he knows the evidence that that juice is inevitably, and then he knows that he will know The influencer in which God Almighty has.This is the second one, but it is upright, even if it is known for the same It is improved by the support of these limits to the astronomy and the stars, the patches and the obligatory cause.If he did not know that it was a temporary, it was a believer (P-88) for this second submitted from the same way, so it is a sign, so it will be the same.The builder is a condemnation, not to be met.* * * The fifth place: to say: Exaggeration by the knowledge of the words with a heresy, and the evidence is upon him the Qur’an, the news, the consensus, and the saying of the predecessor and the judgment.As for the Qur’an, the Almighty said: What they struck for you, but they are not the ones, but they are the people who are deaf [Al -Zukhruf: 58].They are going into a hadith other than it [Al -Anam: 68], they said: He commanded symptoms of them when they are in the verses of God Almighty.As for the news, his saying - peace be upon him -: “You think about creation and do not think about the Creator.The fate is mentioned, and they are held.As for the consensus, it is that this is a knowledge that the companions are not spoken in, so it is a heresy, so it will be forbidden, but that the companions do not speak to it.Because it was not transmitted from one of them that he set himself up to the recipient in these things, but they were one of the most denials of those who have been in it, and if this is proven, and if this is proven, and if this is proven, and if this is the same With a deprivation of agreement.As for the impact, Malik Bin Anas said: I will be innovated, it was said: What is the innovation, O Abu Abd Allah?He said: The people of the people who speak to the names of God and his words and his words and do not silence what the companions and followers have been silent about.Safyan ibn Ayen was asked about the words, and he said: Follow the Sunnah and leave the heresy.Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - said: Because God is the servant of all sins, except for the blessing, it is better for him to throw him with something of words.And he said: If a man is a man with his scientific books, there was a book in which the books of the words were not, and that books did not enter in the commandment.As for the judgment, it is that if it is a recommendation for the scholars, the speaker does not enter them, and God knows.This is the group of the words of the appellants in the view and the recipient.The answer: As for the similarity that they are held in that the view does not benefit the science, it is a corruption; Because the similarity that they mentioned is not a warning, but rather a view, so they preceded all the views of some of its types, and it is contradictory, and the similarity is that it is the same, and the suspicion is that it is.It is a pardoned place; Because they are chooses to seek that simile, their saying is invalidated: it is not a choice, and the similarity that they have been held in that the righteousness is on the authority of the Divide; Because it is obligatory for them to be their revenue for this likeness that they are in a ruggedness, and the similarity that they have touched in that the Messenger is what commanded That is, it is invalid; Because we have shown that the prophets with their families did not come except with the matter in the look and the recipient.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: What they have struck for you is only a grandfather.As for his saying: If you see those who are going into in our verses, then offer them [Al -Anam: 68], then his answer is that the action is not the view, but the ablution is in the authority of the The prayers and peace be upon him -: “You think about creation.” So that he commanded him to benefit from the knowledge of the Creator, which is the one who is required.As for his saying - peace and blessings be upon him -: “You have the religion of the wonders.As for his saying - peace and blessings be upon him -: “If the destiny is mentioned, then hold on.” Because the prohibited partiality does not benefit the complete prohibition.As for consensus, we say: If you mean that the companions did not use the conservative of the speakers, then a Muslim, but it is not necessary for him to be in the words of the words, as they are not.The jurisprudence, and there is no need for him in the jurisprudence, and if you mean that they did not recognize God, the Exalted and His Messenger with the same, then the misery of what you said, It is forbidden for the people of the heresy, and the question of the commandment is an opposition, since it is a recommended one who was known to God, his attributes, his deeds, and his deeds, and his deeds, and his deeds, and his deeds, and his deeds, and his reactions, Figure.Because the commander of the commandments (P-89) is on the known, this is the completion of this question.And God knows.* * * As for the creation, it was narrated by Al -Azhari, the owner of the “polishing” of Ibn Al -Anbari, that it is the ability and the level, and they embarrassed it with the verse, the poetry, and the righteousness, and the righteousness of the verse, The best of the creators [the believers: 14], that is, the estimated and created the dismantling [the spider: 17], that is, you are able to lie and when it is created from the clay [al -Ma’idah: 110], that is, it is estimated.As for the poetry, Zahir said: ؎ You are the one that you have created and the people of the people create, then he will not be spared, and another said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ As for the righteousness: it is said: the creation of the heart: if it is appreciated and equated by the measure, and from it the saying of the Arabs to the hadith that he does not believe in: The first creatures [poets: 137], and the creation: the one who is good, and it is created; Any new one, as if he is the creation, and the ethical rock: the weighted; Because in the smoothness, in the roughness, it is an elaboration and from it “the garment of the garment” because if it is a dress, it becomes the level Expression of stability and leveling, the judge, Abd al -Jabar, said: creation is a verb in the sense of estimation, and the language does not require that that is not the right of God With his difference in his saying: God bless you, the best of the creators [the believers: 14], and when you create the clay as the goodness With the righteousness and the sequence of reconciliation, and there is no action for it except that, there is no crime that was sealed with this name.And his father, Abu Abdullah Al -Basri, said: The release of the name “Khalqq” is referred to God; Because estimation and leveling is a phrase of thought, view and calculations, and that is in the right of God referred.The people of the Sunnah and the group said: Creation is a phrase of creation and creation, and they embarrassed him with the words of the Muslims: There is no devotion except for God, and if the creation was from the creation of the creation It is correct.* * * The third question: He knows that he is a matter of his servants, and the matter of his worshipers is standing on the knowledge Rather, I am not able, and there is no generosity that indicates its existence.And know that we have shown us in the “mental books” that the way to prove it is its grace and the exalted either the possibility, or the impermissibility, or their entirety, and all of you are either in Al -Jawah.So the group of the methods indicating that it will be granted and exalted, and six are more than more: one of them: the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The rich and you are the poor [Muhammad: 38], and by saying it is a story about Abraham: they are an enemy for me except the Lord of the two worlds [poets: 77], and his saying: And that to your Lord: 42] And his saying: Say God, then their atom [Al -Anam: 91], so flee to God [Al -Dharaiyat: 50], except with the remembrance of God, the hearts are reassured [Al -Raad: 28].And the second: the recipient of the adjectives, and the signal is by saying: the creation of the heavens and the earth and its saying: the one who has made you the land and the heavens of you Its report.And the third of it: the recipient of the edge of the bodies, and the signal is the saying of Abraham - peace be upon him -: I do not love the two people [Al -Anam: 76].And its elevation: the reciprocate of the sects of symptoms, and this is the way to the way to the understanding of creation, and that is counted in two things (P-90) the evidence of the soul The goddess in the most is the most common of these two chapters, and God Almighty has gathered here among these two directions.As for the souls of the soul, it is that every one knows the harm that it was not equipped before that, and that it is now a suppression, and that everything was found, then there is no one, so there is no And that found is not itself, the parents, nor the people of the people; Because the deficiency of creation is like this installation, known to be well, so it must be from A glorious person who violates these existences until it is correct to find these people, except that there is a saying that he says here: Why is it not permissible for the influencer to be the one And the stars?And when this question was an improper, God mentioned the Almighty, what indicates the lack of these things to the modern and the found, and he said: He who has made it to you What is meant by the evidence of horizons, and all the things that are found from the worlds of the world, the lightning, the wind, the clouds, and the disagreement of the chapters, and the ones who are returned to the sake of the world.Ansariya is partner in generosity, so some of them are made with some attributes from the quantities, forms, and bias, and it cannot be for the body.Otherwise, all of these attributes must be bought, so it is necessary for it to be a matter of separation, and that matter if it is a body, the search is that it is not the one who was sealed by the one who is the one The bodies, and if it is not a body, it is either a duty or a choice.The first is false, otherwise it was not the choice of some bodies with some attributes, the first of the opposite, then it is necessary to be a capacity, so you have proven to this connotation to the connotation Qadir is not in the body, or by my body, and when this appeared that the recipient of the symptoms are the ones on the existence of the chants, it is not enough after the abuse and the symptoms.And if you know this, then say: God is exalted, but he summarized this type from the evidence of revenue at the beginning of his book to Jajin: The first: that this is the way to the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was And the adherence to the minds, and the evidence is mentioned in the Qur’an, it must be far from accuracy and bring it closer to the understanding, so that it can be intended for it.God mentioned the highest in his first book.The second: It is not the abuse of the guidance of the Quranic evidence, but the abuse of it is the case of the right to the hearts in the hearts, and this is the most powerful of the signs of the sins of the sins of this.The door; Because this type is of evidence, as it is beneficial to the existence of the creator, it is mentioned by the blessings of the Creator to us, because the existence and life of the blessing of the grace, It is obligatory to love and leave the dispute and the acquisition of the purpose, for this reason was the remembrance of this type of evidence or the first of the types of types.He knew that the scourge is a gentle way in this section: one of them: it is narrated that some of the trends were denied that the chain of transmission is when Jaafar al -Sadiq - may God be pleased with him - is the one who said: Did you ride the sea?He said: Yes.He said: Did you see his horrors?He said: Yes; A huge day was hidden, and the travel was broken and the swimmers were drowned, so I got stuck with some of its eyes then That is gone from me, so if I am buried in the talisman of the waves until I was driven to the coast, so Jaafar said: You have been bound by before the shed Until you save you, when these things went away from you, did you surrender to your soul, or did you hope that peace after?He said: Rather, I hope for peace, he said: Who were you hoped for?The man silenced, and Jaafar said: The facts are the one who was hoping for that time, which is (P-91) who has saved you from the place, so the man did not.And the second: He came in the book “The Danish of the Arabs” that the Prophet ﷺ said to Amr bin Bin Hawin: “How much do you have God?” He said: Ten, he said: Whoever is your clouds and your hearts and pay the great matter if he descends from you from their sentences?And the third of it: Abu Hanifa - may God have mercy on him - was a sword on the forefront, and they were shaking the firmness to kill him, so between him on the day of the mosque, he is a prostitute.With a hook, they were killed by his killing, and he said to them: They answered me about a question, then do what you wanted, so they said to him: Hat, so he said: What do you say: Sufficiency is watered by the nodes, full of weights, which have been broken in the latter of the sea.A weapon that he runs and a citizen who pushes it, is that permissible in the mind?They said: No, this is something that the mind does not accept?And Abu Hanifa said: Oh, Glory be to God, if it is not permissible in the mind, a ship that runs in the sea, equal to the one who is not a manifestation or a course, so how is it permissible.Its conditions, its sinks, their stretching, and the extent of their cuffs, are not subject to a preservative?They cried all and said: You believed, and they were clouded, and they repented.And its elevation: They asked Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - what is the evidence of the existence of the chain of transmission?He said: The charity of the meteorology is its food, its color, its wind, and its bowls, and one of you with you?They said: Yes, he said: So the bondage of sazat will eat it, and the innocent comes out of it, and the beekeeper will come out, and the honey comes out of it, and the sheep will come out of it, and it will be broken from it.We have the musk, so who has made these things like that with the one that is one?So be improved from him and became Muslim on his hand, and their number was seven ten.Fifth: Abu Hanifa was asked - may God be pleased with him - once, so he touched that the father wants the male, so he will be a female and the opposite, so he referred.And its sixth: Ahmad ibn Hanbul - may God be pleased with him - has been trapped by a fabric of a fortified fortress, not a vine The grandmother and came out of the castle is an obstacle, so it is necessary With the white fox and the spatial animal.And the seven of it: Harun al -Rashid asked Malik about that, and he was inferred by the choice of voices, the repeat of the tones, and the absence of languages.And eighth: Abu Nawas was asked about it, so he said: “He contemplated the plant of the earth and looks at the effects of what the Mecal made ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ and the flowers ∗∗∗ and the flowers of the sake of the sake of the sake The Zabraj is witnesses ∗∗∗ that God does not have your partners and its ninth: an Arab was asked about the evidence, so he said: The camel is indicative of the camel.And the height on the red, and the effects of feet on the path, a sky with a horoscope and the earth with chickens and seas with waves, but it indicates the generous, generous, knowledgeable?(P-92) And I adore it: It was said to Tabib: What did you know your Lord?He said: With a dried manner, I will be released, and for a boring saliva.And another said: I knew it with a solution, with one of its two sides, it is sorry, and the other is stingy, and the honey is the heart of the sting.And its twelve: the ruling of the beginning in his saying: And if you asked them who created them, they would say to God [Al -Zukhruf: 87], and when they saw us, they said: It is involved [Ghafir: 84].* * * The following question: Al -Qadi said: Al -Feda is in his saying: He who created you that worship is only worthy The worship is obligatory.If it was said: What is the benefit is in his saying: Those who are before you and the creation of God from those before them does not require that worship be upon them, and we say: On what you mentioned, but their knowledge is that God Almighty created them as their knowledge that he was the Heavy man who created those before them because the way of knowledge is one.The second: that those who accepted them are like the origins of them, and the origins of the prayers run the path of the public on the righteousness, as if it is a great remembrance of them, as it is the greatness of it, as if it is a great person, as if it is, as if it is, as if it is, it is not.I was only blessed with you when I found, but I was blessed before you were found with the thousands of years because I was an empty of your family and your parents.The fifth question: In his words, the Exalted: Perhaps you will fear the sacrifices: the first search: that the word (perhaps) is for the translation and the agreement, and you say: Perhaps he remembers or fears [Taha: 44], perhaps the hour is close [Al -Shura: 17], not to see it to say: and those who believed in disgusting from it [Al -Shura: 18] When ignorance of the punishment, and that is upon God, a referred exalted, so there must be from the interpretation of it, and it is from the faces: one of them: that the meaning of God is to God, not to God, not to God.Perhaps he remembers or fears [Taha: 44] that is, he gave it to your hope and you will be in his faith.And the second: It is the usual of the darkest and the greatness that they confront their dates that are involved Its achievement is based on saying: Perhaps and may God bless them with words, or to inform them of the symbol or the smile or the theory of sweetness, then if it is affected by something The student remains a doubt in the winner, so on this way and responded to (perhaps) in the words of God Almighty.And the third of it: What was said that (perhaps) in the sense of (Ke), the owner of the “scout” said: And (perhaps) is not in the sense of (Ke), but it is a word (may God) for the sake of God.It is reassured in it, there is no way, and it will be done by the course of the course of its implicit And the one who was upset: that he did the costs of the costs, if he did other than him, he would have required the hope of the intention of the intended; Because he was exalted when they gave them the ability for good and evil and created for them the guidance of the guidance and removed their excuses, so everyone who did otherwise, so that he is from it What is meant is a word (perhaps), so he did what if he did other than him, it was obligatory for the hope.Fifth: Al -Qafal said: (Perhaps) is taken from the repetition of the thing as their saying: the highest after a lap, and the imam in it is the mother of affirmation as the one who is in the way So the origin (per)); Because they say: You have to do so, that is, perhaps you, then if it is his right to repeat and affirmation, he said: Do you do so, so do so, so that you may be so.Do it, for your action for him will confirm your request for him and strengthen you.The second research: that there is a saying that he says: If the worship is strengthened, then his saying: (Sect your Lord, so that you may fear) You worship.Or: Fear your Lord, that you may fear, and the answer is from two sides: the first: (p-93) We do not surrender that worship is the soul of piety, but the worship is a verb.Because the meeting is the unparalleled of harmony, and worship is the act of those who are afflicted with it, and the soul of this verb is not the same as the one who is the one who is the one who does not say, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is necessary, but it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not.Worship your Lord to be conquered by his punishment, and if it was said in the same verb: it is a meeting; That is a metaphor; Because the meeting is not what the meeting gets, but to contact one of the two things by the other, its name is running on it.The second: It is upset, but it created the costs of you to fear and obey what he said: I did not create heaven and humanity except to worship [Al -Dahariyat: 56], as if he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is up to the one who is They created them for this exhibition, and this interpretation is appropriate to the origins of the disgrace.* * * The sixth question: Abu Amr read: (He created you) with slurring, and Abu Al -Sama’a read: (And he created those before you) and read Zaid ibn al -Ali: The owner of the scout said: The face is in it that he broke the second connector between the first, and he was affirming him, as he was sacked in his saying: The second day is between the first and what was added to it.
