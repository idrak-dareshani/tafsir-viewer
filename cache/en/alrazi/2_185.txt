The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: the month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed to people and evidence of guidance and difference, so whoever has witnessed the month of you, and whoever is the one who is a person, and whoever is happy A number of last days, God wants you to the secret, and the hardships want you, and to complete the number, and to grow up to God for what guides you, and may God bless you The first: the month is taken from the month, it is said, the month of the thing is a month and a month if it appears, and the month was called a month of the month of his matter, and that is because the people of the people are not Its knowledge is due to the concerns of their debts, and the elimination of their humanity in their fast and their argument, and the month is the appearance of something and the crescent is a month.Some of them said the month was called a month in the name of the Crescent.* * * He said: “Do not say, Ramadan came and Ramadan went, but they said: The month of Ramadan came and the month of Ramadan went, so Ramadan is a name of God Almighty.” The second saying: It is a name for the month as a month of righteous and people, then they disagreed with his detection on his faces.It comes before the Khuraif, purifying the face of the land from the dust, and the meaning is that it is as washing that rain and the face of the earth and purifies it, so the month of the Ramadan is a month The nation of sins and purifies their hearts.The second: It is taken from the spear, and it is free from the severity of the sun, and the name is the word, so the name of this month is this name, either to the one who is the one who is in this name.The hardness of his intensity, as they called him a follower because he was following them, that is, he was disgusted to tighten him to them, and it was said: When they said the names of the Shahr al -Qaddah from the ritual With the mourning in which it was located, then this month is agreed upon the days of the freedom, and it was said: This name was called because it is the sins, that is, it is forbidden, and it is forbidden, and it will be burned.He said: “Rather, Ramadan was called because it is the sins of the servants of God.” The third: that this name is taken from their saying: I ran the basis of whipping, if it was paid between two wages, to shine, and we will be brightened, and the basis of this is a darkness.The month is Ramadan, because they were threatening their weapons to spend from them, and this saying is told about Al -Azhari.The lord: If their saying is true: The Ramadan is the name of God Almighty, and this month is also called this name.This month is also Ramadan, in the sense that sins are buried on the side of his blessing.The third question: Reading (Monor) by lifting and with the setting, but the raising is in his faces: one of them: it is the saying of the Kasayi that he raised the exile from fasting, and the meaning: the meaning of you.The second: It is the saying of the darkening and the fear that it is (P-72) a beginner that is deleted with a substitute from his saying: (days) as if it was said: It is the month of Ramadan, because it is a month of Ramadan, because he said: Interpretation of the imams of the numbers and showing them.The third: Abu Ali said: If you have made it a beginner, the news is deleted, as if it was when you have been written on you, the fast was said: What is the fast of the fast Fasting.Al -Rabaa: Some of them said: It is permissible for it to be a beginner and his informing (the one who) with his prayer, as his saying is the increase of the one who is in the house.Abu Ali said: It is more like that it is (the one) and a description to be the Qur’an, a text in the matter of the month His fasting with this memorization, but it is an expert from him by removing the Qur’an in it, and also if you make (the one who) and a description of the right of the arrogance to be from the one who is the one who is not from The blessed month of Ramadan, whoever witnessed it, may fast it.As for the reading of the monument, it is in its faces: one of them: the stability: they were fasting the month of Ramadan.And the second: for exemptions from numbers.And the third of it: it is an act and to fast, and this face was mentioned by the owner of the “scout” and he was subjected to it that it was said: He said this is the destiny of the one who is the opposite: The Qur’an is better for you, and this requires the chapter falling between the beginning and the news of this many words, and it is not permissible because it is not permissible because the one is the one who is the one who is the one The one and the rhythm of the chapter between the thing and between itself, it is not permissible.* * * As for his saying: The Qur’an is revealed in it, I know that it is up to what this month summarized with this worship between the reason for this specialization, and it is that it is the specialty, and it is that it is the specialty, With the great verses of the raptula, which is that the Qur’an was revealed in it, so it is not distant from the great means The steadfast lights are emerging, which is obeyed by hidden and admired, but the human beings are prevented from its appearance in the human signs, and the strongest of the causes is the most powerful Hosary, and that is, for the people of the disclosures have no way to reach it except by fasting, and for this he said - peace and blessings be upon him -: “If only the one who does not The children of Adam to look at the kingdom of the heavens.It will be specialized in fasting, and in this position there are many secrets and the destiny that we have seen enough for us, and then here are the questions: The first question: His Excellency said: It is revealed in it the Qur’an in its interpretation of the saying: The first: It is the choice of the gathering: that God Almighty has revealed the Qur’an in the Qur’an: “The newspapers of Abraham descended on the first night of Ramadan, and the mortar was revealed to a long time, and the Glory of the twelve and the Qur’an for the fourth of the people.” The first question: The Qur’an is what was revealed to Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - a motivation, but he was revealed to him in the period of three and twelve years, and a year In Ramadan, some of it came down in the brightest of the Shahr, so what is the meaning of its landing with Ramadan?And the answer to it from two faces: The first: that the Qur’an was revealed at the night of the destiny, a sentence to the sky of the world, then he went down to the earth as a stars, but the situation was running on this The reconciliation is on this direction, for it is no longer that the angels who are the population of the world of the world are a reconciliation in the landing of that to them or if you are in them.Reconciliation to the Messenger - peace be upon him - in the signature of the neighborhood from the closest buds, or if there is a reconciliation for Jabril, peace be upon him, because he was the one And its performance, but the rule in the removal of the Qur’an on the Messenger is a separate separation, we have explained it in (P-73) Surah al-Farqan in the interpretation of the saying of the one who said: Excitement, if not for the Qur’an, one sentence was revealed to him, as well as your hearts, for your heart [Al -Furqan: 32].The second answer to this question: that what is meant by it is that its removal is the night of the fate of the month of Ramadan, which is the saying of Muhammad ibn Ishaq, and that is because it is the one It is dated to her to be the honor of the leaflets, and because they are also known.And know that the first answer does not need it to carry something of the metaphor, and we need it, because it is necessary for this answer to the Qur’an to the Qur’an.The second question: How is the collection between this verse on this saying, and between its words, the Almighty: We have revealed it on the night of the destiny [destiny: 1] and between the saying of it: Smart [smoke: 3].The answer: It was narrated that Ibn Omar was inferred by this verse and his saying: We have sent him down on the night of destiny that the night of the destiny is necessary and that it will be in Ramadan It was in Ramadan, his removal was on the night of destiny in Ramadan, and this is the same as saying: I did so and so in this month, and he will be said to him: On any day, then he says that he says In interpretation of the first words, so we are.The third question: that the Qur’an is on this saying that it is said that God Almighty has revealed all the Qur’an from the urged to the glory of the world in Lalla ﷺ It is stolen to the last age, and it is also to be said to be said: He was granted to him, he was descending from the broken wave to the worldly sky - the Qur’an - what he knows - And his nation needs him in that year, then he will be revealed to the Messenger on the destiny of the need, then as long as they are ever, as long as they are close to right?الجَوابُ: كِلاهُما مُحْتَمَلٌ, وذَلِكَ لِأنَّ قَوْلَهُ: شَهْرُ رَمَضانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ القُرْآنُ يُحْتَمَلُ أنْ يَكُونَ المُرادُ مِنهُ الشَّخْصَ, وهو رَمَضانُ مُعَيَّنٌ, وأنْ يَكُونَ المُرادُ From it the type, and if each one of them is a good, it is necessary to stop.The second saying: In the interpretation of his saying: He descended from the Qur’an, Safyan ibn Uyaynah said: The Qur’an is revealed in it, and this is the same in the Qur’an The choice of Al -Husayn ibn al -Fadl said: And the same is to be said: I will be revealed in the friend as well as a verse; They want in his grace.Ibn al -Anbari said: He was revealed in the affirmation of his fast on the Qur’an, as he says: God revealed in zakat like this and so he wants in its positive and descended in the wine like this.* * * The second question: the Qur’an is a name for the two burials among the words of God, and they were dispersed in his detection, so the one narrated in “Al -Bassit” on the authority of Muhammad Ibn Al -Hakim.Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - was saying: The Qur’an is a name and is not a matter Rights, and the Qur’an does not pronounce as it says: If the Qur’an reads [Al -Israa: 45], Al -Wahidi said: And Al -Shafi’i said that it is a name for the book of God, that he will be the same.Others went to being derived, and he knew that those who say this saying from them who do not disgrace him and among them are those whom he is proud of, (P-74), but the first people are: It is taken from the village of the thing with something if you guarantee one to the other, then it is derived from a village and the name is the Qur’an that is not important, so the name of the Qur’an is from the Qur’an And the verses and the forefathers come together with each other, or because what is in it is judgment and the partnership, and the part of it is one, or because what is in it is the same It is settled by one another, I mean its detention on the flaws of the eloquence and on the strange styles, and on the news about the absences, and the many science The Qur’an and the name are the vertebra And secondly: Al -Farah said: I think that the Qur’an was named from the readers, and that is because the verses are believed by some of some of what he said: If it was from the one who is for the sake Many [Women: 82] They are readers, and those who have gave up are their faces: one of them: that it is the source I read it as a reader, reader, and Qur’an, as it is a source, and the same Qur’an is from the sources: the two risks, the two, the loss, and the forgiveness, the poet said: The prostration with it is cut off from the night and the Qur’an, that is, the readers, and God said His grace and the Almighty: The Qur’an was a martyr [Al -Israa: 78] Quran, because the verb is called the source, as they said to the drink: a drink and the book as a book, and this name is known in the norm until he made it.And the second: Al -Zajaj and Abu Ubaidah said: It is taken from the reciter, which is gathering.Amr said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ That is, she was not collected in her mercy, and from this origin: the woman is read, which is the days of bloodshed in her mercy, so the Qur’an is called a Qur’an, because it is the same.And the third of it: the saying of Qarib, which is that it was called a Qur’an, because the reader writes it, and when the readers are as if he throws it from it in it, taking from the saying of the Arab: That is, what was threw up in a child, and what she has fallen as a whole, and what she was hurt, and the menstruation was called a reciter for this interpretation, for the Quran is the reader, the reader is preserved from it.The third question: We have mentioned the interpretation of his saying: If you are in a rapper of what we have revealed to our servants [Al -Baqarah: 23], that the descending is a misfortune.Training, and landing is specialized in what is the descent in which one payment is one, and this is why God Almighty said: The book is revealed to you with the truth, and the truth is from what is between him And the Gospel [Al -Imran: 3], if this is proven, then he says: What is meant is from the saying of the Almighty: the month of Ramadan in which the Qur’an was revealed to the Qur’an, from the time The world, there is no crime, mentioned by the removal of the landing without downloading, and this indicates that this saying is correct on the path of sayings.* * * As for his saying: a guidance for people, he has two issues: the first question: showing the interpretation of guidance in his saying: Haddah for the righteous [Al -Baqarah].The question is that he has made the Qur’an in that verse is guided by the righteous, and we made it a guidance for people, so how is the whole face?And his answer is what we mentioned there.The second question: a guidance for people and evidence that is erected in the case, that is, it was revealed, which is a guidance for people to the right, which is (P-75), vehicles, shrouded, which leads to the truth The right and falsehood.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Benate of guidance and difference, and it has a form, which is to be said: What is the meaning of his saying: Benate of guidance after his saying: (Hoda).His answer is from his faces: The first: He is the first to mention that it is a guidance, then the guidance is on two sections: Tara, it will be a guidance for the people, and there is no way, and there is no way to the people, The first section is not doubtful that it is better, as it was said: it is This is because it is the evidence from the guidance, and the separation between the truth and the falsehood, for this is a matter of what the gender is mentioned and its type is overwhelmed by it, so that it will be the honor of it.It was said: This is a guidance, and this is among the guidance, and this is evidence of guidance, and there is no doubt that this is the absence of the voids.The second: that it is said: The Qur’an is a guidance in itself, and with its being, as well, it is also evidence of guidance and the differences, and what is meant by the guidance and the difference: The book was revealed to you with the truth, sincerely between his hands, and the delegation and the evangelization came down before this guidance for people, and the differences were revealed [Al -Imran: 3] and he said: Perhaps you will be guided [Al -Baqarah: 53] and he said, “Moses and Harun Al -Furqan came to us and a male for the righteous [Al -Anbiya: 48], so he explained the Almighty and was sanctified that the Qur’an is with him.Its soul is also a gift from the advanced books that are guidance and a difference.The third: that the first be carried on the principles of religion, and the second guidance on the branch of religion, so that the relics and God know.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Whoever witnesses the month of you, let him fast, and he will be in his questions: They said: The fulfillment in his saying: Whoever has witnessed the month, let him fast it with an excess.For compassion.And the part is our face, and from the increase in fulfillment, the Almighty saying: Say that the death that you escape from it is that you will meet you, then you will be returned to the world of the unseen [Friday: 8].وأقُولُ: يُمْكِنُ أنْ يُقالَ الفاءُ هَهُنا لِلْجَزاءِ فَإنَّهُ تَعالى لَمّا بَيَّنَ كَوْنَ رَمَضانَ مُخْتَصًّا بِالفَضِيلَةِ العَظِيمَةِ الَّتِي لا يُشارِكُهُ سائِرُ الشُّهُورِ فِيها, فَبَيَّنَ أنَّ He sought it with that guidance that suits his choice with this worship, and if not for that would not have been for the sake of that of that guest, this is the same as if it is that it is a matter of this The month of this virtue is that you are also summarized by this worship, but the words of the Almighty: He is your meeting with you [Friday: 8], the fulfillment is that it is not necessary for it to be The opposite of the antagonist as if it was said: When they flew from the death, then they are unaware to bring the death closer to them to know that the warning does not enrich the destiny.* * * His house in the sense of it was not a traveling traveler, and his saying: (The month) is his injury to the custody, and so is the distraction in his saying: (Let him fast).And the second saying: the act of (witnessed) is (the month), and the ability: whoever witnessed the month with his mind and his knowledge, let him fast, and he is said: as it is said: So, so, And I know that both sayings are not fulfilled only by the advertiser of the apparent, but the first saying (P-76) is that it is fulfilled by the addition of an increase, and the one who says the second is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who says the second In the verse, and that is because the witnesses of the month have occurred in the right of the boy, the madman, the sick, and the traveler with the fact that it was not obligatory for one of them, the fast is that it is not in the fast.The conflict was made between specialization and guaranteeing, so specialization is first, and also because we are on the first saying, when the guarantee of the guarantee must also be of commitment to specialization; Because the boy, the madman, and the sick, each one of them witnessed the month with the fact that the fasting is not obligatory for them, but the traveler does not enter, so he does not need to be given to this The first saying does not walk except with the commitment of guaranteeing and specialization, and the second saying is walked with the extension of the commitment of specialization, so the second saying was for me More investigators, such as Al -Wahaidi and the owner of the “scout”, went to the first.The third question: the thousand and the blame in its saying: Whoever has witnessed the month of the precedent grace, which is the month of Ramadan, and his counterpart, the saying of God: Charity, when they did not come to the destruction [Al -Nur: 13], that is, when they did not come to the four.The following question: I know that in the verse a problem is that his saying is up to the Almighty: Whoever has witnessed the month of you, let him fast a sentence of a condition of a condition, and the condition of the condition, and the condition of the condition, It is the matter of fasting, and the condition is not found by his perfection, the part of which is not arranged, and the month is a name for the obligatory obligation from his first to the last of the last, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The last part of the month, and the appearance of this verse requires that the witnesses of the last part of the month must have the fast of the month of the month of the month of the month, because this is the one who is a matter The permissible time and it is forbidden, for this evidence is our knowledge that this verse can not be made on its appearance, and that it is necessary to be shown to the one who is notified, and it is not possible.The month is on part of the parts of the month in the side of the condition, so his decree becomes: whoever witnesses a part of the parts of the month, let him fast every month, so this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one He witnessed a part of the parts of the month, and the condition may be achieved, and the penalty arranged for him, which is the matter of every month, and on this one, and on this one, the one who does not seek.It is only a pregnancy to be kept on part, which is a famous metaphor.He knew that the one who is reported to me is that what is meant is from this verse, so whoever testifies from you the first month, let him fast all of it, and you have known what we have mentioned that the diligence is not.The saying, then he is separated from this origin, Faruan: One of them: if he witnesses the first month, It is obligatory for the fast of every month.The second: If the last month is witnessed, then the fasting of the whole month is required.As for the first: it is that he was transferred from Ali - may God be pleased with him - that whoever entered the month and is evaluated and then he traveled, that the duty is to fast, because the one who is the one who is the one who does not do that The first month was witnessed by the fast of the whole month, and the path of the Mujahids, and they say: If his saying is up to the Almighty: He who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from you, He witnessed the first month, so that all of him will fast, except that it is a year in which the present and the traveler enter, and he said after that: whoever is from you is sick or on the authority The private is presented over the year, and it has proven that, even if he traveled after the martyrs of the month, then it is permissible for him to break the fast.As for the second: that Abu Hanifa claimed that the madness, if he woke up in the same month, he is obligated to spend what he went on, he said: Because (P-77), we have indicated that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the meaning A part of Ramadan, his fast is required for all Ramadan, and the madness, if he woke up in the same month, then he witnessed a part of Ramadan, so he must be obligated to all of the fast.It is possible to fast what is presented, and the judiciary is obligatory.* * * Fifth question: Know that his saying is up to the Almighty: Whoever has witnessed from you the month, let him fast, so he calls two urbanization: the first search: We say: either with vision, or by reputation, but the vision is a saying: If a person sees a crescent of Ramadan, then he is an alienated with the same or not, if it is not, if it is not, if it is not, if it is not, if it is not, then it is not.It is alienated with it, but the imam responds to his martyrs or does not return it, for if you are unique in vision and the imam responded to his martyrs, then he is obligated to fast, for the sake of God.Because of the duty of fasting on him, and the witnesses of the month have obtained his right, so he must have to fast, and if he is unaware of the imam and the imam of the imam and the imam of the imam and the ritual He is disciplined with vision, so there is no words in the path of fasting.As for the hearing, it is said that if it witnesses the severity of the crescent, it is judged in the fast and the innate, and if a single justice witnesses the vision of the shamel, there is no shame.On the crescent of Ramadan, he will judge him in order to order the command of fasting, and the difference between it and between the crescent of Sala And the saying of the one in the proof of worship is accepted, but in the abandonment of worship, it is only accepted by the saying of the two, and that there is no difference between them in the truth.The one in the crescent of Ramadan is to fast and do not break the fast, so that the one said in the crescent of a shawl, so that they will fast and do not break.The second research in fast The breakfast with the knowledge of its form is one of the first ritual dawn until the sunset with the intention, and in the same time: One of them: If a flies would flee to his throat, or the dust of the way arrived to his stomach, his fast will not be drove; Because the bound by him is hard, and God is the Almighty who says in the verse of fasting: God wants you to the secret and does not want the hardship to you.The second: If the food or the drink is in his throat, or a state of sleep, his fast will not be overwhelmed, because the one who is considered to be constant and abstinence, and his deeds does not contradict that.The second footnote: Our saying about the breakfast is three: the entry of within, the external exit, and the intercourse, and the number of entry every eyes arrived from the back to the interior from the one who is from the one The brain or the stomach and the infection in the intestine and the octagonal, while the brain will get the fungus with the cap And the smoothness invalidates the fast, and the consensus is the penetration that invalidates the fast.The third restriction: He said with us with the knowledge of his being a fasting person, so if he ate or drinks the people of the fast, his fast will not be invalidated by Abu Hanifa, The lord of the lord: Our saying is one of the first people of the honest dawn, and the evidence is upon him the saying of the Exalted [Al -Baqarah: 187] and the word (even) because the end of the end, and the blind said: The first time is if the sun was pronounced, and he would swift the most and drink after the soles of the dawn, It is necessary that (P-78) ended the day from the sunset, so it is also necessary for it to be from its rituals, and this is the same The father of Hanifa entered upon him, and he said to him: “You are a trust at my heart and you are in your house, so how if you visit me!Abu Hanifa was silent about him, and when he came out of him, he was told: Why did he silence him?He said: And what do I say in a man who fasted and what was prayed in his eternity?It means that he was eating after the second dawn before the sun, so there was no fasting for him, and he was not lined with landing, so he did not pray for him.The Fifth Limited: Our saying to the sunset, and his evidence is his saying to him, peace be upon him: He says the time for breakfast at the sunset of the sun.The sixth restriction: our saying with the intention, and from the people who says: There is no need for the fasting of Ramadan to the intention, because God is up to God, and he said: The constipation, and it was found and it is removed from the task, because we say: It is necessary from the intention because The fasting is a work with the evidence of his saying, peace be upon him: “The best of the fast is fasting.” The sixth question: those who say that the advanced verse indicates that the valid resident is a choice between that he fasts and among the breakfast, they said: People with her and Abu Mimlam Al -Asfahni and the deaf denounced that, and the explanation of this question may be presented.Then, with the appreciation of the validity of the saying of this copy, this indicates that we copy the lighter with the heavy one is permissible, because the positive of the fast is on the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less than the one who is less Between it and between the ransom.As for the saying of the Exalted: Whoever is sick or on a travel is a number of days from the last days, then the interpretation of this verse may be presented, and it may be presented.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: God wants you to the secret and does not want the hardship on you, so know that this speech is good, it is good for us, and it is the condition of what is the condition like that; Because God Almighty has fulfilled fasting on the path of easy and ease, it is what he answered except in a few periods of the Sunnah, then that little is what he answered, and it is not obligatory That is a sponsor of the meaning of the ease and the ease, and we are: Because it is easy for the affairs and the captive hand, it was said that the verb is easy, and it was said that the matter is easy with the wish.The second question: the disgraceful of this verse is that it is not unbearable to be unbearable, and they said that it is up to what it is clear that he wants to do what he wants to do.How does they cost them what they do not know of faith, and his answer is that the secret and the hardship are not unaware of what is proven in the origins of the jurisprudence that the word is the one And the imam does not benefit the general, and also, so if we greeted us, but he might display to the preceding buds, so we will tell him to the precedent in this way.* * * The third question: the disgraceful, they are held in this verse in the evidence that it may happen from the servant what God does not want, and that is because the one who is satisfied is the one who is satisfied Until he stressed it, it was obligatory to have what God did not want from him as it was not (P-79) he wanted hardship.Answer: The memorizer begged that he is not a matter that he does not want to command him in the difficulty, and if he may want the hardship from him, and that is because we have the matter.The fourth question said: This is a sign of his mercy, his grace for his worshipers, and if he wanted them to disbelieve, then they will turn to the fire, and they will be to the fire The infidelity was not appropriate for him to say: God wants you to the secret and does not want the hardship to you, and the answer is that he is opposed to knowledge.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Let them complete the number, in it, in it: the first question: Abu Bakr read on the authority With lightness, and they are two languages: I have completed and filled.The second question: for a saying to say: And to complete the number on what was commented?Our answer: They gathered on the fact that the act is deleted.Perhaps you will be thankful, so do the sentence of what is mentioned, which is the matter of the number of enemies, and the knowledge of how the judiciary, and the privatization in the pornography of the innocence, and that is for you, and that is for you, and that is for you.The three things mentioned their heads of three, so he said it: Let them complete the number of the matter of the matter of taking into account the number of the enemy, and let them grow up.Perhaps you will thank you for the cause of the license and the sacrifice, and we will reiterate what we have mentioned from the deletion of the average verb that is before it.The heavens and the earth, and to be from the defeated [Al -Anam: 75], that is, we see it.The second direction: What the gum said, which is that what is meant by it is that the one who was presented to the evaluation to the resident is valid, and the summary of the sick and the traveler is that it is Because with the energy, it is necessary for him to entrust the enemy, and with the privilege in the disease and the
