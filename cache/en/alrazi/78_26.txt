The researcher, the Quran, is the one: His Excellency said: They do not taste in it a cold or a drink except for the dignity and the washing of the penalty and the agreement and in which there are books: the first question: if we choose the saying They taste a cold or a drink that is connected to what is before it, and the guarantee is in his saying: (in it) is based on the bags, and if we did not say about it, this was the words of it.He said it to Hell.The second question: in his saying: (cold) and Jahan: The first: that it is the well -known cold, and what is meant is that they do not taste with the intensity of the freedom that is in which there is a comfort It is forbidden from fire, and they do not find a drink that relieves its thirst, and removes the burning from their homes, and the one who gets that they do not find a cold air, and no cold water.The second: The cold is the sleep, and it is the saying of the fearful, the zaei, the virginity, the dirt, and the al -Atabi.So he is used to sleep, and Abu Ubaidah sang and the righteous in Bayan is that what is meant is the saying of the poet: المرية The paradise of it was repeated to me, so he will be a lifetime of me, and he will be a lifetime of me, so he will be a lifetime of me, so he will be a lifetime of me, so he will be a lifetime of me, so he will be.The sleep, the mighty said: Among the words of the Arabs: The cold is prevented from the cold, that is, I have been afflicted with the cold, what prevented me from the sleep, and I know that the first saying is that it is the first one, for the first one, for the sake of the first.The famous truth, there is no meaning for his pregnancy on the immersive, and those who say the second saying, they are touched in his proof of it with the authority of the first: It is said: I was tasted.The second: They taste the cold of the Zahir, so it is not true that they are said that they did not tasted a cold, and he endowed that that cold is a cold that they tasted with it, but it was, but it was.The answer is about the first: Just as the ritual of the cold is metaphor, so it is also the supity of the sleep, and it is also metaphor, and because what is meant is from its saying: they do not taste in it, that is, it is not a cold, that is, it is not a cold, that is, it is not a cold, that is, it is not a cold, that is, it is not a cold, that is, it is not.There is no cold air, and the inhaled air is the mouth of the mouth and the nose, so the release of the disclosure of it.The answer is about the second: that he did not say: they do not taste the cold, but he said: They do not taste one cold in it, which is the cold that they interact with it.The third is the one: they mentioned in the Hamm that it is the melted yellow, and it is void, but the generous water is very spicy water.The loyal question: they mentioned in the washing and its faces: one of them: Abu Muhah said: I was hearing our teeth, saying: The rusk is an Arab, an Arab They will be able to: (P-15) Khashak.And the second: that the washing is the cold thing that is unbearable, and it is called the missionary.And the third of it: the rushing is what the people of the fire and their hearts are from the friend, the sacrifice, the sweat, and the bridges of the dominant wetness, and in the book of the cell: the dusk of the eyes, Daggered and dusk.And its seed: the rusk is the ritual, and its evidence is what was narrated that it is upon him peace, he said: “If a sign of the rusk is burned on the world, you are the people of the world.” Fifthly: that the x -shackle is the dark, he said: And from the evil of a sursion if it is raised [Al -Falaq: 3], so the washing is a drink that is the most miserable, as it is a shame, as it will be wise.Dark.If you know this, then say: If the hemorrhage is pleased with the cold, the estimation is: they do not taste in it, except for a washing and no drink, except that they are the same And the same from the poetry is the saying of the qais: ؎ As if the hearts of the bird are moisturizing and dressed ∗∗∗ Li and its rhetoric and the core of the mind and the meaning as if the hearts of the good The bald mill.But if we are pleased with the rusk with the friend, or with the tender, it is to be carried that the discretion is with the dignity and the rusk, returning to the cold and the drink together, and that it will be in the past.As for the first indifference: it is that the estimation is: they do not taste in it a drink except the genius that is exaggerated in the generosity and the authentic friend.As for the second indifference: it is that the estimation is: they do not taste a drink except that the generous of the generous in the generosity or the friend of the affliction, and God knows best, for the sake of the righteousness Do you drink?We said: It is a luminous, so I can drink in the sentence.The fifth question: Reading Hamza and Al -Kisa’i and Asim from the narration of Hafs from him: (rushing) with tension, as if he is active in the sense of the meaning, and the meaning of the one, and the meaning of the one, Drink, and the first is a name, and the second is a name.And know that he was exalted when he explained the types of the disbelievers showing that after that it is: a reward, a agreement, in the sense, and to the first: the first: that it is up to them.They came with a severe disobedience, so the punishment (agreement) for the domain, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: a bad, bad, like [Al -Shura: 40].The second: that (agreement) from where he did not increase the destiny of the investigator and did not decrease from it, and the grammarians mentioned it in it, it is one of them: one of them: that it is the one who is the one who is in it.And the estimation is an agreed part.And the second: to be a stapler on the source and estimation as a reward and agreed with their work (in agreement).And the third of it: that it is described as the source as it is said: so that a virtue and generosity; To be completely in that sense, as well as here, when this is complete, he was complete in his universe on the sake of investigator and described the penalty with his being (and agreement).And the one that is: to be the deletion of the added and estimated part of the penalty.And Abu Hayyah read: “Fad” is effective from the horizon, so it was

the Sunnah if the disbelief is signed with the creation of God and its creation, so how is this?As for the dwarfs of the disgrace, the knowledge of God was the same as their faith, and their faith was
