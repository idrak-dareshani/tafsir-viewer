The Quranic researcher said, "Taafla, a group of your Lord, and they are asleep, and you became like the honest, a group of your Lord: that is, a torment from your Lord, and the sects are only a kind God, the dog said: God sent a fire from the sky, so they were divided while they were sleeping, and the paradise became like the wicked.And know that the wicked is an act, so it is necessary to be in the sense of the verb, and that it be in the sense of the subject, and we are the informants: one of them: that it was a burning, it was a distraction.The fruit, and if the difference gets the difference in other things, then the trees, if they are burned, are not like the trees that were cut off, except that this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has this.But the like in the fruit of the fruit is a score.And the second: Al -Hasan said: That is, the good is made for it, so there is nothing in it, and on these two guys, the wicked in the sense of the bachelors.And the third of it: the wasting of the sand is a huge cut that is drawn from the path of sand and the collection of the parties.The interruption is from the sand, and it does not grow up anything that is beneficial.And its lord: the morning is called a hook; Because he was drawn from the night, and the meaning is that that paradise wore and gave its greenness, and nothing remains in it, from their saying: the vessel is overwhelmed.Fifth: that when she was burned, she became like a dark night, and the night is named after the day, and the day is also called, as well.Because each one of them is depicted by the other, and on this precedence in the sense of strictness, and a people said: The night was called a honest, because it is a slander of it, and it is the same Acting in the sense of an actor, and others said: The night was called by the wicked; Because it makes the light of sight and cut it.* * * Then he said: â€œSo they called for the morning to be gone on your plow, if you were steadfast, a fighter said: When they became, some of them said to each other: The fruits, the pulp, and the tubes, and for that he said: they are strict; Because they wanted to cut the fruits from these trees.If it was said: Why did you not say, go to your plow, and what is the meaning of (Ali)?We said: When the glands were to him, they would have been hurt and cut it, it was a lunch on it, as you say: Tomorrow the enemy, and it is permissible to join the meantime, As they say: they are overwhelmed by the eyelid and comfortable, that is, then accept your plows.
