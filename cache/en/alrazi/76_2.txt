The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: We created the human being from a synthesis in which there are issues: the first question: the mixture in the language of mixing, it is said: a bush, the wigs of the wig, if it is mixed, and it is mixed, and it is mixed.The mixture, Ibn al -Arabi said: One of them is wig and irritation, and it is said to the woman if he mixes with irrigation; Like your words, a ritual, and a ruggedness, as you say.Al -Hudhali said: As if the feathers and the two sides are the disagreement of the source, the irritation of the argument was described by the arrow that he has diminished in the throw, so he said: “Scouts”: the shreds of a single memorial, and they are not collected; With an indication that it is a row for the individual, and it is his saying: a sperm or a wave and it is also said: a fragrance of irritation, and it is not valid to be a “mushroom” of the gathering of the one who is a gathering.The individuals, and its counterpart is a tine, that is: a broken cut, a moral and the land of the Sabbath, and they differed in the sense of the universe of the sever Singing the man's sperm with a woman's sperm; As his saying: It comes out from the crucifixion and the monument [Al -Tariq: 7] Ibn Abbas said: He is the mixing of the water of the man while he is a thick, and the water of the woman is yellowing, The child is created from them, as it was from a nerve, a bone, and a force, so whoever sheds the man, and what was of meat and blood, and from the water of the woman, Mujahid said: It is the colors of the nomadic, And the sperm of the woman is Safarra, and Abd Allah said: Its shocks are her veins, and Al -Hassan said: It means from a sperm that is encouraged with blood, which is the blood of the urbanization, and that is the water of the man The rope of your menstruation was ropes, so the sperm was mixed with blood, and Qutdah said: The shoes is that the water and blood mixed first, then he becomes a relationship, then he becomes a ritual, then he becomes a ritual On the authority of that body, from a row to a row, and from one case to condition.And a people said: God Almighty has made in the sperm a mixture of the good ones who are in the human being from the free and ritual, and the wetness, and the possibility, and the estimation: So the added and the words were deleted, some scholars said: The first is that what is meant is the one who is a man's sperm and a woman; Because God Almighty has described the sperm as a comb, and if it becomes a relationship, he will not remain in it and described it that it is a sperm, but this indication is not the same as the one who is the same Water, air and hot.(P-2110) * As for his saying, the Almighty is: We will be in his minds: The first question: We will take it with it, with it to be wrapped in it, and it is like the man’s saying: Your right, and I will come to you, that is, to give you, as well as his saying: We will take it away, that is, we will be overlooked, and we will say it: and do not say it: To multiply.The second question: “We are wrapped” in the position of the situation, that is: we created it.The question Third: In the verse, they say: One of them: that it is in progress and delay, and the meaning made it we hear with vision to be destroyed.And the second saying: that there is no need for this change, and the meaning: We created it from these workshops, not for the resurrection, but rather for the sake and the two.Then he mentioned that he gave him what he was correct with, which is hearing and sight, so he said: So we made him hearing visionary, and hearing and insight are two sons of understanding, and he said: On the authority of Ibrahim, peace be upon him: Why do you worship what he does not hear or see [Maryam: 42] and also he may be intended to hear the obedient, as he said, “Heard and obedience” It is said: So, so that there is no vision in this matter, and among them is those who said: Rather, it is intended with hearing and insightful, the two well -being.And God Almighty has the same remembrance because they are the greatest and honorable people.His Excellency said: We guided him the way, God Almighty told that he was raised and gave him the phenomenon and the interior, showing him the path of guidance, and the misfortune, The verse indicates that giving obsessions like the presenter to give the mind, and the matter is like that; Because the human being was created on the principle of the breakfast, free from the knowledge of things, but he gave him machines that he would seek on the acquisition of these knowledge, and they are obsessive, and the phenomenon is the one who is the phenomenon.With the senses, he alerted to the shares between them and the principles, from which the proud of the proud of the first, as our knowledge is that the negation and the evidence does not come to the one, and that it does not Part, and this is the first sciences of the mind; Because with its installations, it is possible to communicate to inform the theory, so it has proven that the sense is presented in the presence of the mind, and for that, then it is said: Knowing, and whoever said: What is meant is from his being, hearing a visionary is the mind - he said: What has been shown in the first verse is that he gave him the mind that he has given him that he is the reason To show him the path and show him that the one who must do what he is, and who is not permissible.The second question: The way is the one who is used from the way, so it is permissible for those who are intended to be the way, here is the way of goodness, evil, survivor, and halak, We recognized him and showed us the Kayfiyyah of each one of them, as the Almighty saying: We guided him to find it [the country: 10] and the path is a name for the sons, so for the sake of this Like the Almighty saying: The human being is in a loss [Al -Ashar: 2] and it is permissible for those who are intended to be the path of guidance; Because it is the well-known way that is entitled to this name on divorce, as for the path of misguidance, it is a way to add to the addition, not to see it: P-11) We prevailed and our greatness, so they made us the ways [Al -Ahdab: 67].He went to this, he made the meaning of his saying: We guided him, that is, we guided him, and if he was guided by the path of the truth, then we were alerted to avoiding others, so the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the same The face.The third question: What is meant by the guidance of the way is the creation of the evidence, the creation of the calm mind, and the mission of the prophets, and the books of the books, as if it is up to you, he said: He said: I gave you all that you need: to give you someone who has been in a clear one [Anfal: 42], and for us to create our guidance, do you not see that he mentioned the sake, so he said: that.The following question: Al -Farah said: We guided him to the way, and to the way, and for the way, all of that is permissible in the language.
