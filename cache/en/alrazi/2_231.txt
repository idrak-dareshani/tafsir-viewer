The Quranic researcher (P-93) said to be the Almighty: If you divorced women, then let them down, so they will hold them with a well-being, or they will leave them with a feat of no That is the injustice of its soul and do not take the verses of God, shake and remember the grace of God on you, and what was revealed to you from the book and the rule of God, and God bless you A knowledgeable thing that I know is that in the verse: the first question: the first thing that must be presented in this verse is that there is a saying that he says: There is no difference between this and this is between this Its saying: (The divorce is two times, so it is held with a well -being or a secret with goodness, so the return of this verse after the mention of that verse is a good thing One of the most is unique, and it is not permissible.Between the divorcees, it is not a hidden, but the cocker is the separation, so this question is fell from them; The return, and the companions of Al -Shafi’i, may God have mercy on them and those who carried that verse on the way of the return, for this question is that the question is that they say: A ruling on many pictures, and the proof of that judgment in some of those pictures is more important, and it was not far from that of that public judgment; This indicates that release is that there is a picture of the immediate With charity in which there is that it is necessary in the period of the number of these two things, and in this verse, it is in it that it is that it is the way of the enemy, not from the time These two things, and it is known that the sponsorship of one of these two things is when the enemies of the enemy are over.The types of abuse to divorce them, and then return it to two times at the last time until it remains in the number of nine months, so when this was the greatest of the types God restores the ruling of this image; His saying: So they held them with a well -known norm to the bull, and the scholars differed in the entirety of the boundaries, so the Shafi’i said, may God be pleased with him: In words, the return was only with words.The return with the slowdown was a return, otherwise no.The Hajj of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, what was narrated.And peace: They are hurt by the bulls in the time of menstruation, and it was not permissible to slow down in the time of menstruation, so it is necessary that the slow will not be a fee.And the Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, was that he said: So they grabbed them with a well -being, and he was a matter of immorality.Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, is that when he said: It is necessary to speak, so he showed his opinion that the martyrdom of the return is a disobedient, and he said, and it is not obligatory.May God be pleased with them, and he said in (Al-Amal): He is obligatory, and he is the choice of (P-94) Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabiri, and the argument is in it.Unless he knows it, and we are gathered on that it is not obligatory to know what is the witness, then the two witnesses should be a duty.The first answered that what is meant by the well -known is the observance and the delivery of goodness, not what you mentioned.* * * The third question: for a saying that he says: It is an adult that has been proven when the larger is the right to the right, and the larger is a phrase from the elimination of the enemy, and the enemy is not.It proves the right of the bull.And the answer is from two voices: one of them: what is meant by the wig is the purpose of the dawn, not the same thing The man, if the country is close to the country: we have reached us.The second: that the term is a name for obligation, so we carry it on the time that is the last time that can be rhythm in the return to it, in terms of if you missed, then it will not be done after it, and this is not the same.There is no need for us to metaphor.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Do not hold them in a light, so they have two issues: the first question: for a saying to say: There is no difference between him to say: So, then: His saying: And do not hold them light, because the matter is forbidden against it against it, so what is good in the renovation?The answer: The matter is only beneficial for one time, so all the hamats do not take over, but the forbidden is that all the hamats are in charge of it, so perhaps he will hold it in the case of it, and it is in the case of it The future time, and when the Almighty said: Do not hold them, the young people were paid, the youths were pushed, and the rituals were wandered.The second question: Al -Qafaf said: The harm is the hardened, the Almighty said: Those who took a mosque in a light [repentance: 107], meaning they took the mosque to the one who is unborn Its meaning was due to the excitement of hostility, the removal of the thousand, the rhythm of the wing, and the duties of the alienation.And the interpreters mentioned the interpretation of this harm and faces: one of them: what was narrated that the man was calling the woman and then calling her, so if he sought the sake of the reader, then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who called the one who is the one who called it the third, then the one who called the one who is the one who called it, It does it until it remains in the number of nine or more.The second is in the interpretation of the damage: bad ten.The third: the upcoming of the height, and know that they were doing in the ignorance, the most of these works, please that the woman will be dispensed with it.As for his words, the Almighty: To be used to his mouth and Jahan: The first: What is meant do not harm them, so you will be accustomed.The Farisin to be an enemy and sorrow for them [Al -Qasas: 8], that is, it was for them, and it is the mother of the punishment.The second: that the meaning is: Do not harms them on the intention of the one who is in the way of them, then you will become a blindfold for God, and you will be baptized for those who are intended, and they are not intense He doubted that this is the greatest species of ticks.As for the saying of the Exalted: And whoever does that, he has unjust himself, so he will be in his faces: one of them: he wronged himself by being overwhelmed by the torment of God.And secondly: He did not have himself that you have fulfilled the benefits of the world and the religion, but the benefits of the world, then if it is famous for what is between the people, there is no way It is not one of the benefits of religion, as the reward for the ten days with the people with the people and the reward that has been made to the rulings of God, the Almighty.As for the saying of the Exalted: Do not take the verses of God a shake in his faces: The first: that whoever forgets it, then he did not do it after we set it (p-95).The matter, it is said in it: He is mocked by this matter and played with it, so that everyone who commands that he is obliged to obey God and obey His Messenger, and his Messenger, Its remembrance is presented in the number, the return, the immortality, and the leaving the hardened, so it does not disrupt its performance, it was like a mockery of it, and this is a great guidance.And the second: What is meant: and do not forgive in the clogging of God, as it is forgiven, as it is in the matter of humor and mission.And the third: “Abu al -Daradaa said: The man was divorced in the ignorance, and he says: I divorced while I was a player, and he is kept up and marries, and he says like that, so God is the same The Messenger of God read it ﷺ, and he said: “Whoever divorced, liberated or walked, then he claimed that he is a player, then he is a grandfather.” And the lord: Ata said: The meaning is that the person seeking forgiveness from the sin if it was Egypt or on his example, it was like a mockery of the verses of God, and the Lord is the first Because his saying: Do not take the verses of God, be guided, and threw up if it is reminded of the remembrance of the destruction, that was the threat of threats to leave it, There is nothing else, and know that it is exalted when he wanted them to perform the cost of what was mentioned of the supplies, he also wanted them to perform it that he mentioned it, so they mentioned it First of all its remembrance on the path of the bolds, and he said: And remember the grace of God on you, and this is the blessings of God on the servant in the world and in the religion, then the religion is, then the religion is, then the religion is, then The blessings of the religion, but rather it was mentioned by the remembrance because it is better than the blessings of the world, so he said: And what was revealed to you from the book and the ruling that will exalt you with it, and the meaning is that it is the book, and the meaning is that Then he said: Fear God, that is, in all his orders, and do not disagree with Him in His Worships and know that God has everything knowledgeable.
