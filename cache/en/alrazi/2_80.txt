The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: And they said that the fire will not touch us except for the numbers of days.This is the third type of the domes of their sayings and their acts, and it is the reward for them that God Almighty does not torture them except for a few days, and this is the reward for me Our saying, because God does what he does and governs what he wants, there is no symptoms for anyone in his act, so there is no way to know that only with the same Because the mind indicates that the sins are entitled to God's permanent punishment.His demise after her to a listening to show that, and she proves that on the two days, there is no way to know that only by the hearing, and where there is no The reward is with that, and here are two issues: the first question: they mentioned the interpretation of the numbers of days and two sides: the first: that the days of the days are not added to the tenth Added to what is above it.It is said: Five days and ten days, and there are no ten days, except that this shall be formed by the Almighty saying: The fast is written on you as you have written to you who have been written for you You fear many days [Al -Baqarah: 183] are the days of the whole month, and they are more than ten.Then the judge said: If it is proven that the days are of the ten days, then it is without it, then the like is to say: It is the least or the most, because whoever says three say: A face, and whoever says: ten, he says: I carry it over the most and has a face, but he carried it on the middle, means what is less than the twenty and the one who has the same There is no one in the number of God, unless it comes in its estimation, a correct narration, then it is necessary to say it, and a group of those who are able to say, The Jews used to say: The world is seven thousand years.And the deaf narrated from some of the people that they worshiped the wheel seven days, and they were saying: God is a rally that tormented us seven days, and these two vagins are weak.As for the first: because it is not between the inhabitants of the world seven thousand years and between the time of the torment seventy days of time and the bound of the bit.As for the second: Because it is not necessary from the category of disobedience, estimated at seven days, to be their torment as well.As for our saying, it is good for God to do everything in the ruling of the money There is no repentance or pardon, then it was said: Is it not a reason that prevented the savage of the Ziyah, and he said: A bad is bad, like that [Al -Shura: 40] On disobedience?We said: The disobedience is increasing with the amount of grace, so when the blessings of God on worshipers were out of life and the limit, there was no crime.The second face: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he was pleased with these days with the forty, and it is the number of days that they worshiped the calf in it, and the words are upon him.The third face: It was said in the sense of “numbers” a few, such as his saying: And he shared it with a thickness with a minimum of the numbers of it [Joseph: 20] Hanafi went until the least period of time is three days and the most tenth of it, and they were brought up with it by saying it ﷺ: A number that is called three days and most of it is ten days, so it is necessary to be the least of the menstrual three and more than ten, and the forms of it.The third: He mentioned here: And they said that the fire will not touch us except for numbers and in the family of Amran: except for many days, and he said: Why were the first people?And the description in the two places is one of the two days, and it is "days"?And if it is feminine, the origin is in the adjective of the whole of the thousand, and it is said: Jaris, cries, broken, disappointed, and my answers.A remembrance in some of the pictures is rarely, the grace of Hammam, Hammamah, and a sentence of causes, calamities, and on this, and the response of the Almighty said: On the days of the number of the rituals: [203] God is up to the cow of the cow, which is the origin, and it is the one who said: May God grant his covenant, and he has the names: (P-131) The first question: The covenant is in this position that runs the course of the promise and the news.Glory be to him from the dignitaries of us with the division and the vow.Related to a deletion and his appreciation, if you take a covenant of God, and God will not succeed his covenant.It is a denial because it is not permissible to make the argument of his Messenger in their saying that he will understand them, but what is meant is that it is a way to the way of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the way to knowledge This estimation is only by hearing, so when there was no hearing evidence, it is not permissible to be rewarded with this estimation.The following question: His Excellency said: God will not succeed his covenant, indicating that he is their pursuit and the exaltation of his liar and his enemy.Our companions said: Because the lies are a liquid, a deficiency, and the deficiency of God is referred, and the dismissed said: Because they are a scholar of the ugly of the ugly and a scholar, and the knowledge of the world, ugly; Because he is a lie and the scientist with the ugliness of the cubic and his crying is rich from him, he is alienated to do it, so he indicated that the lie from him is referred to him, so he said: If it was said: The covenant is the promise and the specialization of the thing with the remembrance indicates the negation of what it promised, so when the promise is specially, he does not succeed in the knowledge of the The mind is applied to that, because the successor in the promise is a peer and in the end of the day.Say: The remote significance is based on all kinds of lies.The fifth question: Al -Jubai said: The verse indicated that it was not the same and the promise of Moses or the wicked of the prophet after it is that it is up to come out of the people The denying, because it is if he promised them with that, it is not permissible to deny the Jews of this saying, and if it is proven that it is the highest that indicated that it is for that and it is that it is upon you and the exaltation of it, and it is upon you and the exaltation of it.They are forced from sins, so their torment must be permanently on what is the saying of Al -Waadiya, and if this is proven in the path of the nations, then it must be proven in this mother.It is not permissible to be different in the nations, as he was the destiny of disobedience from all of the whole, and he knows that this direction is in the end of the arbitrariness, so we do not say: Moses promised that he broke the people of Al -Kabir from the fire.His saying: If he promised them with that, he would not be denied by Jews.Male?Then we show a law that this is not necessary from the faces: one of them: Perhaps God Almighty, but he denied them because they said the days A number of days indicating a few days, so God Almighty denounced their reward for this few, not that he is the one who denounced them.And the second: that the recruiter is cut off in the sentence with pardon, but in the right of the appointed person, it is not a way to the piece, so when they judged the right The way of the reward is not a crime that God denied them.And the third of it: that they were disbelievers and with us the torment of the infidel is not to be interrupted, we greeted us that he was the highest and the peace be upon him, that he is the one who brings the people It comes out of them from Fire?He built him that it is a separation between it to be said: It is the highest of what he promised to leave them from the fire and between it to be said: He tells him that he does not bring them out of the fire and the first is not harmful to him (P-132) This was not said to Moses, except that he will do it on the day of resurrection, but rather he responded to Jews and that is because they were rewarded for it, so they would not have been.In it, and that they are not cut off, neither by the negation nor by the evidence, we greeted us that it is an exalted that does not come out of the stick of the people of Moses from the fire, and when you said: He does not leave the mother of this Al -Jaba’i said: Because his ruling is up to the promise and the bounty, it is not permissible to be different in the nations.It is a pure judgment, for the punishment is the right of God, so it may be preferred by some of the projection and that it is not preferable to that of the rest of that weak.As for his words, the Almighty: Or do you say to God what you do not know, then it is a biar for the completion of the mentioned pilgrimage, then if it is not a way to the estimation of the one who is the one There was no hearing, the reward for that fate was a saying to God Almighty with what is not known, not a referral, and this verse is indicated by the one who is: They have the saying that they said, there is no indication of our knowledge that the saying without a false evidence.And the second: that everything that is permissible and its existence is a mind that is not permissible for the destiny or to the negation except with a listener.And the third: that the denial of the measurement and the news of the one who holds this verse.They said: Because the measurement and the informing of the one does not benefit the knowledge, then it is not necessary that the one who holds it is permissible for it to say it: or do you say to God, do not know what you do not know.Denial.The answer is that when the significance indicated the path of work at the time of the suspicion that is drawn up to the measurement or to the news of the one who was the duty of the work, it is known, so the saying of it, then the saying of it, then the saying of the saying With information, not the knowledge.
