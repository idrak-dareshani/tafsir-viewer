The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: The people who disbelieved themselves are upon them, or if you did not warn them, they do not believe.We come to her if God Almighty wills, but his saying: (that) he has the books: (The first question): Know that (that) is a letter, and the letters do not have the right to do so in the work, for this The verb is a picture and a meaning, and that similar requires a worker, and it has a submission: (the first presenter): in the similar Bayan, and I know that this is the one who has the same.The meaning is, but in the memorization, it was composed of three rides, the last of which opened, and the names were required as the acts, and it enters it as the nickname, as if it is like me On the verb, we are: Gentle and come to me, and the meaning is because it benefits the meaning of the meaning in the name, and it is confirmed by his mystics with the news, as if you say, if you say: And he said: He stated that he had a meaning in the name.(The second presenter): It is when the actions likened to it, and it is similar to it in the work, and that is a phenomenon that is based on the rituals.(The third offered): What did the name erected and raised the news?And it is reported to be said: It is when it became a factor, so that you raise the beginning and the news with it, or install them together, or raise the beginning and the news, Because the beginning and the news were before the entry of (that) on them are two ways, and if they remained, then then they entered it, when he appeared to him, and he did not appear to him The work of the verb, the verb does not raise the two names, there is no meaning for your destruction, and the branch is not stronger than the original, and the second section is also false; Because this is also contrary to the work of the verb, because the verb does not install anything with its uncle of what it raises.The third section is also false; Because it leads to leveling between the origin and the branch, the action will be his work in the actors first by raising and then in the act of the picker, so if there is a sake, so let us go, so do not The settlement was brought between the origin and the branch.And when the three sections were appointed, the loud division is appointed: that it sets the name and raised (P-34) the news, and this is what is alerted that this is not in the ware In original, because the tendency to be presented to the mark is in the chapter of the verb is up to the original, so this is indicated by this that the work of this is the ware of this Rather, with an exhibiting way.* * * (The second question): Al -Basroun said: This letter is settled by the name and raised the news, and the Kufi said: It does not affect him in raising the news, but it is a lifetime, but it is a lifetime, but it is a lifetime, but it is a lifetime.Before that.The pilgrimage of the Basrin: that this forefathers liken the verb completely similar to what he presented with his two, and the verb has an effect in raising, and the share, This forever must be like that.And the argument of the Kufi from two sides: The first: that the meaning of the expertise remains in the news of the beginning, and it is the first to fulfill the raising, so the expert will be raised, and if it is a righteous, and if it is a righteousness, and if it is a righteousness, and if it is a righteous, and if it is a righteousness, and if it is a righteous, and if it is a righteous, and if it is a righteous, and if it is a ritual His reaction to this forefathers, for this is the subconscious of three: one of them: our saying: the expert Beginning, and after entering the letters, “that“ the chain of transmission remains.And the second: Our saying: The expertise is that it is required for the failure: that is because the expertise was before entering.Part of the requirement; Because the numbers are not valid for the part of the cause, after entering this vice, the expertise was required to raise, because the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not.It affects that of faith, and it is the disagreement of origin.And the third of it: our saying: the expert is the first to be fulfilled, and its two bodies from two faces: the first: that his being is an expert and a true description of it, and that is the same.It is a matter of it, so it is not possible for him; Because the name makes them.The second: that the news is similar to the verb, a true similarity.Meaning, because it is not a chain of transmission, so the news of the news was stronger than the similarity of this letters of the verb, then if it is proven, then it is the time.For the sake of the act of verb, the first of the letters is due to its similarity to the verb.And the one who is very strong: when the expertise was stronger in the exaltation of raising, it is impossible to be this letters, because the expertise is on the basis of this letters, and if it is like that, if it is like that With the expertise before this letter, then this letter was found, if this judgment was bonded to it, then it was the same, and it is impossible.The second face: that his Sibuyeh agreed on that the letter is not originally in the work, so his support is on the convergence of the evidence, and what is proven in the dispute of the evidence.And the harm is implemented with its tones in the name, so it is obligatory not to do it in the news.* * * (The third question): Al -Anbari narrated that the cultivated Kindi rode to the cold, and he said: I find in the words of the Arabs to be stuffed, I find the Arabs: She says: The servant of God is standing, then you say: The servant of God is a standing, and the mighty said: Rather, the suffering is different to the conflict His resurrection, and their saying: The servant of God is an answer to a question of liquid, and their saying: The servant of God is for a standing answer to the denial of his resurrection, and the slave of the slave of God His saying that it is a remembrance of the question that he said: We have seen them, the sentences were obligatory from the beginning and the news if it is a answer to the division of the division: It is divorced, and it is indicated by the download: and they ask you about the two centuries.Al -Surah: We are short of your news with the truth that they are a girl who believes in their Lord [Al -Kahf: 13] and his saying: If you are your disobedience, then say: 216] And he said: Say: I have forbidden to worship those who call from God [Al-Anam: 56] and his saying: Say: I am the vow showing the one who is clear [Hajj: 89] (P-35) (P-35) From what he knows is that he is referring to the matter of the Prophet ﷺ that the infidels are answered in some of what they have fallen and they looked at him, and he said to him: So they came to me.The two worlds [the poets: 16] and his saying: Moses, Yafarin, said that I am a messenger from the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Araf: 104] and in the story of magic It is an answer to Pharaoh on his saying: He said that you believed before him that he was ears [Taha: 71] and Abd al -Qahar said: And the investigator is that it is for the sake of the tip of the In his disagreement, there is not there to “if”, but he is needed if the Samaid thought the dispute, and that you see it, it will increase the good if the news is a matter Wasa: Do you do the same people from the people, if you sing your soul in Elias, but it is good for its fall; Because most people do not carry themselves on the same.As for making it with the mother, a answer to the denial in your saying: “It is a more existing” good; Because if the words are with the denial, the need was to confirm more severe, and it is necessary that the denials be from the smile, it also carries that it be among the present.And know that it may come if the speaker thinks that he found that there is no such saying: He was from me with goodness, so he treated me with worsen You thought, and the mistake shows in the one who was delusional, and his saying is a story about the mother of Maryam: I said, Lord, that I put it on the authority of God.Likewise, the saying of Noah, peace be upon him, said: My Lord said that my people lied [Al -Shua’ar: 117].* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Those who disbelieved in their books: (the first question): Know that he is difficult for the speakers of the remembrance of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Everything that is transmitted from Muhammad ﷺ is that he went to him and said to him, so it is that the validity of that transmission is known to be a few or by the one.As for the first section: It is the one who was known as the coming of the Messenger, peace be upon him, who believes him in All of that is a believer, and whoever does not believe him in that, but that he does not believe him in all of her, or that he does not believe him in some without some, then he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the disbelief The messenger is true in something of what is known as the one who comes with him, and his example is who denied the existence of the chants, or as a scholar, or a fierce, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one, or the one who denies it, It is a balance from the disclosure and pests, or denied the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ, or the validity of the Holy Qur’an, or the purpose of which is the one who knew us from the good Muhammad ﷺ like the prayer of prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimage, and forbidding of usury and wine, so this is an infidel; Because he left the belief of the Messenger, as he knows that he is from his religion.As for the one who was known for the evidence that it is from his religion, the same as his being, knowledgeable or for his own knowledge, and that he is a visionary or otherwise, and that he is a man, and that he is a cousin, It is transmitted with the heroic frequency of the excuse of his coming, peace be upon him.It was not his denial nor the arrest of it within what is faith, so it is not obligatory for disbelief, and the evidence for it is that if this was a part of what the faith is a place The Messenger ﷺ is not to judge one of the faiths of one but after knowing that he knows the right to that issue, and if the matter was like that, he would not have been known in that The whole of the nation, and let us transfer the path of frequency, when it was not transferred to that, it is upon him that peace be upon him, what faith has stopped on it, and if it is like that, then it is not that it is not.Faith, and its denial is due to disbelief, and for the sake of this base, no one is atoned by this nation, and we do not atone for the pupils.(P-36) As for the one who is not a way to the narrators of the ones, it shows that it is not possible to stop the disbelief and faith on it.This is our saying in the truth of the infidelity, for it was said: What you mentioned on the opposite side is the same as the porn of the picnic and the tension of the gossip and its proverbs, for it is that it is the same Leave the belief of the Messenger ﷺ when he is aware of the harm that comes to him, we said: These are the things in the truth, not a disbelief, because the belief is not.The creation is upon him, and it is usual that the rule is not based Dahir, and make that apparent perseverance as a path for the law of the law, and the gossip and the tension of the gossip are from this section, for the phenomenon is that whoever believes the Messenger of the Messenger is not upon him He brings this action, so that he brought it to the large number It is a disbelief, for this is the summary of this section, and God knows.* * * Alertly to that al -Akhbar, if you know this, then we say: the dismissed of all that God has told about something past is like his saying: that the one who says: We have removed the remembrance and we have a preservation [Al -Hijar: 9], we descended it on the night of destiny [Al -Qadr: 1], we sent Noah [Noah: 1] that the words of God were the words of God.These are the forefathers and voices, or if it was something else.They said: Because the news of this direction is not sincere unless it is preceded by the news of it, and the valley is evident that it will be preceded by it.Approximately, it must be modern, he answered those who say that the words of the words about it from two voices: the first: that God Almighty was in the eternal world that the world will find that the world will find it That he will be found in the future, knowing that he had spoken in the past and did not have the need for the knowledge of God Almighty, so why is it not permissible to say that it was said that it is the one who has told the one who has been told.They will disbelieve, and when their disbelief was found, that news became a news about that they had disbelieved, and there was no necessity to tell God Almighty.The second: that God Almighty said: Let the mosque enter the forbidden [Al -Fateh: 27] So when they entered the mosque, it is imperative that it be transferred to that news that they have entered the gossip that they have entered That the first news changes, so if it is permissible, then it is not permissible in our question like it?Al -Muhsal answered first about the first question, and he said: When Abi Al -Husayn Al -Basri and his companions of knowledge, he changed when you change the knowledge, and how are the knowledge, and how are the knowledge, and how are the knowledge, and how are the knowledge, and how are the knowledge of the And that it will be found if the rest of the world is present, then that was ignorant, not knowledge, and if it is like that, that science must be changed, and on this, this is the case.And on the authority of the second: that God's informing and his words are special, and he said: “Let the mosque enter the forbidden, meaning that God is up to God.At the entry of the mosque, not that he spoke to him after the income of the mosque, then his theorist is in our question to be said: If his saying is: After the breasts of the disbelief from them, not before it, except that when it was said that it was a confession that you spoke it with that, and it was not in the eternal, and this is the one who is the one who is the one If we say that science changes the change of the knowledgeable, we are either we say that the world will be found in the eternal or what it was, if it was not in the eternal, then it was not in the eternal.Passing the ignorant.And that is a disbelief, and if we said that he was a scourge, then his shame requires the demise of the valley, and that bridged the chapter on the virtue of the scholarship of the world, and God knows.* * * (The third question): His saying: Those who disbelieved a form for a group with the imam of the endowment, and it is for the darkening of its backs, then (P-37) What is meant by this phenomenon; Because a lot of infidels became Muslim, we knew that God Almighty may speak to the year and be his own goal; Either for the sake of that the Qur’an indicating that what is meant is that of that of those in particular, it was an apparent in the time of the Messenger ﷺ, so the goodness of this is the same And his example is whether a person in the country has a gathering special from the rituals, then if he says: “People are hurting me”, then every one is that he wants it from the people of that gathering It is for the sake of speaking in the year for the special will is permissible, and if the Bayan is not based on it at the one who is permissible, the delay of the disclosure of the disclosure of the dedication, and if it is clear.It is not possible to hold anything from the form of the general in the piece of the severity of seeking to take advantage that the intention of it is the private, and the consort is indicative of that There is no good crime, and the best in the door is to say: If this is found, we would have known it, and where we did not know it, it is that it was not the same.Because the extent of the vastness of the afflictions is on the basis of the extent of the weakening of the beneficial emirates of thinking, as well Al -Waed on the piece on the back at the end of the weak, and God knows.Among the disgraceful of the one who has been defrauded to pay that, he said: His saying: “Those who disbelieve are not believed in“ like an illustration of his saying: “Those who disbelieve.” And he said: “Those who disbelieve believe in“ does not believe unless every one of them believes, then if it is proven that in the side of the confirmation, it is necessary to do so that the general must not be in.In general, it is sufficient in his sincerity that faith will not be released from one of them; Because when no one believes in that gathering, it was proven that that gathering did not come from faith, so I have proven that his saying: “Those who are unbelievers do not.” On his appearance, that no one of them believes, so how if many of them do not believe in?The answer: that his saying: Those who disbelieve the form of the collection, and his saying: They also do not believe in the form of a collection, and the collection, if it is gathered in the gathering, then it is the same Each of them is not believed, and then the reminders come back.* * * (The Fourth Performance): The people of the interpretation differed in what is meant by saying: Those who disbelieved and said: They are the presidents The stubborn people who have described them, may God bless the truth, and they know, and he is the saying of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, and he said: but the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is.كَأبِي لَهَبٍ وأبِي جَهْلٍ والوَلِيدِ بْنِ المُغِيرَةِ وأضْرابِهِمْ, وهُمُ الَّذِينَ جَحَدُوا بَعْدَ البَيِّنَةِ, وأنْكَرُوا بَعْدَ المَعْرِفَةِ, ونَظِيرُهُ ما قالَ اللَّهُ تَعالى: فَأعْرَضَ More to them, they do not hear and say our hearts in what you call us [and it was separated: 4, 5] and peace be upon him was free to believe in the people of God.Perhaps your soul is on their effects, if they do not believe in this hadith, sorry [Al -Kahf: 6] and he said: You will be disturbed by people until they are the one who is a believer: 99] Glory be to him, peace be upon him, that they do not believe in order to cut his greed from them and do not harm the reason for that, because the one is one of the two.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Whether to them, you will warn them, or did you not warn them, they do not believe in it in the books: (The first question): The owner of the scout said: He was described as describing the sources, from which he said: “Come to a word whether between us and between you [Al -Amran: 64] in the four days of the days of God: 10] In the sense of equal, as if it was said: Those who disbelieve are affiliated with them, your warning and numbers.(The second question): In the interest of whether they say: one of them: that his reaction to it is that it is a news because and you warned them or did you not warn them (p-38) in the place The effectiveness, as if it was said: Those who disbelieved themselves are your warning and numbers, as you say: Zone is a disgrace to his brother and his cousin.The second: To be, “to warn them or do not warn them” in the position of the appetite, and whether it is informed of it presented in the sense: whether they are your warning, and the word, and the one who has the same The second face is first; Because “both” is a name, and download it with the work of the verb, it is a leaving for the back of the backwardness, and it is not permissible.And the warning of the savage, so it should be “whether” news, so the news will be presented, and that indicates that you provide the news on the beginning, and it is not possible.Its exaltation said: Whether their lives and their deaths [Al -Jathiya: 21] and his Sibuh narrated their saying: And begged him from two voices: the first: the beginning is a self, and the news is a row, and the same before the adjective with the investigator, so it is necessary to be before it in the word, And the semester is the meaning.The second: The news must be offended, and if the news was presented on the beginning, the guerrilla was found before the remembrance, and it is not permissible; because The guarantor is the memorial that was referred to it to a knowledgeable matter, and the knowledge of it was accepted by it.You are required to be the beginning of the beginning, not to be obligatory, and from the second: that the guarantee is before the remembrance and signed in the words of the Arab The ruling.* * * (The third question: (They agreed on the fact that the verb is not told about it, because whoever said: He came out of a beating, and it was not coming with words, and from them, and from them, and from them.One of it: that his saying: I warned them or did you not warn them of a verb and have told him about his saying: Whether to them and his counterpart, he said: He will be imprisoned until [Yusuf: 35] and "he appeared" he "to be imprisoned." I tell him that he is a verb, for if it is said: the expert on it is a verb that is that word, and that word is a name, so we said: “So, the one who is the one who is the one who is: It is a verb, but rather this news was a lie, and the verification is that the experienced is that it is an action, either that it is a name or not, then if it was the first, then it was the first, then it was the first.The name is not a verb, and if it is a verb, the verb has become an informative about it, and the third: that if we say: the verb does not tell him about it, then he will not tell him about it And the one who told him about this news, even if it was a name that I had to tell us about the name that he is not informed of it, and this is a mistake, and if it is a verb, he said: These are: when you have been proven that there is no abuse in the act of the verb, we did not need to leave the phenomenon.The verb, then no estimation was: whether you are warning you and the number of your warning, for it was said: the enemy is from the truth to the metaphor, and it is necessary for you to be in the absence Al -Falaz, so what is the good is here?Because the people were informed of the righteousness, the custodians, and the symptoms of the verses and the indications of the states of the states, the ritual of the acceptance of the acceptance, and the one who said: Whether to them, your warning and your warning, when he stated that this meaning is that it was obtained in this time without what he accepted, and when he said: I warned them or did you not warn them (P-39) (P-39) Rather, it was obtained at this time, so that was the benefit of He got up and cut off from them, and we have indicated that the intended of this verse is that.* * * (The Rabi's question): The owner of the scout said: “the gossip” and “the mother” of two regenerators in the sense of the concern, and the meaning of them said: This was done on the letter of the question, as it was done on the letter of the call as his saying: Oh God, forgive us, O gang, meaning that this is done on the authority That was made on the image of the call and not a call.(Fifth question): In his saying: I warn them six readings: either with two achievements that are achieved between them a thousand, or there is no thousand between them, or the one between them, or the one between them, or between them, A strong and the second between them among them a thousand, or there is no thousand among them, and by deleting the letter of the questioner, and by his deletion and the righteousness of his kinship: “I have succeeded”, if it was said: What do you say in the second one to say the second?The owner of the scout said: It is a murmur outside the words of the Arabs.(The sixth question): The warning is the fear of the punishment of God with the impression of the tinkers, but the warning was mentioned without the evil; Because the effect of the action in the action and the blessing is stronger than the effect of the evil; Because the human being by paying the bush is more severe than his preoccupation with the right of the benefit, and this position is the position of the void, and the memory of the warning was first.* * * As for his saying: They do not believe in two issues: (The first question): The owner of the scout said: This is either that it is a sentence, or a seniority of the predecessor, “For”, and the sentence before it is symptoms.(The second question): The people of the Sunnah were broken with this verse and everything that is similar to it from its saying: the right of the saying is more than that: [7] He drew me and who I created and only to his saying: I will see him ascending [Al -Mudaqar: 11, 17] and his saying: I want a father to be a flame [Al -Assad: 1] Excellencies, telling a certain person that he does not believe in a cat.Al -Qabih is obligatory either ignorance or the need, and they are referred to God, and the one who is referred to the referred is referred to, so the release of faith from it is referred to, so the abandonment of it is the same In the form of science, it is that it is up to what he knew from it that it is not believed, so the breasts of faith from it were required of the mourning of the knowledge of God, the exaggeration of ignorance.The matter is located in the transfer.And we remember this on a third aspect: that the existence of faith is impossible to exist with the knowledge of the soul of faith; Because it is a knowledge, even if it was a custody of the knowledge that He gathered in faith, as it is in a manner and is a mourning with it, and it is referred, for the matter of faith is with the existence of the knowledge of God, the exalted of the faith of faith, with the gathering Between the numbers and the existence, and all of that is referred, and we remember this on the face of a luxurious: that it is the highest assignment of these who have informed them that they do not believe in the faith, and the faith is not believed In it, the truth of God is the Almighty in all that has been informed of it, and from what was told of it that they do not believe in a cat, they have become a cost of that they believe that they do not believe, and they will not believe in that With the collection between the negation and the evidence, and we remember this on a fifth aspect: that it is the Almighty to the disbelievers that they (P-40) tried to do anything on the authority His saying: They want to replace the words of God, say, you will not follow us, so that God said before [Al -Fateh: 15], so you have proven that the intention is that the intention is not to tell the Checking a intention to seek the words of God Almighty, and that is from him.Then, God Almighty told them that they do not believe in a girl, so the faith of faith from them will be a purpose to the way of the words of God, and that is what is from Him Also, contrary to the command of God Almighty, so the defamation will be made by the blessing and the verb, for this is the wives mentioned in this position, and this is the word The author and the successor were among those who were unable to pay the dignity of the dignity and the demolition of their barriers, and they have risen, and they were fired, and they were fired, They came with a persuasive thing, and I remember the maximum of what they mentioned with the help of God Almighty and his success: I said the dismissed: We have in this verse that is the one who is the one: The knowledge of God is the Almighty and the informing of God is the Almighty from faith, which is forbidden from faith, and the second place: the two mental answer to the way of detailing, but the first place: Wahwah: One of them: The Qur’an is full of the verses indicating that there is no prohibition for one of the faith, he said: And what people are forbidden to believe when the guidance came to them [94] The questioner, and it is known that a man if he loved another in a house where he could not be promoted, and then he says: What prevented you from the scoring?That was a pursuit of it, and also his saying: What are they upon them if they believed [Al -Araf: 12] and his saying to Episis: What is forbidden to prostrate [39] What prevented you, when you saw them, they went out [Taha: 92] and said it: What they do not believe in [Al -Nashaqaq: 20], so what they have about the memory are exposed to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one) They have [the repentance: 43], why do you prohibit what God has permitted for you [the prohibition: 1] The companion said Ibn Abbad in a chapter on him in this Chapter: How does he command him with faith and have prevented him from him?It is forbidden to infidelity and his pregnancy is upon him?And how does he tell him about faith and then say: Do you know?And they create the dismantling and then say: Do you think?And the disbelief was created in them and then said: Why do you disbelieve?And he created in them the confusion of the right to falsehood, then he says: Why did you wear the truth with falsehood [Al -Amran: 71] and reply them from the way, then he says: Why did he say: Amr: 99] And he took between them and between faith, then he said: What is upon them if they believed and went with them from the adults, then he said: So what do you go?] They were exposed and then said: So what they had to remember are offered.[The Population: 49].And the second: that God Almighty said: A messengers are miserable and warned, so that people will not be for God for God after the messenge They said, our Lord, if not you sent a messenger to us, then follow your verses before we are humiliated and disgraced [Taha: 134] So when he showed that he did not have an excuse for them, and he did not.With their disbelief, and his infidelity of their disbelief, what prevented them from faith, that was one of the greatest excuses and the strongest of the heaving face Mana.And the third of it: It was transcended from the infidels in the Surah “Ham al -Sajjah” that they said: Our hearts are in what you call us and in our ears and a cow, but the remembrance of God is for you.The saying, and if if the knowledge was forbidden, they would be honest in that, so did they not give them them?.And he pushed it: that he has revealed his saying: Those who disbelieve - to the end of it), deflected them, and diligently from the disbelievers and ugliness for their acts, so if they were, so if they did not They were able to do so, they would not be diligent, but they were excused, as the blind would be excused for not walking.Fifth: The Qur’an was revealed to be a pilgrimage to God and his Messenger on them, not that they have an argument for God and on his Messenger, so he was the knowledge They had to say: If you knew the infidels and told him that the disbelief was left, then the transfer of us would not ask us and did not command us to do?It is known that this is what is not an answer to God, nor for his Messenger, if it is proven that the knowledge and the news are forbidden.And its sixth: His exalted say: the blessing of the mourning and the blessing of the victory [Anfal: 40] and if it was with the ruling of the obstacles from the faith, he would have been charged with it, but it was not.And it is known that this is a disbelief, they said: It was proven by this face that it is not from faith and obedience, what is forbidden by a girl.Its numbers, it is not forbidden to faith.* * * The second place: they said: The one who indicates to The knowledge of the soul of faith is not prevented from the existence of faith and its faces: one of them: that if it was like that, it would not have been that God will be exalted beyond anything; Because the one who taught his fall is the obligation of the fall, and who knew the number of his falls, it will be the prohibition of the fall, and the duty is not able to it; Because if it was obligatory, not the fate, then the ability was obtained or if you did not get it, it was the duty The forbidden is not able to do it, so it is necessary that God will not be exalted be able to do anything in the first place Its existence.And the second: that science is related to the knowledgeable about what is on it, then if it is possible, its knowledge is possible, and if it is a duty of its knowledge, it is not obligatory, and it is not possible that the faith is to the soul.If he had become obligatory for the provision of knowledge, the knowledge was influenced by the knowledge, and we have indicated that it is referred.And the third of it: If the news and knowledge were forbidden, the servant would not be able to do anything in the first place; Because the one who taught God Almighty was the obligation of the fall, and the duty is not able to do it; And who knew his numbers was the righteous, and the forbidden is not able to do it, so it is obligatory that the servant would not be able The movements of camels, and the persecuting movements of the animals, but in the beginning, we know the corruption The wages, and we realize the beginnings of separation between whether the wages are brought to him, and between whether a person has a person with the choice, and for that, then the mind is in the mind.They realize the difference between the praise of the improvement and the vilification of the cause, and they seek and command, and they will be answered and say: Why did you do and did not leave?It was indicated that knowledge and telling are unlikely to be action and action.And he pushed it: If the knowledge was not forbidden to the existence of God, the command of God was exalted to disbelieve in faith as an order of his knowledge, and that he does not know that They are prepared, so they are not appropriate for him to command them to keep his knowledge; Because the execution of God and His attributes are not reasonable, and the matter of it is a fool and a mess, so it indicated that knowledge of the nomads is not a prohibition of existence.Fifthly: that faith in itself is from the one who is the possibilities that are granted, in view of itself and his eyes, so God must teach him from the possibilities of the possibilities.If he did not know it, so that the science was ignorant of it, and it is referred, and if God taught him, the Almighty is one of the possibilities that are not the one who does not seek the abundance of it, and it is not the same Knowledge is obligatory to gather on one thing, as it is from the places, And his universe is not from the possibilities, and that is referred.And its sixth: that the matter with the referral is his fool and a mess.On the hand of the liars, nor the landing of lies and falsehoods, and on this estimation, there is no savage of the authenticity of the prophethood of the prophets, nor with the authenticity of the Qur’an, but it is permissible.And shed it, and when we know that knowledge is the same as faith and the information about the faith of faith, it is not forbidden from faith.And the sake of it: that if it is permissible and the matter is the matter of the referral in this image of the reward (P-42) and the arrival of the command of the blind by the point of the Qur’an, and the consequence of the one who is in the authority of the He and his legs, and he was thrown from a shower of a mountain: Why do not you fly up?And when nothing is permissible in the minds, it is not permissible for the matter to be permissible, so it has proven that the knowledge of the number is not prevented from the presence.And eighth: If it is permissible and the matter is permissible for that, the mission of the prophets is permissible to the compacts, the books on it, and the angels are removed, and the angels will be removed, and that the end of it is the case, Success and manipulation of religion.And the ninth: that the knowledge of the existence of the thing if it is required and its answers would be the richest of knowledge about the ability and the will, so it is not necessary that God be the Almighty, and the Almighty is a murdered, and a murdered one, The philosophers said by the obligatory.And I adore it: the verses indicating that the unbearable is not exalted.78] And he said: They put them from them, and the analogy that was on them [Al -Arif: 157] and any embarrassment and hardship, according to the deposit of the transfer.* * * The third place: the answer is on the way of detail, for the one who is disgraced in it.The disagreement of the knowledge of God is the Almighty, so that his knowledge was ignorant of ignorance, they said a mistake, saying who says: He turns his knowledge ignorance, and he said: But he must hold on to the two sayings.The second: the way of the Kaabi and the choice of Abu al -Husayn al -Basri: that the knowledge is the knowledge of the knowledgeable, then if you are supposed to be from the servant from the faith, you know that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the same And when did you assume the occurrence of it, it is the disbelief, instead of faith, you know that the one who has the most knowledgeable is the knowledge of the disbelief, instead of faith, so this is the case of knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge, not the knowledge of the knowledge.These two answer are the ones that have used the fans of the disgraced.And I know that this search has become a result of great delusions: it is that the denying the crocodiles and the prophets said: We have heard the words of the people of algebra, so we found it.Citizen, and these two answers that were reminded of the disgraceful, the course of the khrafa, and the sane person does not fulfill them, and we heard the words of the disgrace that the saying is that it is not Advance and ugliness, and the answer that the people of al -Jabr mentioned are very weak, so the group of words became strong words in the denial of the integrity, and the absence With prophecies.And from that, those who appear in the Qur’an said: The one who is disgraced from the many verses indicated that there is no prohibition from faith and obedience, so they believed in it, and they said: The knowledge of the soul of faith is what is forbidden from it, so they believed in it, so it indicated that the Qur’an was returned against the mind and on its dispute He greeted from these, that this Qur’an is the Qur’an that Muhammad came to him ﷺ He asked him to the stabbing in it, and a people from the rejectionist said: This is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who came to us Muhammad came to him, but he was changed and replaced.The evidence for him to detect it on these contradictions that appeared in the causes of this debate view between the people of al -Jabr and the people of the destiny.And from that, the imitator who appears in the view and the reciprocate begged this view and said: If we were blessed with the consequences of the mind in the mind of the heart of the mind The prophecy is due to this view, because the words of the people of algebra in the end of power in the proof of algebra, and the words of the people of Qadr in Bayyan that when the domestication is made With the kidneys in the end of power, then he is born from the group of words, the greatest suspicion of praise, and the expression, and the prophecy, so it was proven that the return to the mind is to the mind.And misguidance, and when this was said: Whoever deepens in the words will be tied.And from that, Hesham ibn al-Hakam claimed that he was groaning, and not knowing that the elders are before (P-43) and its fall, and it was permissible to appear on God Almighty, and he said: If he said: You have to warn them, or did you not warn them, and they will not believe, but he fell on the path of the recipient of the practice, and it is permissible for him to appear, but he said: These are the advanced problems.And he knew that the sentence of the faces that we narrated from the dismissed words that are not related to the revelation of the answer.Rather, it is a running neighbor.فَأمّا الجَوابانِ اللَّذانِ عَلَيْهِما اعْتِمادُ القَوْمِ فَفي نِهايَةِ الضَّعْفِ.As for the saying of Abi Ali and Abi Hasham and the judge: He made a mistake of the saying of those who say that he is indicating, and he made a mistake of the saying of those who say that he does not indicate, if the one who wants to do is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the one Judgment of the corruption of negation and confirmation, and that is not the mind, and if it is with it that one of them is a right, but I do not know that the truth is that it is a man, or it does not turn.The direction of the recipient, for when we have shown that the knowledge of the number is only with the nomadic, and if the existence would have obtained it with it, then it would have gathered the none of the time A report that clarifies from this and the least presented in it.As for the saying of Al -Kaabi, in the end of the weak, because if we do not know that God Almighty was in the eternal world of the existence of faith or by his blood, we are the knowledge He was getting, and he is now present, and if he had obtained with one of the two critics that the other clarification, the meeting of the two contradictions was necessary, and if there is no one who said that there was no reason Acknowledgment of the flame of science ignorant, and this is the last of the words in this research.He knew that the meaningful words are the one who was presented, and he remained in this section of other things, persuasive, and it is necessary to mention it and it is five: one of them: narrated Al -Khatib in Khatib Bin Mu’az Al -Anbiri, he said: I was sitting at Amr ibn Ubayd, so a man brought him, and he said: O Abu Uthaman, I heard, and God is good, and he said: Did you hear?He said: I heard Hashem Al -Aqsa, saying: If you want a father to be a flame [Al -Assad: 1] and his saying: He domesticated me and whoever you created and only [Al -Muddar: 11] to his saying: [The Population: 26] This is not in the mother of the book and God is the Almighty saying: Ham and the book shown [smoke: 2] to his saying: And it is in the mother of the book to our religion for the authority of God: Except this, O Abu Uthaman, then Amr was silent, then he accepted me, so he said: And God, even if he was saying, as he said what he was on my father, from a lamb, from a mother, and no The man heard that he said: Do you say, O Abu Uthaman, that is, and God who said Mu'taz!He entered Islam and came out with disbelief.It was also narrated that he entered a man on Amr ibn Ubayd, and read it with him: Rather, it is a glorious Quran in a wiped out of the mihrab: (Take it) Was it in the fragmented wave?Amr said: It is not like this, but it was: I would like this one who did the same as what the father did for a flame, so the man said to him: So, he will be brought to us.And he said: The knowledge of God is not a partner, the knowledge of God does not harm or benefit.This is the story indicates the doubt of Amr ibn Ubaid in the validity of the Qur’an.And the second: The judge narrated in the book of the dismissed platforms of the “Ibn Umar”, that a man rose up with him, so he said: O Abu Abd al -Rahman, if the elders weighing and shedding And they kill the soul that forbade God except with the truth and say: That was in the knowledge of God, and we did not find from him, so he was angry, then he said: He said: They do it, so (P-44) did not bear the knowledge of God on its verb.Abi Umar ibn al -Khattab told me that he heard the Messenger of God ﷺ He says: The example of God's knowledge of you is like the same as the sky that you have, and the earth that is less The exit from the sky and the earth, so you do not seek exit from the knowledge of God Almighty, and as the sky and the earth do not bear you on the sins, so you will not be blessed..Know that in the news that Al -Gabriya and Al -Qadriya are narrated, and the extent of the narration of this hadith is that it is not appropriate for the Messenger to say that it is like that It is contradictory and corrupt.Pastern, because we have indicated that knowledge is the intensity of faith and the existence of faith is contradictory.And the land is that they do not contradict anything from the work, so it appeared that one of the two pictures is similar to the other.Hadiths are the most famous in this section: As for the first hadith: it is what was narrated in the two of the people on the authority of Al -Amash, on the authority of Zayd ibn Wahb, on the authority of Abdullah, the son of God, he said: The truthful is the friend: “One of you shall be combined in the stomach of his mother for four days as a sperm, and then it is a relationship like that, then you will be like that.Then God sends a king to him, and he will blow in it the soul, and he will be commanded by four words: He will write his livelihood, and his deeds, and his work, Other than him, if one of you does not do the work of the people of paradise until what is between him and between it except a arm, and he will be preceded by the book, and he will do it, so he will do it, and he will do it.To do the work of the people of the fire until it is between it and between it except a arm, and the book will be preceded on it, so he will work with the work of the people of paradise, so the garden is in the way of the paradise.Baghdad, on the authority of Amr ibn Ubayd, that he said: If I heard the blind, he would say this, then I would have lied to him, and if I heard Zidah ibn Wah, he would say this Abdullah bin Masoud says this is what I accepted.This is our covenant.Adam said: You who have chosen you for his messengers and his words, and revealed to you the teeth, so do you find God able to do it on me?He said: Yes, and the Messenger of God ﷺ said: The pilgrimage of Adam Moses.And the disgraceful, they stabbed in it from the faces: one of them: that this news requires that Moses be the defamation of Adam on the young, and that is the necessity of ignorance in the right of the sake of peace Featured.And the second: that the boy is how he is shut down and his father is with the thick saying.And the third of it: that he said: You are the one who was hard and brought them out of paradise, and Moses knew that the misery of creation and their delay from paradise was not from the one who was from the one who is one of it.And its elevation: that Adam - peace be upon him - was embarrassed with what was not a pilgrimage, if he was a pilgrimage, he would have been a paradise, and Haman, and the caller of the disbelievers, and that they would be blessed.The corruption of this argument.Fifth: that the Messenger, peace be upon him, was corrupted by Adam in that with us that he indicated that it is not right.If this is proven, the hadith must be carried on one of the three of the three.Peace was mentioned this story, except that when he entered what he heard except this words, he thought that peace be upon him, he mentioned it from the soul.And the second: He said: “Adam’s pilgrimage” is erected, meaning that Moses, peace be upon him, prevailed and made him a pilgrim, and that the one who brought him to Adam is not with an argument.And the third of it: It is the one who is not intended that it is not intended from the view of disobedience to disobedience, nor to apologize from him with the knowledge of God, but Moses - peace be upon him - he asked him - On that zalal, until it came out of paradise, and Adam said: If my abandonment is from paradise, it was not because of the time, but it is the same, but it is the same, but it is the reason.He was brought out from paradise to the earth and was a successor in it, and this meaning was written in the desertion, so there was no crime, the pilgrimage of Adam was a strong, and it became Moses, peace be upon him.He knew that the words in this question are very long, and the Qur’an is full of it, and we will decrease the saying in it in this interpretation if God is able to do so; And when we mentioned, we are enough.
