The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: and establish the prayer and pay zakat and what you are offered to yourself for the best that you find with God, God is what you do.Know that he was upset with pardon and forgiveness from the Jews, then he punished him with his words: and establish the prayer and pay zakat, and he will be on the authority of it, as it is for the sake of it.Pardon and forgiveness, as well as their obligation to notice themselves and its goodness to perform the obligatory prayer and zakat, and he warned them of what they promised.Then he said after him: And what you are presented to yourself is the best, and it appears that those who are intended for varying are from prayers and zakat, and he has explained that they find that they find it, and they will find it That business; Because it does not remain, and because the emotions of those things are not desired in it, so it remains that what is meant and the seizures of its reward and its reward, then he said: that God does not, He has a few and not many of the works, and it is a desire from where it is indicated that it is an adult that is rewarded for a few as it is rewarded for many, and warning of its disagreement is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good Goodness, and what leads to it, when what the woman brings from obedience is to lead to the great benefits, it must be described as that, and on this face, he said: You are successful [Hajj: 77].And they said that Paradise will not enter except for those who were a sofa or those who are Christians, who are their aspirations.Fear against them, and they are not saddened, know that this is the righteous type of recklessness of Jews and the semi -rituals in the hearts of the Muslims, and know that there is no one who says: Heaven is entered, nor Christians in the Jews, so it is necessary to detail the words, as if he said: (P-4) and the Juda said: He will not enter the paradise except for those who were the one who was a shame, and he said: Whoever is Christians, and does not correct in the words, with our knowledge, with our knowledge that every one of the two parties disbelieves the other, and his counterpart: and they said they are sodels or Christians: 135] As a person and suddenness, buttocks, and asphalting, if it was said: How was it said: He was a sophistication, on the neutrality of the name and the collection of the news?We said: The name was carried on the memory of “who” and the informing of its meaning, such as the rule of goodness: (Except who is the salon of hell), and Abi Bin Kaab read: His Excellency said: These are their aspirations, so what is meant is that that is their wishes, then they are the strictness Their aspirations and their saying: He will not enter Paradise with one security?We said: I refer to it to the muddy secretaries, and it is their wish that the believers will not be revealed to the believers.They want them as disbelievers, and their security is not to enter the paradise other than them, that is: that is the false secretariat of their aspirations, and the Almighty said: Say: Bring your proof of your proof: Paradise is only for those who were softest or Christians, and those who have their aspirations are symptoms, peace and blessings be upon him said: And he wished to God the secretariat.“And Ali, may God be pleased with him, said:“ Do not rely on the semen.* * * As for his words, he said: Say: Bring your proof, in it, in the first things: the first question: “Hat” is a voice with a house of E in the sense of preparation.The second question: The verse indicated that the claimant is whether it was called a negation or a proof, so it must have evidence and the proof, and that is from the truthfulness By imitation, the poet said: “Whoever claims something without a witness must be invalidated by his claim.They are paradise.The second: It is exalted when he denied that they had a proof that proves that those who converted to the face of God have a proof.The third: As if it was said to them: You are on what you are on, do not win the paradise, in my mind, if you changed your way and you have been given to you, and you are good for you You want to be in Islam, and a bay for the separation of their condition for the situation of those who enter paradise, so that they will take off from what they are, and they turn into this way, and they are the same His face to God is the Islam of the soul for the obedience of God, but the face was summed up by the remembrance of his faces: one of them: because it is the honor of the members from where it is the same The humiliation of the honorable was the first.And the second: that the face may be from the soul, God Almighty said: Everything is your heart except its face [Al -Qasas: 88] except to abide by the face of his Lord the highest [night: 20].And the third of it: that the greatest of worship is the prostration, and it is it to the face, so there is no crime in the face of the face with the remembrance, and this is why Zayd ibn Umar ibn al -Nafi said: For those who greeted him ∗∗∗ He has the earth to carry a weaving rock, and I became Muslim and faced with whom I have greeted ∗∗∗ He has the decay that carries a torture By humiliating it, and mentioned the face and wanted the same thing, and that is only with the purity, the subjugation, and the humiliation of the soul in his obedience, and its sins, and its sins, A sincere of God, it is not corrupted by a evil, (P-5) is not a worshiper with God other than him, or suspended his hope for others, and in that there is no significance that he does not He did it on the face of worship in salvation and kinship.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty: It is good, that is, it is necessary that it is its humor to God with good deeds, not with a heavy act, so the Indian is humiliated God has a rugged action, and the position of his saying: It is an improved, place These are his reward for his Lord, meaning the great reward, then with this sleeve, it is not caught by fear or sorrow, so there is no fear.As for the sorrow, it is from the fall and the past, as it may be from the future, so he warned the two of the two things at the end of the happiness; Because the great nakedness, if it lasted, is more and saves from fear and sorrow, then he does not grieve over something that misses it, nor on something that he gets, and he does not fear that he will be lost, and he will be lost.The end, and in that it is desirable in this way, and warning of its disagreement, which is the way of the infidels who are mentioned before, and know that it is the highest and the first, then the first His saying: How much of a king in the heavens [Al -Najm: 26] Then he said: Their neglect [Al -Najm: 26] and his saying: And among them is those who listen to you [Al -Anam: 25] and he said in another place: And he said: And among them is those who listen to you even if they come out of you [Muhammad: 16] and he did not say: He came out, and he knew that when we were pleased with him, he said: Whoever is the same, then he is the same Here is the truth of salvation, and that is only possible in the books: the first question: in the virtue of the intention, he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: He looks at your images or your business, but rather looks at your hearts and your signs.A food that I divided between the people, so God Almighty revealed to their Prophet.With it.The second question: if a person knows, thinks, or believes that he has a verb of verbs, a prevailing or payment of a warning in the heart of his heart, and he is a lip Surprisingly, the existence of that thing is on its numbers, and it is the will, for this will is the intention, and the source of it is for that intention of that knowledge or the opponent, if this is the knowledge of this So we say: The scholarship is either a single matter, or that it is two things, and on the second estimation, it is that it is every one of them, or it is not.One of them is resigned with that, or it is one of them, and it is transferred to that without the other, for this is four sections: the first: that the motive is one of the people, and it is one of the people, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the motive Seventh, when he saw it, he rose from his place, for this action is not a reason for him, except for his intention to do what is in the hurricane of the benefit, and what is in the leaving of the sacrifice from the war, so this is the name Work by salvation.The second: that He gathered the verb with a recession, as if he asked him the poor, the poor, and he will judge it; To be a custodian for him, and his universe, with the universe of every one of the two descriptions, where if he was unique, he would be independent of the elimination, and this is the end of this.The third: that no one of them is independent, if he was unique, but the group is independent, and this name is a sharing.The lord: that one of them will be transferred, and the other is a supporter, for example, for a person to be a person from obedience, so he agreed to attend the time when he performed a group of people.It is for him to hide because of their scenes, and this name is a mourning.(P-6) The third question: In the interpretation of his saying, peace be upon him: “The intention of the believer is better than his work.” And the obedience of the secret is better than the obedience of globalism, and this is not something; Because it is necessary that the intention of prayer be better than the same prayer.And the second: The intention is to last until the last work, the tanks do not sleep, and the sustainable is better than the interruption, and this is not something; Because he refers to the fact that many deeds are better than a few deeds, and also the art of prayer of prayer may only be obtained in a little moments, and the tears.And the third of it: that the intention of its inception is better than the work of its inception, and it is weak, as the work without intention is not the best in it, and the appearance of the prejudice is in the way.And the one that is: that what is meant is not to be proven to be the best, but what is meant is that the intention is better than the good deeds of his work, and it is weak; Because the carrying of the hadith on it is only beneficial to the clarification of the clarifications, but the good direction in the interpretation of it is said: the intention is not that all kinds of kinds of no Jazzam, and when it was given to all the flaws of the mortal, the verb must be arranged for it, even if it is not found, and if it is, it is proven that the intention is not to be exhausted, It is claimed that this intention is better than that work, and to build it from the faces: the first: that the intended one of all the works is to enlighten the heart with the knowledge of God The intention is the row of the heart, and the verb is not the row of the heart, and the effect of the row of the heart is stronger than the effect of the thief of the wounds in the heart, so there is no crime of the intention.And the second: that there is no meaning for the intention except the integrity to the rhythm of those work as an obedience to the worshipers and the perception of it, but rather the income of the works to preserve the remembrance of the remembrance, so the remembrance is removed.And the intention that is in the heart on the behalf to the work, such as the one who is intended for the lineage to the liquidation, and there is no doubt that the intended is honored by the liquefaction.And the third of it: The heart is honored by the body, so its action is honored than the action of the body, so the intention was better than the work.The loyal question: Know The work on three sections: obedience, ticks, and permissible.With the intentions, "the disobedience of disobedience is required to obey the intention, such as which feeds a poor money from other than it, or builds a mosque of forbidden money.The second: obedience, and it is connected to the intentions in the origin and in the guidance, but in the original, it is that the worship of God is attributed to it, so if the intending of the ravine becomes a disobedience, and it is a disobedience The intentions are many of those who are in the mosque and intended in it many verses: the first: the first: that he believes that he is the house Prayer and peace: And the second: that the prayer is expected after the prayer, so the state of waiting is like someone who is in the prayer.And the third of it: the absence of hearing, insight, and the bridges of the members of what is not empty, because the reward is enough, and it is in the sense of fasting, and it is the types of downs, and for that he said: “He said:” He said: “The Herbianism of my nation in the mosque.” And its seed: the heart and the secret of the kidneys to God Almighty.Fifth: Removing what is only God from the heart.And its sixth: to intend to benefit a knowledge or an order with a well -known or forbidden.And the sake of it: to benefit a brother in God, for that is the spoil of the people of religion.And eighth: that sins are left with life from God, so this is the way to multiply the intentions, and the priest of obedience is measured.The third division: the bridge of permissible, and nothing of them is only an intention or intentions, and he becomes from the merits of the relatives, so what is the greatest of the losing of those who lose it from it The news: “Whoever repents to God comes on the day of resurrection and his wind is good from the wind of the musk, and whoever repents for the other hand, the day of the resurrection comes from the rituals of the rituals.” I have how this is the intention, so know that the intention is to be destroyed if it is the pleasure of the minimum delights, or the purification of the proud of the many money, or (p-7) To supply it to the hearts of the women, then all of that makes the kindness disobedience, and if the intention is the residence of the Sunnah, and the payment of the narrators from the goodness of the servants of the servants of the Lord The mosque, then it is the eyes of the obedience, and if you know that, it is measured on him, the brief of permissible, and the bonding is that all that you did to the right of the truth, then the right to do the right, Its calculation is an account and its forbidden is torment.The fifth question: Know that if the ignorance hears the mind and the transfer that it is necessary for the intention, then he says in his soul when he is a tidal To be taught to God, and to leave for God, he thinks that this is a intention, and this is, so that The hadith of a soul, or a hadith for a tongue, and the intention is isolated from all of that, but the intention is the soul of the soul, and its inclination to what appeared to it is that it is in it.And the inclination, if he does not get, does not appreciate the human being, and it is like the saying of the youth: I intended to crave food, or like the empty: The acquisition of the inclination to the thing except by receiving its causes, and it is only the knowledge of the knowledge in it The migrants, if the desire of the marriage prevails, and does not imitate in the child, a valid supply, not urgent or later, he can not be signed by the intention of the child, but it is not possible Spending the desire, as the intention is the answer of the emitter, and there is no confusion except the desire, so how does the boy intends?It was proven that the intention is not a statement from the saying of the tongue or the heart, but rather a phrase for the fact that this is a moller, and that is a matter of a matter The leaks, and it may be excused in some of them.The sixth question: I know that the intentions of the people in obedience are divisions: Some of them are their work as an answer to the relief of fear, for he fears the fire, and whoever does not do the fire Desire in paradise, and the treatment for the sake of paradise is a factor for its stomach and its wing, as is the bad wages, and the cherry of the wickedness of the pulp, and the worship And thinking in it is a love for his journey, and the walking of the work is confirmed to him, and they are those who invite their Lord with the guilt and the east they want his face, and the reward of the people of the people, so the people of the people, so The approaches became known in the view of its generous face, and the attribution of the honor of the vulnerability with the mourning of paradise to the honor of the time in this place, as the place Carm.
