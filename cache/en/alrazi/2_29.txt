The researcher is the Almighty: He is the one who created for you what is in all the earth and then settled to the sky, so they settled seven heavens, and he is with everything that knows that this is the one who knows that this is the second You generalized the costs of their families, and the best of what God has sponsored and glorified, and this is the formation; For the integrity of the earth and the sky, but after the fact that life, then God mentioned the matter of life first and then follow it with the remembrance of the heavens, His interpretation has passed in his saying: worship your Lord who created you [Al -Baqarah: 21], and as for his saying: for you, it is indicated that the remembrance of the one said: For the sake of our integrity in religion and the world, but in the world, it will be reconciled and we will be strengthened by obedience, but in religion, it is for the sake of this, and it is the same.With his saying: (P-142), what is in the earth is all all the benefits, so it is what connects to the animal, the plants, the hostile, and the mountains, and from it what is connected to the harm of the wasting, the wasting, And the exalted indicated that all of that was created in order to take advantage of it, as he said: He was harnessed for you what is in the heavens and what is in the land [Al -Jathiya: 13], so as if he said: Mother, I will give you, and how do you atone for God, and you have created for you what is in the heavens and what is all in the earth, or it is said: How do you atone for the power of God, and the best of God, and the best of God Because he created for you what is in all the earth, how can he be excluded from your return, and then he is the highest of the consequences of these benefits in the waters of the water: 25] And he said in the first surah, the command of God and the Awn came to you for you [Al -Nahl: 5], to the last of it, and here are the questions: Because if he was like that, he was completed with that exaggeration, and the one who is completed with others is deficient in the same way, and that is upon God, a referral, for if he said: Upon to him, but to him, we said: that is the excess of that excess of that, is he the first of God to be up to the excess of that existence to Him or not?If it is the first, then it is the highest, then it has benefited from that action, then the warning will be removed, and if the second is not the second, that is not the same Excellency, it is not influenced by it.And the second: that whoever did a verb for an exhibition was incapable of obtaining that abuse except by the mediation of that action, and the reward for God is referred.And the third of it: It is up to the verb, if it was a verb, then that is the extent if it was a valid, then the action is necessary, and if it was an event, it was for the verdict of that Single is obligatory, and it is referred.And he pushed it: It is up to him, even if he would do for a sake of that.The supply is the patronage of the users of the costs, and if it would stand up to it, then it would have done what was spoiled in their right, but it is the right of it, but it is the same Know that he does not believe.Then they spoke to the blame in his words, the Almighty: He created for you what is in all the earth and in his saying: Except for worship [Al -Dharaiyat: 56] and they said: He is the one who does not do so, so he did not.It was for that thing for the sake of the wiseness, not a crime that God has released to Him, to memorize the supplies because of this similar.* * * weak; Because it is up to all, and it requires the interview of the individual with the individual, and the awareness is beneficial from a separate indication, and the jurisprudence of God, may God have mercy on them.Porn, and he has shown it in the origins of jurisprudence.The third question: it was said: It indicates the prohibition of the clay; Because it is the Almighty, he created for us what is in the land without the same earth, and it is a saying that he says in the terminology of the earth what is called that it is in the land, and it will be a whole, and there is no gathering The hostility is within that, and the veins of the earth and what runs a course of one for it, and because the thing is devoted to the remembrance that does not indicate the denial of the ruling.The following question: His saying: He created for you what is in all the earth, it requires that the need is not valid for God Almighty, except that he did not do this.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Then he went to the sky in it in it: The characteristics of the bodies, for God Almighty must be a balance from that, and because in the verse it is indicated by his corruption because his saying: (P-143), then the level of the one who is the one who was This is the high level of the place, and that was the first, and if it was first, he would not have been delayed from the creation of what is in the land.But his saying: Then it is a level that requires the relaxation, and when you have proven this, it must be interpreted, and its report is that the savage is the residence, it is said: the end of the oud is: To him, like the messenger arrow, if he intended it, a purpose is equal to it, as it is satisfied with something else, and from it, it is said: then it is equal to the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, And he did not make a time between them, and he did not mean anything after the enemy.The second question: His Excellency said: He is the one who created for you what is in all the earth and then settled to the sky, explaining it with his saying: Say: I will be satisfied Two days and make it a lot of this Lord The two worlds made it in it from its surnames, and it was blessed in it, and it was destined in its forces in four days throughout the two families [Chapter: 9, 10], in the sense of the destruction of the land in the land of the land in the Two other days, as the saying says: From the kufa to the city of ten days, and to the Mecca of Thirty on a day, he wants that all of that is this destiny, to the destiny, to the destiny, to the destiny, to the destiny of Others, and the group of six days on what he said: He created the heavens and the earth in six days [Al -A'raf: 54].* * * The third question: Some of the lengths said: This verse indicates that the creation of the earth before the creation of the sky, and so is the saying of it: I am not.The earth is on two days [Chapter: 9] to the words of the Almighty: Then he settled to the sky, and he said in the surah of the disputes: You are more created by the mother of the heavens, and he raised her heat, and he raised her and raised her.It was sacrificed and the land after that was made [the disputes: 27: 30], and this requires that the creation of the earth be the same after the heavens, and the scholars mentioned the answer to it: The earth was created before the heaven created it, but it was not the same until the heaven created; Because the praise is the mediator, and a saying that he says: This is a problematic matter from two faces: the first: that the earth is a great body, so he prevented the dislocation of it.Dragon is delayed from the creation of the sky, which was also created, not a delay in the creation of the sky.The second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: He created for you what is in all the earth, then it was equal to the sky that indicates that the creation of the earth was created and all that is in it is presented to the creation of the heavens.The earth can only be stated, then this verse requires that it be presented as a praise before the heaven creation and then the time is achieved.The answer: that his saying is up to the Almighty: and the land after that is required, it is required that the heaven create the heaven on the ground, and it is not necessary that it be the level of the heavens.And on this estimation, the contradiction will be removed, and a saying that he says: His exalted say: You are more creative as the mother of the sky, with her lifting of her thickness, so that he will make it.Its level is presented to the praise of the earth, but the earth will be given a mandate for the creation of the same earth, for the same sky and its level is presented to the same The question comes back.And the third of it: It is the correct answer that his saying: “Then” is not for the path of here, but it is on the side The great blessings, then I raised your destiny, then I paid the specials for you, and perhaps some of what he delayed in the remembrance, you may be presented, so all of us and God know.The following question: the guarantor in “two” is a vague guarantee, and seven heavens of his interpretation, as his saying: His Lord A man, and his benefits that if the obsession was clear, he was fooling and greater than to show first; Because if the spontaneity is spoken, the souls will be ever on the authority of it, and in the Bayan (P-144) after that heal after it, after the fragrance, and it was said: The meaning of the spectrum, and it was said: the collection of a sky, and the Arab face is the first, and the meaning of their level is their creation and its elimination of the glow and the virginity.* * * Fifth question: Know that the Qur’an has indicated that seven heavens are provided, and the companions of the body said that I approach us to the moon, and the sake The flower, then the sun, then the water of the sheikh, then the mud of the chest, and then the pulp of plow, they said: There is no way to the knowledge of this time, except for the one who is the first: This is that the beeps of the lower, if we pass between our eyesight and between the highest calamity, then they are as a single clause, and the sacrifice is distinguished from the one who is the one who is the one Mary, the whistle of Arad, and the light of the flower, the purity of the bodied, and the zebra Zahl, as the feet and the moon found the fools of the sixties.And the crown of the travelers of the flower, and the flower is embedded, and this path is on this way that indicates the inhabitants of the sun, and it is not the same It does not indicate that it is shown under the wickedness of the curtains, or by her because she does not be ashamed of something from her to the homes of the cararis of the frozen, when they are so, so they are, then they are the same One of them: some of them mentioned that he saw the flower as a casualty in the Shamsah newspaper, and this is weak; Because some of them claimed that in the face of the sun is a Levant, as he obtained the face of the moon.The second: The disagreement of the theorist, for it is a sense of the moon, Mercury, and Al -Zahra, and other than a sense of the Marsa and Al -Mashtari, and the sacrifice, and in the right of the sun, then it is the right of the sun.The sun must be flat between the two sections.This is what the majority said, except that Abu al -Rayhan said in his discharge to the separation of Al -Farghani: The disagreement of the view does not feel unless in the moon, so this was invalidated by the faces The sun is skeptical.And I know that the companions of the meteorology and the hearts of the body claimed that the wages are nine, for the seventy is this that we mentioned, and the eighth astronomy is the one who is the one who is the same As for the ninth astronomy, it is the great astronomer, while it moves on every day and night, and one is one with a closeness The constant is a slow stirring and stated that the fries do not move except with a move, so their king and the klak that are locked to these cars are fiercely moved, so there are no sins, so there is no fast, so there is no fast, so there is no fast He moves a slow movement and is the bearer of these constants, and this is the significance A weak from the faces: the first: why it is not permissible to say: the makers are burning with itself from others that they are in the body of another body?And this imitation does not spoil except with the corruption of the choice, and without it the excess of murder.And the second: We have been delivered, but it is not permissible to say: These are the cries, a muffle in the representatives of the cars and the cabinets are a ritual in their inhabitants, and that is not for you, and that is not for you.Eighth.And the third of it: Why is it not permissible for that astronomy under the moon, then the moon, so that it will be under the kirat of the cars, not above, for it was said: We see these cars.The constants and the spoiler are under the custody.We said: These are the cars, but the consequences of the consequences of the convergence are the closeness of the two poems, so if it is not permissible, it is not permissible to say: Period is a ritual in the eighth kingdom, which is above the zahl, and these are the proximity of the two poems that cannot be broken in the two poles, which cannot Do you think that you are under the moon?And this involvement is not barefoot, and then we say: Give you, this is the nine wages, so what is indicated by the denial of the adult king (P-145) Except this destiny, except that the significance of the evidence does not indicate the number of signs, which is achieved that some of those who are fulfilled from them said that it is not for them to be The constants are one or a kiosa, some of them are some of them, and I say: This involvement is located; Because the one who is inferred from the same reward is not only that it is said: Its movements are similar and when the matter was like that, it was a ritual in the same way.However, two.As for the first: because it is its movements, even if it is in the sense one, but it may not be in the right one; Because if we estimate that one of them is completing the role in six and thirty thousand years.And the other is completed by the one in the same way as one period of one year.Ten part of a thousand and one part of one part of one, and this destiny is what is not felt by the ten years, the hundred and the thousand, which does not feel it.And if that is an innervoyant, the piece will be lost from the leveling of the constants.As for the second: because the contents of the constants in the quantities of their movements are not required, they are required to be left in a single ka in a single hatred for the exaltation of its place, in a way that is in a way that is in a way.And if it is partner in the stories of its movements, and this is as they say in the representatives of more of the cries, then it is in its movements equal to the thorns of the garments, so so.And I say: This is the same as this saying It is not concluded with the possession of the rewards, so perhaps the rugged crime of the movement of the day is not a single crime, but rather a lot of dignity.Its awareness is fulfilled by us, or equal to release, but its equality is not required.Among the companions of the body who cuts off the afflictions of the last one other than this nine, then it is from the people who have proven a hatred, according to the reward of the reward, Wooh: The first: that the righteous of the greatest mileage and the different of the destiny is the one who was the one who was the monotheism of the milestone, the greatest of the mill is greater Oh, “Then there was a time in the time of the insured” And the last one, and this can be if it is between the ka of all and the reward of the constants is the last one that turns its poles around the katta of the whole, and the reward of the whole is the same Its poems around two poles of that ka, so he exposes its poles to turn to the side of the north, and it is reduced and wandered by the side of the south The day of the day is amended by the area of ​​the brokers, and that it will be separated from it, and it will be lost to the south, when the pole of the rituals raise the reward for the south, and to the north.As it is now.The second: that the heads of the meteorology were forced into severely in the place of the path of the sun on what is a source in the “books of the stars” even if it is a long time.Poishing that this return is in an equal or different aspect, and that he says in some of his sauce They mentioned in the causes of his disagreement two sayings: one of them: the saying of those who make the sun of suns The side is different from the point of the accustomed to disagree with its distance from the Age, so the time of the sun is different for it.The second: the saying of the people of Al-Hindi and China, and the abundance of the feet of the Romans, Egypt and the Levant: The reason is in which it is transmitted, and the king (P-146) is the brokers, and the ritual of the power of it.Abrachis that he was hurting this opinion and reminding the Paradise of Skandrani that the companions of the crime were the ones who believed in that, and that the point of it was the point And the delay of eight grades, and they said: The start of the movement from “cab” is a scourge from the whale to the first pregnancy, and he knew that this mixing is what he wakes up to you that there is no reason for it.The human being to the realization of these things and that it does not surround it except the knowledge of it and its creator and its creators, so it is obligatory to take advantage of it on the hearing evidence.If he said, "So do it indicate?" Mentation of seven heavens on the exile of the intense number?We said: The truth is to allocate the number to the remembrance that does not indicate the exile of the Zaid.The sixth question: His Excellency said: It is everything that indicates that it is their pursuit and the exalted cannot be And the rituals, unless he is aware of it surrounded by their parts and collections, and that indicates matters: one of them: the corruption of the saying of the philosophers who said: He does not know, And the authenticity of the words of the speakers, and that is because those who speak to the words of God be exalted with the parties that they said: God is the Almighty, and it is the best of God.And vengeance and every act of this face, for it is necessary and that it is a scholar of what he did, and this is the sign of its eyes that God is exalted in this place; Because he mentioned the creation of the heavens and the earth, then he spread on that as a world, and it was proven by this that the saying of those who speak in this deity and in this gossip and in this For the Qur’an.And the second: the corruption of the pronounced saying, and that is because it is his pursuit and the exalted, indicating that the Creator is for the woman on the way of appreciation and conflict, and it is necessary And with his conquest because his creator has specially specialized in destiny, and to specialize with certain destiny, it is imperative that it be in will, otherwise he will be made from the righteousness of the righteous Calculation of knowledge, and it has proven that the creator of the thing must be aware of it on the way of detailing.If the servant was found for the same action, he would have been aware of it and its conquest in the number, the quantum, and the entity.Its soul.And the third of it: the dismissed said: If you collect between this verse and between his saying: It is above every knowledgeable knowledge [Yusuf: 76] And according to every general knowledge, and his saying: He descended it with his knowledge [Women: 166] private, and the private is presented over the year.And God Almighty knows.
