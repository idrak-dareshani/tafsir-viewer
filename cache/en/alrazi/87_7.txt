The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: We will read you, so you will not forget except what God wants, he knows the wickedness and what is hidden.Peace be upon him, that this praise is not fulfilled and only completes the rule of what God has revealed to him from the Qur’an, so what indicated that the praise is the one For itself, then there was no crime, the Qur’an remembered in itself, fearing that he would forget, so God is removed from that fear of his heart, and he said: Institutions: The first question: The one said: “We will read you”, that is, we will make you a reader that we will inspire you to read Read it, and do not forget it.Live until he speaks to him, with the first fear of the forgetfulness, so the Almighty said: We will read you, so do not forget what we will teach you this Qur’an until you do not.Hurry up with the Qur’an before he is eliminated to you.And teaching is faced.One of them: that Gabriel, peace be upon him, will read the Qur’an to you until you keep it a memorizer that does not forget it.And the second: We explain your chest and strengthen your mind until you keep the one time that you do not forget.And the third of it: It is up to what he commanded in the beginning of the Surah by praise, as if he was upset, he said: He remains on that and grows upon him.It is in it your remembrance and the remembrance of your people and its gathering in your heart, and we will make you happy for the secret, which is the work of it.The second question: This verse indicates the miracle of two faces: The first: that he was an illiterate man, so he kept it for this book, and there is no one who does not Books, supernatural to be a miracle.The second: That this surah is one of the parents of what has come down with a king, so this is a news about a strange thing that is strange, contrary to the return, which will fall into the future, and this is the one who has come to the one who has been.It will be miraculous, but his saying: Do not forget, and some of them said: Do not forget the forbidden meaning, and the thousand is more for the twin His readers will be forgiven and disturbed, so he forgot him, except what God wants to forget him, and the famous saying is that this is a news and the meaning we will read you until you do not see you As you say, I will see you, so do not strive for any of the people, and the companions of this saying begged for the weakness of the first saying that that is the saying that there is no one who does not come This verse is that The forgetfulness is not appreciated only by God, so the arrival of the matter and the prohibition of it is valid, so it is necessary and that it is carried on the perseverance on the things that are not.And many (P-129) remembrance.And all of that is about the appearance of the memorizer.It is that a thousand make a further for the separation, which is also the disagreement of the original, and from it that if we made it a news, the meaning of the verse is in the view of God, I would not have it.It is meaning that God commanded him to keep the causes of the forgetfulness of the forgetfulness, which is the study and the readers, and this is not in the evil, and the most likely the same is the same as the first, and it is not the same, and it is not the same You move with it for your tongue to hurry with it [Resurrection: 16].As for his saying: Except what God wants, then they have two impersonations: one of them: that it is said: This is the discretion that it is not possible in the truth, and it is upon him, peace be upon him, and he did not forget that Peace be upon him, after this verse was descended from this verse, and on this estimation, the supplies will be from his saying: except what God wills: one of the things: one of the things: The word is what the Almighty said: Do not say anything that I am doing that tomorrow, except that God will be blessed [the cave: 23], as if he is the Almighty saying: I am with a scholar of all the knowledgeable In detail, I do not tell about the occurrence of something in the future, except with this word, so you and your nation, Muhammad, are upon it.And the second: Al -Farah said: It is the highest of what he wants to forget Muhammad, peace be upon him, except that the intended is the remembrance of this discretion that it is the highest, if it is not.He is upon him, as he said: And if our things, we will go to us who inspired us to you [Al -Israa: 86] Then we cut off that he is the Almighty, and he said: Let your work be liked with the fact that peace and blessings be upon him.The forgetfulness is the best of God and his benevolence, not from His strength.And the third of it: It is up to the one who mentioned this dedication, the Messenger of God ﷺ in everything that he descends from the one who was a little or a lot, or a lot, that it is that it was that of that It is in the formation, memorization, and awakening in all the positions, so the intended was the remembrance of this discretion of his meeting with peace be upon him.And its elevation: that the supply is from his saying: Except what God wants to deny the forgetfulness, as the man says to his companion: You are my loudness in what you have, but he will not Something.The second saying: that his saying: except what God wants to be exclusive in the truth, and on this estimation, the verse is enticed Wahwah: One of them: Al -Zajaj said: Except what God wants to forget, then he forgets and then remembers after that, then he has forgotten, but he remembers, so he will be remembered, and he will not forget, and he will be remembered, and he will not forget It was narrated that he fell into a verse in his readers in the prayer, so he calculated my father that she was dirty, and he asked him and said: I forgot her.And the second: A fighter said: Except what God wants to forget him, and that is what is meant by women here is a copy, as he said: We do not copy from a verse or we forget it with a good thing: God willing, to forget him on all of them, so he commands you that you not read it and not pray with it, so that it becomes a reason for forgetting it and its storms.And the third of it: that the meaning of its saying is: except what God wills the few and scarcity, and it is involved that this is not a few of the obligatory law From the obligatory women and did not remember it, it led to the vulnerability on the legs, and it is not permissible.As for the saying of the Exalted: He knows the wickedness and what is hidden in his face and Jahan: one of them: that the meaning is that they are greeting it with your wilderness in the readers with the readers of Jabr, the peace of the peace With the secret that is in your heart, which is that you are afraid of the forgetfulness, do not be afraid, because I am enough for you to be afraid.The second: that the meaning is: do not forget except what God wants to copy, for he knows the validity of the servants, so he will copy where he knows that the reconciliation is in the prayer.
