The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, and from where you came out, and your face is the ritual of the mosque, and it is for the right of your Lord, and God is unaware of what you do, and you will be done.The mosque is the forbidden, and wherever you are, and your faces will be wounded, so that people will not have a pilgrimage to you, except for those who have been wronged, so do not fear them and fear them and fear them You may be guided by you, know that the first thing in this verse is from the search that God Almighty said before these verses: We have seen your face in the heaven You are satisfied with it, and your face is the dominance of the mosque.They work and mention this second saying: (P-125), and from where you came out, then the one who has been lost, the mosque is the forbidden, and it is for the sake of your Lord, and what is the right of your Lord, and what is the right Thirdly, his saying: From where you came out, he gave your face to be the dominant mosque, and wherever you were, then they will be your faces, so that it will not be for you, so that it is not for you to do so.The repetition is more or not?Scientists have statements.One of them: that the conditions are three.First: that the human being in the mosque is the forbidden.And the second: that it is removed from the mosque, and it is in the country.And the third of it: that it is removed from the country to the train of the earth, for the first verse is the first in the first state, the second on the second, and the third over the third; Because it was deluded that the closeness has a prohibition that I do not prove to the servant, for the sake of the removal of this illusion, God has repeated these verses.And the second answer: that it is a chain of transmission, but it restored three times because it was suspended every time, increasingly increased, but at the first time, he showed that the people of the book know that Muhammad ﷺ and the command of this kiss is a right; Because they witnessed that in the mourning and the evangelization, but in the second time, he indicated that it is an adult that testifies that this is a right, and the testimony of God is the right to be a right He is really, and in the third time, he indicated that he did so, so that people would not have an argument for you For every one of the same times, one of these benefits, and his counterpart, is the saying of the high This is from God to buy a little thues to him, and they have a loyalty to them from what their hands have written, and they have what they gain from what they gain [Al -Baqarah: 79].And the third answer: that he said in the first verse: Let us accept you before you will be satisfied with it, and you are the one who is the one who is the mosque, and where you were, then they were.Perhaps he is seriously wicked that he has done That is a request for Muhammad's satisfaction ﷺ; Because he said: Let us give you a kiss that you will accept, so God Almighty removed this corrupt delusion with his saying: And from where you came out, then you are the same That is, we have turned you into this kiss with the incest As the kiss of the woven, who is evaluated by the deceased of passion and miles, then he is the highest, he said a third: From where I was brought out, then the face of the face of the sake You were, and your faces are his wounds, and what is meant is that this kiss is in all of the Azaminah and the categories, and do not take care of that, and that will become the same as the one who is in the authority of you.The righteous verse is a matter of milestones in all the places, and the second is a matter of milestones in all the custody and the place, and the third is a matter of milestones in all of the people in all of this The bit.And the following answer: that the first matter is counted by its honor to them with the kiss that they loved and the kiss of their father, Ibrahim - peace be upon him -.And the second is a couple with the words of the Almighty: and for every face it is its money, that is: for every owner of a call and a mourning before it is directed to it, then it is directed to it.God Almighty is that it is a right and that is his saying: And from where you were brought out, and your face is the dominance of the mosque, the forbidden, and it is the right of your Lord.And the third is a decision of the cut of God, the exalted of the pilgrimage of those who have been in the way of the kiss, so this was three times, with each one of the same, the one who is the same.To be said: This is the kiss, for it is the kiss that you were distracted, and then it is said: This is the kissing, for it is the truth, not before the passion, and it is the one who says: Then it is said: This is the kissing, for you are in your obligation to make the pilgrims of Juda from you, and this is the relic of this (P-126) who is the place as the righteous in the words of the saying: Your Lord is lying [Rahman: 13], as well as what has been repeated in his words, the Almighty: that there is a verse and what was the most believers of those believers [Poets: 121].And the fifth answer: that this is the first of the creatures that the copies appeared in it on our part, so the need called for the renovation for the sake of affirmation and the discerning Benate.As for the saying of the Exalted: What is God with the heavie of what you do means what these people do that are the ones who are the ones who conceal the truth and they know it and enters it With their saying: What they have before their kisses, which they were on [Al -Baqarah: 142], and that he had missed his birth and the religion of his fathers, for God is a scholar, and this is the knowledge On the authority of it and its weakness.* * * As for his saying: La You have a pilgrimage to you, in which it is in the first question: the first question: I know that these words are delusional pilgrims and words presented before in the chapter of the kiss of It shows that this argument is now removing the heels, and in how this argument is narratives.One of them: that the Jews said: We are afraid of our religion and followed our kisses.And the second: They said: Did he not know Muhammad, where would he go in his prayers until he guided him.And the third of it: that the Arabs said: He used to say: I am on the debt of Abraham and now he left the tour to the Kaaba, and whoever leaves the direction to the Kaaba, then he has left the religion - So this is the way of the faces and asking them to stabbed in his law - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - except that God Almighty knew that the righteousness is in that, and it is obligatory for them to do so The sanctuary for the reconciliation in the debt; Because their saying does not affect the interests, and we have shown us before that reconciliation, and it distinguishes those who follow it with the owner of those who resided on it He appeared only with this sex and when he was transmitted - peace and blessings be upon him - to the city, the reconciliation changed, and the rule is required to turn to the kaaba, so he said to the kaab.Exalted: Like people, there will be an argument that means that suspicion that they mentioned will be removed from this manifestation, and when they have no one, he is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who is in them.When this manifestation is with the last semi, and it is the saying of some Arabs: Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - has returned to our religion in the Kaaba and will return to our religion, and he will return to our religion With this suspicion and the one who is rejected by it for the sake of ignorance and infidels, and that is an injustice to the soul on what the Almighty said: The evil is the shadow of the oligarch Hope: Except those who have been wronged.The second question: Nafaa's reader: (let it) leaves the hammer, and every deadly proud of it before it is broken, so it will turn it on, and the rest is with them.The third question: for no place in a position, and the one in it (wallow), that is, wali, for no, and the dagger said the estimation: I know you so that there is no one for you.The following question: It was said: People are the people of the book about Qatada, and Al -Raba’i and it was said: It is on the general.The fifth question: here is a question, which is that the likeness of these people who have been wronged themselves are not with an argument, so how is it permissible for the sake of the argument, I say.The first: It is a condemnation, and then on this saying, the question can be paid from the faces: (P-127) The first face: that the pilgrimage is as it is true, it is true, it is true that it is true.Also, invalid, God Almighty said that they were exhausted by their Lord [Al -Shura: 16] and said Hope: Whoever needs you, after what came to you from the knowledge [Al -Imran: 61] and the argument is that each one of them will be repeated on his owner, and this requires that it be the same With Hajj; Because the pilgrimage, I derive it from his pilgrimage, if he is upon him, every words that he intends to do with the dominance of others, so it is a pilgrimage, and some of them said: It is a matter The human being takes it as a person to himself in proof or heroes, then it is a pilgrimage, and if it is proven that the suspicion may be called an argument, it was the same.The second face: In the report that it is a condemnation, it is connected: that the people who want the people of the book, then they found it in their writers that he - upon him the prayer and peace be upon him They turned, their pilgrimage was spoiled except those who were wronged because they were dead.On the authority of my father.The third direction: that when they wanted that suspicion, it is possible that it is a pilgrimage that God called a pilgrimage based on their belief, or for perhaps he is the same.The fourth face: He wanted the argument for the argument and the argument, and he said: Like people will not have an argument for you, except those who wronged them, then they will argue with you.The second saying: that it is an interruption, and it is meaning: but those who have been wronged from them are suspended by the similarity, and they put it in the place From the knowledge, except to follow the suspicion [An -Nisa: 157] and the jungle said: “And they are disadvantaged in them, so that they will not be aware of them, so there is no one from the grace of the custody, and it is: He is said to have a right to me except for the transgression, meaning: but he is aggressive and oppressed, and his counterpart is also his saying: I am not afraid of the one who is the one who is the Messenger of The day of the day of God, except for those who have mercy on [Hood: 43], and this type of words is usual, famous for the Arabs.The third saying: Abu Ubaidah claimed that (except) in the sense of waw, as if he was upset, he said: Like people will not have an argument for you, and those who have been wrong, and those who are wrong, ∗∗∗ The age of your father is only the chapters, meaning: and the two parties.The righteous saying: Qatarb said: Mawdi (those who) is a failure; Because it is a replacement of the kaf and the mim in you, as if it was said: Lest, there is no pilgrimage to you except those who wronged, then it will be a pilgrimage to them, and they are the one who said: Witness is a struggle.As for his saying, “Do not be afraid and fear them, the meaning do not fear those who offer his remembrance of those who curse, argue and argue, and do not fear them, and do not fear them They do not harm you and fear me, it means warning my punishment, if you are just as much as I have, and I have been imposed on you, and this verse is indicated that the duty is to the one who is obligatory And you see him to set out between his eyes, the fear of God, and that He knows that he is not in the hand of creation, and that the heart of the heart is not in them, (P-128), and the kidnapper is not wrapped in them.As for his words, the Almighty is: And to fulfill my blessing to you, they have disagreed with the attachment of the mother to his face A pilgrimage, and my blessings be upon you, and God has shown that he turned them into this kaaba for the two wise.One of them: to deduct their pilgrimage to it.The second: to complete the grace, and the father of Muslim bin Bin Bahar al -Asfahi has been shown in that of the grace, which is that the people used to break the way of what they were They do, and when he turned ﷺ to the house of the sanctuary, their right is weakened by a heart, and for that the Prophet ﷺ loves to turn into the kaab because of what is in it, so it is from the honor of this.The position of the grace.And the second: that the attachment of the mother is deleted, meaning: to complete the grace to you and my will to give you your command.And the third of it: to be overlooked by a capable cause, as if it was said: I fear me for your success, and that I will be blessed with you, and the first saying is that the one is true, for the one who is the one who is the one who is the first, and the first said: He was revealed to the death of the Messenger of God ﷺ: Today I have completed your religion and I have fulfilled my blessings on you [Al -Ma’idah: 3] So he showed that the blessing of the blessing is that the blessing is that Before that day in many years, many in this verse: and my grace was fulfilled on you.The blessing is the entry of paradise.And know that the one who told him about my father - may God have mercy on him - from doubting the prayer of the Messenger and the prayer of his nation to the house of the sanctuary, then if it is the one who does not want it That has happened; Because something of the Qur’an is not indicative in it on that time to what he has, and if he wants him to deny it originally, then after; Because the news is in this approximately one of the frequent, and the father is a Muslim - may God have mercy on him - to prevent frequency, and when he says: It is not valid in Al -Tawalil On our parts on the news of the one and God knows.
