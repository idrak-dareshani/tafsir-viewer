The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: If they meet those who believed, they said, “We believed in us, and if some of them, some of them have been removed to each other.They know that God knows what they are pleased with and what they declare.May God be pleased with him, as soon as the opponents of the book of the book were if they met the companions of Muhammad ﷺ they said to them: We believed in the one who believed in him and we witnessed that your friend is true He bought him and described him in our book, then if some of them are removed to some, the presidents said to them: Do you talk to them with what God has shown to you in his book, and he will be blessed.The violator, if it is recognized by the health of the teeth and is recognized by the testimony of Al -Tawarah on the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ, then there is no pilgrimage to that, so there was no crime, and it was some of them.That is when Muhammad ﷺ and his companions, Al -Qafal said: His saying: So God has shown you from the saying of them, so that it was shouted at the same His request was easy for him.As for his saying: When your Lord is in his face, he is a face: one of them: that they made their arguments with him and his saying is in your book like this as a pilgrimage to God, and he does not say that he is in God By God, this is in one way.And the second: Al -Hasan said: That is, to need you in your Lord, because the argument, while God is obligatory to follow the messengers, it is true that it is described as a need in it.And the third of it: The deaf said: What is meant is the day of resurrection, and when you ask, then this is increased in your time From a confession to the truth, then he fell asleep, and the people were firm, so the people were believed that the appearance of that is what increases the exposure of their illness in the last.And its booster: (P-126) said the judge, Abu Bakr: The needy person may take it and be his abuse from the purification of that pilgrimage, the argument of the sacrifice of His impotence from him is the religion and the advice, so he would cut the excuse of his deafness and decide the Hajj of God on him, so the people said with the immortality of the time of the time of the Their pilgrims in the mourning, and they can be able to do so on the face of religion and advice; Because whoever recalls the pilgrimage to this direction, he may say to his friend, I have answered you with God and I stayed on you with the Hajj between me and between me Your soul, and if you are united, you were the losing disappointed.Fifth: Al -Qafal said: It is said: So that I have a scholar, that is, in my belief and judgment, and this is when the Shafi’i is permissible, and when Abu Hanifah is forbidden, that is, in the ruling of them, that is, in the ruling of them With your Lord any To make the pilgrims with that evidence in the ruling of God.And some of the scholars said: “So, when they did not come to the martyrs, then those of God are the liars.He brings the testimonies that he must be judged by the ruling of the liars, even if it is true.As for his saying: Do you not understand, in his face and faces: one of them: that he returns to the believers, as if he is up to the Almighty, he said: Do you not understand that you have not mentioned it to you?Reamine you in their faith, and it is the saying of goodness.And the second: that he returned to them, as if when some of them were released with some, they said to them that you speak to them with what he returns and with him and you will not be lost It is worthy of what you are on.This face appears because it is from the completeness of the story about them, so it is not directed to his behavior from them to others.As for the saying of the Exalted: First, they know that God knows what they are pleased with and what they declare, and he said: The Almighty knows the secret and the globe, so God blessed them with it.The second: that they did not know that, so they wanted them to say this saying that they think, so they know that they have a Lord who knows their secret and their adolescents, and that they do not believe Their hypocrisy, and on all of the two words, this words are a reward for them from hypocrisy, and for the will of each other with some of the evidence of the prophecy of Muhammad.And the closest that the spectacles that are addressed are those who were aware of that; Because it is hardly said on the way of the dirt: first, Katt and Katt know, except when he is a scholar of that thing, and that is the thing that is for him, and he said: Jews, how are they to be pleased with their brothers, the forbidden from the appearance of the evidence of the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ and they are not like the hypocrites who do not know, and they do not know A scientist with the secret and the informative, so they saw them from this side.The judge said: The verse is indicated by matters: one of them: that it is up to him, if he is the creator of the acts of worshipers, so how is it true that they will be removed from those sayings and verbs.And the second: that it indicates the validity of the pilgrims and the view, and that it was the way of the companions and the believers, and that it was a phenomenon when he said that he said to some of them.And the third of it: it indicates that the argument may be obligatory because when they were known to the health of the supply and its insults on what indicates the prophecy of the Prophet, the Prophet is not.Their bonding of their prophecy was obligated, and if they prevented one of your two submitted, the significance was not fulfilled.And the one who is seen: it indicates that the one who comes with disobedience with the knowledge of it is a disobedience to be the greatest of generosity and a richness, and God knows best.
