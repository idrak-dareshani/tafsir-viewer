The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Whoever is afraid of a person who is infected or sinned, then reconciles among them, so he does not sin against him.Know that it is up to the one who replaces those who change the commandment, indicating that what is meant by that is the same is to replace it from the right to the falsehood, but if it changes it from the right He was better, and he is what is meant by his saying: Whoever is afraid of a person who is in kind or a sin, then reconciles them; Because the righteousness requires a beating of the trial and the change, so the exaggeration of the difference was mentioned between this trial and among that After their partnership in their being, two and two years of age, so that it is not possible that their ruling is one in this section, and here are the questions: the question: With a ritual (disorganized) with tension, and those with lightness, and they are two languages: a commandment and an essential in one meaning.* * * The second question: Al -Jannaf: the molice in the matters, and the origin of the entirety is about the level, it is said: the lane is softened by breaking the noun in the past, and opened it in the past, Likewise, it is exalted, and it is the saying of the Almighty: it is not a condemnation of ours (P-57) [Al-Ma’idah: 3] and the difference between the paradise and the sin is that it is the mistake of the one who does not know.* * * The third question: in the words of the Almighty: Whoever is afraid of saying: One of them: that what is meant by him is fear and fear.If it is said: fear is valid in an expected matter, and the commandment is forth, so how can it be attached to fear.The answer is from his faces: one of them: that what is meant is that this reconciliation, if the testator, testifies, then the signs of the paradise, which is the inclination of the truth of the truth, appeared from it.Tawil or witness from it, intentionally, that he will increase, or he will be fulfilled, or the right is to be fulfilled, or he is amended from the one who deserves it, so it is a matter The realization of the commandment is taken in the righteousness; Because the command of the matter when the appearances of his corruption and before the report of his corruption will be easier, so he commented on the exalted, without the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge The commandment and the witness attended the face of the chastity: I want to recommend to the promises without the relatives and that I am more so that it is not annexed to the Ziyah He is a fulfillment of the Ziyah, for that he becomes a disagreement from the mutation and insecurity, not a heroic to him, and for that he said: He who is afraid of a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a person who is afraid I think and did not suspend it with knowledge.The second face in the answer: that if he recommends the face that we mentioned, but it is permissible that the person recommended that the commander not to be blessed, but it will be annihilated, but it will be annihilated.Because the recommended is not what he did, he has no return from the commandment and its abomination with leadership and the deficiency, When it was like that, the paradise and the sin were not known; Because the permanence of his dirt is prevented from being cut on it, so he commented it with fear.The third face is in the answer: that it is possible that the commandment is stable and the testator died, so from that it is permissible to fall between the heirs and the one who has the right to the authority of the authority, When that was expected, the ruling of the paradise and the ingredient was not stable, so it was correct that the exalted be suspended with the fear and the demise of the yaks, so that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the The meaning of fear, even if the first face is the strongest.The second saying: In the interpretation of his Almighty saying: Whoever is afraid of any who knows.And fear and fear are used in the sense of knowledge and that because fear is a expressive case Many, for this is true to release the name of each of them on the other, and on this interpretation, the meaning of the verse is that the dead if he sinned in his will or a neighbor, then he is a woman On those who know that he will change him and return him to the righteousness after his death, and this is the saying of Ibn Abbas, Qatada and Al -Raba’i.The following question: It was mentioned that the lania is the mistake and the sin is the baptism, and it is known that the mistake is in the right of others that it is obligatory in its heroes, so it is not the same.And the baptism is in that, so from this direction, it is equal to the glory and the one between the two things.* * * As for his words, he said: He reconciled between them in it: Dahir is that he is the commander who must be in the commandment, and he may enter the witness, and it may be what is meant by someone who takes care of that after the death of it, or from it, or from it Whoever commands the well -known.So all these are entering the words of the exalted The commander and the witness are the first of this (P-58) to cost and that; Because they are proven by the commandment, then they were attached to it more severe.The second question: for a saying that he says: Al -Sadir is in his saying: So he reconciled between them, and it is necessary and that it is domesticated to a precedent.And his answer: that there is no suspicion that what is meant is among the people of the commandments; Because he said: Whoever is a recommended, he will be denied by those who have the commandment, and he became as if they were mentioned, and he reconciled to say the Almighty: The two sayings: What is meant, and he reconciles the people of the will and the inheritance, and that is to increase the commander in the commandment on the destiny of the third, so the reconciliation is in the way That is, and this saying is weak from the faces: one of them: that the commander is preserved, but it indicates the people of the commandment, not on the heir.And the second: The paradise and the sin do not enter into more than the third; Because that, when it is not permissible, only with the satisfaction, its remembrance became a male, and he does not need its invalidity into a solution; Because he is the appearance of heroes.* * * The third question: In the Bayan Keviyyah, this is the righteousness, and we are the ones: the first search: in the Bayan Kayfiyyah, this is before, before this, this is the same.So we say that this is that of the paradise and the sin, either with an increase, a decrease or a dimension, so its reforms, but it is to remove these three things.The second research: In the way of this prayer, after that this is the verse of the human beings, so we say: The paradise and the sin are here, it is on the authority of the face of it.He is trying to prevent money from the inheritance, either by the remembrance of acknowledgment, or with a commitment of a contract, for it is forbidden from it.And from it to recommend more than the third.It is to recommend for the promises and in the relatives the intensity of a need.And from it to recommend with the lack of money and the many children to otherwise from the faces.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: He does not sin against him, and he has two questions: It is upon him, so how can he be able to say: He does not sin against him.His answer is from his faces: The first: that he is upset when he mentioned the sin of the principle at the beginning of the verse, and this is also from the severity between the first of the first, and that it is not the first, and that it is not the first, Because he returned the commandment to justice.The second: When the reconciliation was shortened by the commandments, and that is difficult for the recommended to him and they have a sin in it, he removed the suspicion and said: So do not sin against him.The third: indicated that with the commandment and the martyrdom is not valid, and that when it is changed to the truth, and if it is free of the commandment, he will not be guided by him, and if he is in the authority of him, then he will be in it.And he made a way to his affairs, who loved those who hated him; Because that is the illusion of ugliness, then God has shown, glory be to God, that this is good for his saying: He does not sin against him.And the quarter: that the righteousness between the group is in which it needs to be more than the saying, and it is afraid that it will be disturbed by some of what is not empty of the saying and the verb, and the verb is not.Reconciliation in this sex if his intention is beautiful.The second question: This verse indicated the permissibility of reconciliation between the disputes if he is afraid of those who want to reconcile the expulsion of that displacement to the matter of the matter.* * * As for his saying: God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.Is this speech?And his answer is from his face My mercy and my rewards are connected to you with the fact that you bore many And the second: It is necessary that what is meant is that that is the recommended who is presented to the lane and the sin when his will is reconciled With his preference.And the third of it: that the reconciliation may need to give the righteousness to sayings and actions that the first was left, so if he knew it, he would not be exalted that his suppression is not only the righteousness, then it is not the same.Because he is a merciful forgiveness.
