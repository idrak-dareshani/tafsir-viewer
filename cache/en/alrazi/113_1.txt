The Quranic researcher (P-173) (Surah Al-Falaq).Fifth verses, civil.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.﷽ His Excellency said: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash in which there are questions: He has what he does not meet in himself and his attributes, and that was one of the greatest obedience, as if the servant said: Our God is this obedience is great, and I do not have a trustworthy, so he said: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash, that is, seek refuge in God, and come to him until he will agree with you for this obedience to the most complete faces.And the second: that the infidels when they asked the Messenger about the lineage of God and his description, as if the Messenger, peace be upon him, said: How can they survive from these ignorance, who did not With you?And God said: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash, that is, seek help from me until I protect you from their evil.And the third of it: as if he is up to say: Whoever sought refuge in my house was honored and made him safe and I said: Whoever entered it was safe, then you are also to me The Lord of the Clash.The second question: They disagreed that it is permissible to seek help from the righteousness and deeds or not?From them he said: It is permissible and begun with its face He heals you.And the second: Ibn Abbas said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ teach us all of them and the fever is this supplication: in the name of God, the generous, I seek refuge in the great of God Fire.And the third of it: peace be upon him said: “Whoever enters a sickness, his term is not attended, and he said: I ask God, the Great, the Lord of the Great Throne, to heal you.” And he pushed it: On the authority of peace be upon him, he said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ If he entered a sick person, he said: Perhaps (P-174) the dress of the people of the people, heal you, you are not healing.” Fifth: On the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ was the good of goodness and goodness, saying: I will give you the full words of God from all of the Satan And he says: This is how my father was the one who forgot his two sons.And its sixth: “Othman ibn Abi al -Aas al -Qafi said: I came to the Messenger of God and in my pain, he would have almost invalidated me, so the Messenger of God said:“ Make you, God, and say: ” With the best of God and his ability from the evil of what I found seven times, I did that, so I can reveal God.And he pursued it: “It was narrated that peace be upon him, if he traveled, then he would say a house that says: O earth, my Lord and your Lord God seek refuge in God from your evil and the evil of what is in you I seek refuge in God from a lion, black, alive, and closer, and from The evil of the country and a father and what was born.And he wiped with it the place that dispersed.They are divided and on their Lord, they rely on them.”And peace be upon him said: The unknown that does not know its entitlements, but it did not have a source of relief, so we do not forbid it, and they differed in the relationship, so I said: And he gave up to him.Peace be upon him, peace be upon him.Suffering it, if he complains about the worshipers and wipes his hand, so when the Messenger of God disagreed with him On his own.Akrama: He does not want to spoil, not to be wiped, and do not complicate.I am helping you, Abu Muhammad.He wipes and does not complicate, as if he went in it until God has made the junction in the contract from what is seeking from him, so he must be from him The belief is only a defamatory if it is a charming magic with the ears and the eternity, but if this junction is for the basis of the aspirations of the aspects and the eternity, it is not a forbidden *.* He is the Almighty, he said in the key to the readings: So seek refuge with God and said here: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clashs and in another position: And say, Lord, I seek refuge in you from the whispers of the people: [69] The words of God is complete) and there is no doubt that the best of the names of God is God, and the Lord may be called on others.When the matter is with the time, he did not say: I seek refuge in God, but he said: The Lord of the Clashs?The Qur’an, so seek refuge in God [Al -Nahl: 98] Rather, he commanded him to seek refuge there for the sake of the Qur’an, but rather he commanded him to seek refuge in this way, for this is the sake of this.And the body is about magic, and the first important is greater, so there is no crime that is the great name.And the second: that the Satan is the state of your prevention from worshiping is more exaggerated in the delivery of harm to your body and your soul, so the male of the name (P-175) is the greatest.And the third of it: that the name of the Lord refers to education, as if he made the rabies of God to Him when he presented a way to his rabies to him in the following time, or if the servant said: And the charity is your letters, so do not delude me, and do not disappoint my hope.And the one that is: that by rabting it has become a dominant in charity, and the honesty is a obligatory.Fifth: that this surah is the last of the Qur’an, so he remembered to memorize the Lord, alert him to his grace, and do not cut off from you, and he will give him to you The Qur’an was concluded at the name of God, where he said: The King of the People is the God of the People [People: 3] We said: It is good for it, and it is the one who is the Almighty.For the whims of the pipe, it is like the accompanying father who says: Return to your tasks to your companionship, who is like the sword of the hero and the fire of the burning fire for you So this is one of the greatest types of promise with charity and education.And the sixth of it: As if the truth said to Muhammad, peace be upon him: your heart is not for me, so do not enter the love of others, and for you, and do not remember it for me, and you will be reminded of it.With the time of others, and if you want anything, then you will not ask it except from me.He said: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash, for I am the one who described myself that I am the creator of the pharaoh, and that I am the love of love and nuclei, and I did not do these things except for you These are the things for your sake, do I not protect you from pests and fear.* * * The raised question: they mentioned in: (Al -Falaq) and faces: one of them: that it is the morning and it is the saying of the most of the two.In the sense of a verb, it is said: It is the first of the rapture and the difference of the morning and its specialization in the dedication to its face: Every world is also appreciated by the world, all that he fears and fears.The second: that the soil is like an example for the coming of the vineyard, so that the human being in the night is waiting for the sake of the morning, as is the caliph, it will be a picnic success.The third: that the morning is like a lottery, for the human being is in the darkness.The captivity finds every sickness and lightness lightly at the time of magic, for the right of his grace says: Say: I seek refuge in a Lord who gives me the sake of the sake of the question.Al -Rabaa: Some of them said: The peace be upon him, when he was thrown into the gibs, and his knee was painful, and he was a hardship, so he did not like him Jabriel, peace be upon him, with the permission of God, asks him and commands him to pray for his Lord, and he said: O Jabril, I pray that you and I believe, so I will pray for me, and I will not be a jab.It is from the harm, and when I repented, Jabril said: I also invite and believe you, and Joseph asked his Lord to reveal the harm from the whole family of From a sickness, except for a lightness in the end of the night, and it was narrated that his supplication is in the forehead: my promise in my intensity, my insult in my hearts, and my will be my hardship The answer of my prayers, and my God, and God, my fathers, Ibrahim, and Isaac, and the punishment of the most merciful of my years, and the weakness of my knees, and the lack of my trick, O neighborhood, O Qayyum, O, Fifth: Perhaps the morning is to be mentioned in this position because it is the time of the obligatory prayer and the answer of the angels, as if he says: Say: I seek refuge in It is about all of the dignitaries.Sixth: It is enticed that he specialized in the morning, because he is a resurrection from the Day of Resurrection; Because creation is like the mother and the role as graves, then some of them come out from his house, a boundary, naked, who does not stop him, and for those who were indifferent, then he will go to the love, So the carrots were presented to him and the people rise between his hands, such as on the day of resurrection, some of them are in a man who is a disgrace to the dress of piety, and he will be made to the king, His Lord in the world became a king of obstacle (P-176), which is presented to him.The seven: It is impeded that it is the highest of the sacrifice, because it is the time of the universal prayer for the conditions of resurrection, for the prayer in the prayer reminds the resurrection of the day of the day.For the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Mutaffifin: 6] and the readers in prayer remember the reading of the books, and the kneeling in prayer is reminded of the resurrection of its saying: Naksu, their head His saying is mentioned: and they call for prostration, so they do not seek [the pen: 42] and the lords remember his saying: and every nation is seen as a custody [Al -Jathiya: 28], so the servant is: You saved me from the injustice of the night, so let me be from these horrors, but I was special and the time of the morning prayer; Because it has more honorable to what he said: The Qur’an was a witness [Al -Israa: 78], meaning that the angels of the night and the day are attended.The eighth: that the time to seek forgiveness and the loss of what he said: and those who seek forgiveness with magic [Al -Imran: 17].The second saying in Calf: It is a expressions of everything that God wills like the land of the plant: God is the grace and the nuclei [cattle: 95] and the mountains are from the eyes, and from the stones of what is from what is from what is from what is from what is from what is from the stones, and from what is from what is from what is from the stones of what is from what is from the stones Rain and wombs are about the children, the eggs from the chick, and the hearts from the knowledge, and if you contemplate the creation, it will be found to you that it is more than a decrease, but it is a shadow, but it is a shadow.The provision, and you have proven that God was in the strongest, and there was nothing with him the bit, so as if he was the one who was the one who ran the sailors of the darkness of the nursing, the lights of creation, and the light of the people, and the light of the people.Clashs, and this interpretation is close to the faces: one of them: that the existence is either the Creator or the creation, so if we are pleased with this interpretation, it is as if he said: He said: The possibilities, and the component of all the events and the inventions, will be the greatest in it, and the morning is one of the inner matters in this sense.And the second: that every supply is either obligatory for its own or the possible for itself, and the place for itself is that it is in a way A influence in which he affects the state of his resurrection and keeps him in the state of his survival, because the case is the state of his survival, it is limited to the influence, and the rabting is a sign, not to the state of the state, but not to the state of the state, but not to the state As if he says: You are not in need of the state of seizures, only in the event of seals and the state of survival with the self and in all the characteristics, so he said: “The Lord of the Falf.” He promised him the status of Al -Hadath and the survival in what is in the case and the existence of the self and the adjectives, and the secret of the truce does not describe the evils of the evil except when this is the same.And the third of it: that the deposit and the formation in the darkness is more difficult than it in the light, as if it says: I am the one who did what I do before the lights of the lights and the appearance of the lights and the appearance It comes only with the complete knowledge and the ruling, and the reference is by saying: He is the one who depicts you in the wombs, how is he who will not be God, but he is the dear.[6] The third saying: It is a valley in hell or a forehead in it from their saying because of what I have aspire Dhimma and what they are in the fee of live, so he said: I do not come, is it not behind them the clips, and it was said: What is the clap?He said: A house in Hell if it is opened, all the people of the fire shouted from the intensity of his freedom, but rather he specialized in the remembrance of us; Because he is the one who is like this is the great torment that is out of the limit or the delusions of creation, then it was proven that his mercy is greater, and he is full of it Honorable torment I seek refuge in your mercy that is the greatest, the whole, the fullness, the precedent, and the oldest of your torment.
