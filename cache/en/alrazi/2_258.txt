The researcher of the Quran, his transgression: Did you not see the pilgrim, who was broken in his Lord, that God has given him the king, when Abraham said my Lord who lives and dies.With the sun of the past This is God after her death, and God died for him a hundred years, then he sent him, he said: How did you live?Sign it, look at your life, and make you a sign for people, and look at the bones..Know that he is the highest of the three stories: the first of them in the Bayan is the proof of knowledge by the obstacles, the second and the third in the proof of the wise, the spread, the mission, the mission, and the one.With the king of his time, and it is this verse that we have interpreted, so we say: As for his saying, the Almighty is: Did you not see it, it is a word that the addressee stands from it The question (P-20) is not said, as it is said: Did you not see it so that how can it be made, meaning: Have you seen as a guarantee in his makers like this.As for his saying: To the one who Hajj Ibrahim in his Lord, he said Mujahid: He is the son of Bin Kanan, and he is the first to be forced and claimed the suspicion, and they were dispersed in this time.When the fractures of idols before the meeting in the fire on a fighter, and it was said: After staying in the fire.And the risky argument, it is said: His Hajj is his argument, that is, his predominance and his victory, and the guarantee in his saying: In his Lord, he leads to go back to the authority of Abraham, To the appellant, and the first appearance, as he said: His people needed him, he said: “Do you need me in God [Al -Anam: 80] and the meaning and his people needed his Lord.As for his saying: that God has given him the King, then know that in the verse two sayings: The first: that the distraction is in his giving to him to Abraham, it means that God is up to the authority of His Excellency ﷺ The saying of Jajah: The first: His Exalted, the Exalted: We have come to the rituals of the book and the ruling, and we came to them a great king [Al -Nasa: 54], meaning: The second: It is not permissible for the king to pay off the disbelievers, and to claim the division for itself.And the third: that the redeeming of the guerrillas to the closest of the two mentioned, and Abraham is the closest of the masculine to this guerrilla, so this is the opposite.And the second saying, which is the saying of the interpreters: that the guerrilla is based on that human being who Hajj Abraim.And they answered the first pilgrimage that this verse is indicative of the king's obtaining for the family of Ibrahim, and there is no significance in it The king is the prohibition of peace be upon him.And on the second pilgrimage that the person is intended for the king, we are able, capable, and simplicity in the world, and the sense indicates that it may be given to the infidel, and this meaning is not.It is said: He is the Almighty, the king gave him if he was a believer, and then after that he disbelieved in God Almighty?.And on the third pilgrimage, that the ritual of peace be upon him, and if the one is the one who is mentioned, but the many narratives are and it is and that the one who was the authority of the wicked was from This side.Then those who say this saying about them from his faces: The first: that his saying is up to the Almighty: that God has given him the king, he will take the interpretations of three, and all of them are three, and all of them are three, We said: The guerrilla is a good to the king, not to Abraham, and one of those interpretations is that the meaning be Hajj Ibrahim in his Lord, for the sake of God, the king, on the authority of God And he inherited the arrogance and the Atto, so it is a pilgrimage to that, and it is known that this is a good king, and the second interpretation is that the meaning is that he made it a pilgrimage in his Lord His Lord, the king, as it is said: so that so, so that I was good at him, he wants to reflect what he must have to be loyal to the sake of charity, and his counterpart: Your sustenance is that you are lying [Al -Waqi'a: 82] This is the interpretation of the Prophet, so it is obligatory for him to purify the pilgrimage before the royalty of the king, and the king of the king, He does not meet him with the purification of this severe Atto, except after the great king obtained it, so you have proven that he does not evaluate the saying of God: And it is interpreted unless you carry it on the strong king.The second argument: that the intended of this verse is like the state of Abraham ﷺ in the appearance of the supplication to the true religion, and when the infidel was a vigil, and this was a vile The meaning is complete if Abraham is a king, and when the infidel was a king, then the destiny is obligatory to what we mentioned.(P-21) The third pilgrimage: What was mentioned by Abu Bakr Al-Asam, which is that Abraham ﷺ If he was the king, the infidel would not be able to kill one of the two men, and he will be left.He prevented him from him more than that, but he must be like a refuge until he does not do so.A king and sultanate in religion and the ability to purify the miracles, and that infidel was a king who was powerful and loyal to the darkness; For this reason, a mother was able to kill one of the two men, and it is permissible, so it is permissible to say: Rather, he killed one of the two men, and the choice was to him, and he did not.Ali, or for the sake of the religion And keep it.Also, his saying: I revive a news and a promise, and there is no evidence in the Qur’an that he did it, so this is what is related to this question.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: His Lord, my Lord, who lives and dies, said: The first question is: The back is that this is a question of a preceding question, and there is no one who is not.It is known that the Prophet, peace be upon them.Peace, when he said: The Messenger of the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Shua’ar: 16], Pharaoh said: And the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Shua’ar: 23] So Moses, peace be upon him, was praised by the evidence of God.The heavens and the earth [the poets: 24], so it is the most apparent that Abraham claimed the message, so we said: Who is your Lord?Abraham said: My Lord who lives and dies, except that the presenter is deleted, because the location is indicative of it.The second question: the evidence of His Excellency, peace be upon him, was in the end of health, and that is because there is no way to know the knowledge of God, except with the medium of the verb of the one who does not do it.Qadrin, life and death as well; Because the creation is unable to do so, and the knowledge after the choice is a warning, so there must be another influence, other than those who are the ones who see them, and the one who sees them, and that is the one Disputed or fragmented, and the first is invalid, because it is necessary from the inhabitants of the effect, so it was not necessary for life to be not changed with death, and that the death does not change, and the faith is not in the life The animal is different members in the form, the adjective, the nature, and the private, and the effect of the influence required by the self, as well as our knowledge is that there is no one in the sake Another affects the path of ability and choice in the neighborhoods of these animals and in their deaths, and that is God, His Glory and Him, and it is a sign of strong and strong.Judges in his book as his saying: We have created the human being from a clay [the believers: 12] to the last, and his saying: We have created the human being in the human being We narrated it below Savlin [Al -Tin: 4, 5] and he said: He who created death and life [King: 2].The third question: for a saying that he says: He is the highest of death on life in verses from which he said: “How do you disbelieve in God, and you are God.” [28] And he said: He who created the death and life [the king: 2] and it was narrated from Abraham that he said in his second to God Almighty: He who dies and then revives [Al -Shua’ar: 81] The verse is the remembrance of life on death, when he said: My Lord who revives and dies [Al -Qar: 258]?.The answer: Because the intended is a sign of evidence if it is the invitation to God is the highest that the evidence must be in (P-22) the end of clarity, and there is no doubt that the wonders of the creation are the state of life more, and the knowledge of the human being is upon her, so there is no generosity, so there is no Remembrance.* * * As for his words, he said: He said: “I will revive and be illuminated, and I have angios: the first question: It is narrated that the premature of peace be upon him, when he was involved in that of the Hajj.Two people, and killed one of them, and the other was left, and he said: I also revive and illiterate.The truth of life and the truth of death on the face that we summarized in the recipient, and when he explained it to that face, he prohibited to pass on the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake The face of death, and the meaning in the sense of killing and leaving it, and distant in the great gathering to be in the Hama in terms of they do not know this destiny, and from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not know I know - something else, which is that Abraham ﷺ when he was brought in life and death from God.The denial said: Calling beyonds and death from God, as well The heavenly, or claiming the breasts of life and death from God Almighty by the mediation of the lands and the heavenly causes, as for the first: no way to it, and the second: Because the one of us is appreciated by life and death by the mediation of the captives of the reasons, then the consensus may lead to the living boy with the median of the lands and the heavens, and the hemorrhage, death.When we mentioned this question on this direction, Ibrahim, peace be upon him, answered that he said: He endowed that life and death have obtained from God, the highness of the communities For these communications and banking movements from a mastermind, then if the mastermind of those ownership is the Almighty, God is the Almighty, the life and the miracle of those who have been in the middle of these Also from God Almighty, as for life and death, which is on the basis of human beings by the midst of the banks and the victory, it is not like that; Because there is no ability to be good at the ownerships, so the difference appeared.And if you know this, then say it: God comes with the sun from the outskirts, not another indication, but rather the perfection of the first evidence; Its meaning: that if the life and death are from God by the mediation of the wages of the orbits, the wages of the orbits of God were also life and death from God, and the righteousness of God is the authority of God By the mediation of the heavens and the arms, the reasons are not signed by its destiny, so it was proven that the life and the righteousness of the one who is the one who is on the authority That face, and that he does not reconcile it, for this is the one who believes in the way of the running of this view, not what is the one who is the one who is the one who knows the The case.The second question: The readers are collected on the drop of a thousand “I” in the connection in all the Qur’an, except what was narrated from a number of its proof when it is the same as the one who is the same Because the guarantee of the speaking is “that it is“ the prodigy and the noun, but the thousand is that it cares for the stand as the distraction is attached to its silence to the stand, and what is this It falls on the connection, so this is a thousand, it falls at the connection; Because what is connected to him is his position, not to see that the thunder of the connection if the word in which the word is connected to it with something that has fallen and has not been proven; Because what is connected to it is connected to it to the region, after the prodigy, then the prodigy is not proven, so the thousand in “I” and the distraction that is in the stance is the same It is obligatory to thwart the gossip at the connection.“ More and more offenders, that Abraham, peace be upon him, when he saw that we have seen that semi -suspicion of that to that to another indication, and he explained from him, so he said: So he said: From the outskirts, he came with it from the Moroccan, so he claimed that the resignation from an indication to another indication was made clear from it.If it was said: Niastan said: Let your Lord bring it from the Maghreb?.We said: The answer is from two faces: one of them: that this pilgrimage was with Ibrahim after his meeting in the fire and his exit from it, so he knew that the one who is forbidden is that The great fire is from the burning, it is estimated that it comes to the sun from the Moroccan.The second: that God favored him and forgot him, this similarity is a victory for his Prophet, peace be upon him.And the second way, which the investigators said: This was what was transferred from a sign to another indication, but the evidence is one in the two sides, and it is that we see no life.On its events, it is not necessary for one who is one another who will take over its events, which is God, Glory be to Him, then we say: We see the sides of things that are not able to create the creation of the creation of the creation of it.Blution, death, and the clouds, the throat, and the lightning, and among them are the wives of the orbits, and the crocodiles, and the inferred is not permissible for him to move from an indication to another indication, but it is not possible, but it is a male, but it is not.An example, so he may move from that example to another example, so what Ibrahim did from the chapter on what is indicative is one, except that the resignation falls from the clarification of it The chapter on what is signed from a sign Another, and this face is better than the first and the words of the people of investigations from it, and the forms of them are from the faces: the first forms: that the owner of the suspicion, if it is the same, if it is the same.The suspicion is in the original, and it is necessary for the right to the answer to mention the answer immediately as a removal of that confusion and ignorance of the minds, so when he was stabbed by the angel, the one who stabbed the angel.In the first example, with that suspicion, the preoccupation with the removal of that suspicion and a lost obligatory duty, so how can the infallible be left to leave that duty?.And the second forms: that when the one who is invalidated is the question, then if the rightful one leaves the first words and transmitted to other words, it was delusional that his first words were weak, and he was a weakness, and he was a weak.Weakness, and that he is the one who has known his weakness and his being, and that he was a scholar with his weakness, so he warned him, and this is a person who is obligatory It is not permissible.And the third forms: that if it is improved by the resignation from an indication to a sign, or from example to example, but it must be the transmission to him, and it is clear to us, and it is clear to us, and it is clear.Likewise, because the generosity of life is not able to create it, and as for the hatred of the sacrifice of the bodies, the creation is able to it, and there is no distance in the mind in the mind The corpse is greater than the heavens, and that it is the one who is a moving for the heavens, and on this estimation: the domestication of life and the death of the existence of the one who is the one With the threshold of the sun on the existence of the chants, how can the informed prophet to move from the clear indicative of the appearance of the evidence that is not the hidden indication in the hidden evidence that is not Strong?.(P-24) The liqueum forms: that the connotation of life and death is based on the existence of the chain of transmission than the connotation of the sun of the sun, and that is because we see in the same human being and his attributes, And the change of the strong significance on the pilgrim to the subordinate influence, but the sun does not see in itself as a change, nor in its attributes it changes, nor in the approach of its movements, it is the same Blution and death are stronger, so the enemy was from it to the sun of sun, and it was transferred from the most evident strongest to the weak, and it is not permissible.Fifth forms: that we are not ashamed of the opposition of life and death, who are the ones who are glorified by God, with the killing and abuse, so how is it a person who believes in it The sun is to say: The sun is from the outskirts of me, so if you have a god, then say to him until he will be brought from the Maghreb, and when that is the time That is what they said: If this question was mentioned, it would have been necessary for the sun to come from the West, and it is known that the preoccupation By showing the corruption of his question in life and death, it is more difficult than the commitment to the sun’s knowledge of the West, so it is possible that the sun of sun is made The indication is the existence of the sunbuilding is the threshold of the sun from the Maghreb, and the sun of the sun is not a sign of the existence of the chanters, and the time of the second Lost, as his first indication became lost, and white, with what is indicative that was carried by Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to leave the answer to that question, the blessed question, and the ritual question, and the ritual of the time The resignation of a pioneer with a pledge that cannot be walking except with the commitment of the sun from the West, and the ability to come from the arrival of the sun of the sun His second indication is that the first is lost, and it is known that the commitment of this warning does not fit the least of the people with knowledge of the best of the minds and the knowledge of this The interpretation that has gathered the interpreters on it is weak, and the face that we mentioned is not directed from it from these problems, because we are not.Peace be upon him, with life and death, and the opponent is a question that does not follow the mind, which is that if you claim life and death, not by means, then you will not be found, then you will not be found, then you will be found to me They obtained them by the medium of the wages of the orbits, as it is its analogy or what is close to it, and it is good for it, so the Imraim, peace be upon him, answered that life and death, and if they are the same Those are the transgression of God Almighty, and that does not praise the universe of life and death from God Almighty, with the disagreement of creation, for there is no destiny for them to the one who does not The life and the death are shocked by them, and when we carried the words on this direction, there was nothing of the warnings mentioned, and God knows best.As for the saying of the Exalted: So I was the one who disbelieved, then the meaning is: He remained a sinner, and he does not find an article, nor for the question as an answer, and it is like his saying: Rather So they do not seek its response [Al -Anbiya: 40] The one said: There are three languages ​​in it: the man was faded, and it is a fool, and it is faded, and it is lost.I am suddenly, so I would have almost answered, that is: I confuse and silence.* * * Then he said: God does not guide the unjust people and his interpretation of our saying is unjust.For their oppression and their disbelief for the pilgrims and the right as the believer guides, for it is necessary in the infidel to be miraculous and cut.And I say: This is weak; Because his saying does not guide them to the pilgrims, but it is correct where the pilgrims are inburious or pilgrims on the infidels, so how is it true that it is said: God is not He guides him?The judge said: It is that he wants that he does not guide them to the rituals of the roll from where they are at unbelievers and darkness, they clogged themselves with themselves.And I say: This is also weak, because those increases if they are in their right to be reasonable for a mind, and it is not true that it is said: He is not the same as he does not guide them, as he does not say, as he does not.The two people are not combined between existence and numbers.Al -Qadi said: And from it that he is up to him, he does not guide them to the reward in the hereafter and does not guide them to paradise.And I say: This is also weak, because the reminder is the matter of the recipient and the acquisition of the known and the paradise is not mentioned, so it is the same as the one who says: The righteous in the context of the verse is to say: It is up to the one who indicated that the evidence had been reached in the back and the argument until where the vigor became like a wickedness, when it is heard, for the sake of his hearing He is appreciated for him, and this is not the same as the phenomenon, and this interpretation of this interpretation said: And if we have come to them, the angels, and the good They have everything before they would have believed, except that God would be blessed [Al -Anam: 111].* * * The second story: the intended is the proof of the re -saying, the words of the Almighty: or as it was a village and it is a fear of its veins.In the verse: the first question: the grammarians were disagreed with the entry of the kaf in his saying: Or as the one who mentioned three of the faces in it: the first: that the one who says: Hajj Abraham in the sense of “I did not see like a pilgrim,” and this verse is given to him, and the appreciation is: I saw as the one who is a pilgrim, or like the one who is the one who is the one who is a good one, or as This is a compassion in the sense, and it is the saying of the Kasayi and the virginity and my father Ali al -Farisi and the most gratitude of the grammarians, they said: And his counterpart from the Qur’an said: You knew they would say to God [the believers: 84-85] Then he said: Whoever is the seventh heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne will say to God, the one who is God, 87] In the sense; Because it is meaningful: Who are the heavens?It was said: to God, the poet said: ؎ Mu’awi, we are human beings, so we liked, so we looked at the wasting or the Hadida, so they were carried on the meaning and left the memorial.And the second saying, which is the choice of the fear: that the kaf is increased, and the estimation: you did not see the pilgrim who passed through a village.The third saying, which is the choice of the cold: that we are in the verse in the verse, and the estimation: did you not see to the one who Hajj Ibrahim, and I did not see who was like the one who passed through the village.(P-26) The second question: they were disagreed with the one who passed through the village, so a people said: He was a man who is a complaining of a complaint in the resurrection, and he is the saying of Mujahid and the most of those Al -Baqoun: He was a Muslim, then he said Qutdah and Akrama And the laughter and al -Saddi: He is Azir, and a gift from Ibn Abbas said: He is a trauma, then one of these who said: Throwing is the greenness of peace be upon him, and he is a man from Sibr.Peace be upon them, and he is the saying of Muhammad ibn Ishaq, and he said: Wahb ibn Mnabah: Antarctic.The pilgrimage of those who said: This passerby was an infidel, the first: the first: that God told him that he said: He revives this God after his death, and this is the words Death and that disbelief.If it was said: It is permissible that that was signed by it before the eloquence.We said: If it was not permissible from God, he would not be able to see his Messenger from him, as the boy would not be surprised by his doubt in the same way Recalling what was due to doubt in the capacity of God Almighty, but by the reason for the extermination of customs in that the example of that is the place that is the one who is the one who does not One of us is referring to a mountain, and he says: When will God turn him away, or sapphire, not that his intention is from him doubt in the capacity of God Almighty, but rather that he does not come to him The habits of customs, so we are here.The second face: They said: It is up to his right: when he was revealed to him, and this indicates that before that, it was not that clarification, and this is a weakness; Because the life is shown on the path of the testimony that he had before that, but that this is indicated by the path of the recipient, which was what he had.The third face: He said: I know that God is over all things, and this is indicated that this science is only for him in that time, and that he was an empty one, and that he was an empty, and that he was an empty one.The time, and this is also weak; Because that testimony is not doubted that it benefited the kind of affirmation, affection, and trumpets, and that destiny is of confirmation, but it is made in that time, and this is not the same.It was before that.The one who fits them: that this passerby was an infidel of its regularity with our argument in one behavior.It is also weak, because it was before it, even if it is a story of being promoted, but after the story of the question of Abraham, then it is obligatory to be a prophet from the head of Abraham.And the argument of those who said: He was a believer and was a prophet and a face: the first: that his saying: that this will revive this God after its death, it is on the authority of it, and it was a scholar, and it was a scholar.It is valid from it with life in the sentence; Because this thing is specialized in the receptivity of life, it is true that if the confession is obtained by the ability to be aware of the sentence, then whoever does not do the one who does It is not possible for this Specialization.The second pilgrimage: that his saying: How much you must have no one who said, and the previously mentioned is God Almighty, and the estimation became: God Almighty said: How much is the one who said: One day or some day, and God Almighty said: He said: Rather, you will be a year in a year, and it is confirmed that the saying of this saying is God, the Exalted, who said: Let us make it to you.Al-Qadir on making him a sign for people is God Almighty, then he said: And look at the bones, how do we spread it and then put it in flesh and not doubt that he said this (p-27) (P-27) It was proven that this verse is indicative of this many faces that he spoke with him, and it is known that this does not fit this infidel.If it was said: Perhaps he was sent to him a messenger or a king until he said to him this saying about God Almighty.We said: This is the meaning of these words indicating that he said these sayings with him is God Almighty, so the memorization of this phenomenon was disgraced to the metaphor of the other way.The third pilgrimage: that its return is alive and the meeting of food and the drink in their condition, and the return of the life in a vast time after it became a thief with its aspect of the view of the return of the parts of the parts Life is a great dignity and a generous honor, and that is not appropriate for the infidel.If it was said: Why is it not permissible to say: All these things are, but God Almighty entered it in the existence of the generosity of another human being who was a prophet in that time?.We said: This verse is not mentioned in this verse, and this story is not in this story, a state of poetry in the first place That is the prophet and his miracle of his miracle, so he left the remembrance of that messenger as an affliction because of the original abuse of words and it is not permissible.If it was said: If that person would have been either said: He claimed the prophecy before death and life or after them, and the first is false; Because sending the Prophet by God will be a reconciliation that will return to the nation, and that is not after the death, and if the prophecy is claimed after the life of the mourning, then the mourning is the one who is the one who has the grace, then it is the one after the sake The preacher, and that is not permissible.We said: The purification of the paranormal habits on the hand of those who know God that he will become a good Messenger with us, and on this way the question remains.The fourth pilgrimage: that he said in the right of this person: Let us make you a sign for people, and this memorization is used in the right of the prophets and the messenger, he said: For the two scientists [the Prophet: 91], then this was a promise from God, the Almighty, that he made him a prophet, and also this is this words [if] did not indicate that the prophecy is not.The great supervision, and that is not appropriate for those who died on the infidels and on doubt in the ability of God Almighty.So It was said: Why is it not permissible for what is meant by making him a verse is that those who know him from the people are a complete young man if they witnessed him after a hundred years on his youth and they have been broken or bored With the news that he had died for a long time and a young man has returned, it is true that it is said for the sake of that: it is a sign for people because they are considered to be with that, and they know that The Prophet of that time.The answer is from two vicinity: the first: that his saying: Let us make you a verse of news that he is the highest that makes him a sign, and this is the news, but it is after God, and God is not.It is made second, so it is obligatory to carry his saying: Let us make you a sign for people on an excessive matter of this life, and you carry it on this soul.And the second: that the face of the assignment is that it is said: and let us make you a sign for people that indicates the great supervision, and that is not worthy of those who died on the one who dies.(P-28) The Fifth Hajj: What was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, in the causes of the revelation of the verse.Azir and he was one of their scholars, and he came to them to Babel, so he entered Azir on the day that village and descended under a tree while he was on the authority of it, so he was in the past, so he said: One of that was a fan of that and said: I will revive this God after its death, not on the way of doubt in the ability, but rather on the way of the repetition, and it was the same, and the rest is, So we took from the jaws of figs and grapes, and he drank from the juice of grapes and slept, so God Almighty died in his dreams for a hundred years and he is young, then he blinded him to his death, and the one who is also, and the one who is also.May God bless him after the hundred and I would like to heaven: O Azir, how much did you pass after the death?He said: (One day), then he visited the sun, and he said: Or some day, and God Almighty said: Rather Their food, so look, and if the grapes and grapes are as they witnessed, then he said: And look at your life, so look, then if it is bones with a white, it has been dispersed, and it has been separated, and the bones were dispersed.The ballerina is that I make a spirit in you, so the parts of the bones join each other to one, and then the adhesion of every member with what the ribs fulfilled to the ribs and the arm, to the one who came to the ribs and the arm Its place, then the nerve and the veins, then the meat of the flesh was alerted to it, then the skin was simplified by it, then the feeling was removed from the skin, then it is the soul, then it is the soul, then it is the soul, then it is.He is a murder of mosques, and he said: He knows that God is on everything capable, and then he entered the house of the sacred, and the people said: Babel, and he was murdered by the house of the sanctuary.Whoever reads the mourning and was in them, Azir, and the people did not know that he reads the teeth, so when he came to them after a hundred years, he renewed them for the sake It was not exaggerated from it, and the mortar had been buried in a position, and it was brought out, and it was unaware of what it was in its money, so it was not in a letter, so they said: This is a popular novel in what is among the people, and that indicates that this passed was a prophet.The third question: they disagreed with that village, and he said, and a gift, and the honor, and the rabida: the house of the sanctuary, and Ibn Zaid said: It is the village Beware of death.As for the saying of the Almighty: It is a fear of its veins.ﷺ If he finds a luxurious, “meaning: He gave him what is between him and his two sides, and his stomach and his taking.The Persians were looked at what is between his strength.Then it is said to the house if he sighs: Awater because he threatened him to leave from his family, and so: The stars were lost and I was tired if they were broken, and they did not go away.The throne is the stood of the house, the elderly vehicles, and the watering of the wood is said: the throne of the man is throne and the throne if it is
