The Quranic researcher is that he is the Almighty, this story is the Almighty saying: that there is a lesson for those who fear, and the meaning is that when we are from the matter of Moses and the people of Moses, and the one who is a matter With the branch of the treasury, and the abuse of Moses from the high and the victory, a lesson for those who fear, and that is that the resurrection of God is called, and the deny With him what he descended with a virgin, and knowing that God Almighty will support His Prophet and His messengers, so be considered the pensing of the lies of the lies of God, what is it In the meaning of the punishment, you will have their punishment for punishment.Then know that he was exalted when this story was sealed, he returned to the address of my resurrection, so he said: You are more creative as the mother of the sky, in which there is a question: This is the one who is the first: the first: that it is a reference to my resurrection.The human being is on his younger (P-41) and its weakness, if it is added to the creation of the heavens on its greatness and the greatness of its conditions is easy, so it is clear that the creation of the sky is the greatest of you The return of the return is that it will be an estimated to God, so how do they deny that?And his counterpart is his saying: The first person who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the same as them [Yass: 81] and say it: to create the heavens and the one who created the elderly [Ghaffir: 57] The meaning is your creation after the death is more severe or created the sky, that is, with you, and in your estimation, then both of the two things are the same.The second: that the intended one of this reciprocate is that they are created, and this saying is weak for two ways: one of them: that whoever denies the same as the one who denies the same He denied it in the sky.And secondly: that the first of the surah was in the Bayan al -Hash al -Hashara and Al -Jasher, so he carried this speech on him.The second question: Al -Kisae, Al -Farah, and Al -Zajaj said: This speech was made when he said: The mother of the heavens, then the Almighty saying: (Bannah) Standing on his saying: (her son) said: Because it is from the heavens, and the ability: the mother of the sky that was built, then he deleted the one who said: The man came to you, a sane person, that is, the man who came to you, if it is proven that this is permissible in the language, then he says: The evidence is that he said: (his son) is a prayer for what he did.A link was a row, so he said: (Banna) is a row, then his saying: Raise her thickness is a liquid Establishing the emotion between them, as he said: He was covered with her night, and when he was not like that, he taught him that he said: (his son) is a link to the sky, then he said: The remembrance of his class, and the individual, to take over his saying that if his saying: (her son) was a prayer for the sky, then the righteousness of the name is: It requires a sky that God built, and that is false.The third question: which indicates that he is the heavens who built the sky with faces: one of it: that the sky is a body, and every body is an event; Because the body, even if it was eternal, was in the eternal, either that it is subversive or inhabited, and the sect is invalid, so the saying is the formation of the body is false.As for the limitation, it is that it is either to be stable, where it is, and it will be hungry, or it is not stable, where it is, and it is a fierce, but we say that it is that it is.It is moving, because what is the movement of the movement requires the precedence over, and what is the eternal thing is to contradict the precedent.Be hungry; Because the tranquility and a clear description, which is possible to disappear, is all possible to disappear to the deceased the actor, and everything that was like that is an event, so everything It is forbidden to be eternal, but we said that the silence and a clear description, because it changes as the body of the body, moving it in its way, as it is, with the sake And that it will be a confidential matter, so if the confirmation is the silence, then the intended, and if the identification is the movement, it is also necessary for the knocking to be the confirmation; Because the movement is alarm about the fact that it was in the place, and there is a dormant for the arrival in the place, after it was in it with the eyes of it, so it is the same It is not in what is in the way, but rather in the way, and it is not possible, and this is a disgraceful and external description of what is, and if it is if it is, then then it is so, then it is so Witness in one of the two pictures, it must be like that in another image, but rather we said that the sky is the permissibility of the disappearance, because it is if it was (P-42), it was not the same.His demise, so it was necessary for the sky not to move, but we have now seen it moving, so we knew that it was if it was dwelle The silence when it was possible for itself, it is limited to the deceased the actor because it was not possible for its own, so it must have a influence, and that is not the influence, and there is no effect that is not possible.Because that is the obligatory, if it is obligatory, and it is rich in its affirmation of that reason for a condition that is necessary for the time of that effect, so it was necessary for it to be not.And in a way that is in his positive affirmation of that reasoned to a condition and a duty of itself, it is necessary for the persistence of the cause and the pods of the condition, but if it is the obligatory, or the obligatory, or the obligatory The condition is not obligatory For itself, the words were like words in the first, so it is obligatory to be seen, and it is referred or ended to a obligatory and obligatory for itself, and to the condition and the obligation of itself, and the time of the first It was proven that that influential must be a fierce active act, so all of the cousins ​​are a false act, and everything that was like that is an event; Because the choice is to do the midst of the integrity, and the intention to form the being and the crops of the one who is referred to, so it is proven that every silence is that it is an event, so it is an event, so it is an event, so it is an event, so it is an event The body is in the eternal, neither hesmerly nor heavy, then it is not necessary in the eternal, then it is an update, and if it is an update, he is in the same way, and in the installation of the parts of it, the part of it, and the reward of it.She fixed the mind that the sky is God Almighty.The second pilgrimage: everything is only obligatory, it is possible, and all possible events, and every hadith has a subordination, but we said: everything is only for us, because we are the one who is possible, because we are.Two and those who are in their own ones, they are not bought in the existence and our absence with the awareness.Permanent to his part, and his part other than him, every crumb, so it is a lack of it, and all of its place It is possible with the same, this is a successor, then the words are transferred to the part of you, if they were and they are obligatory, every one of the parts of the parts was compound and the ritual of the The lack of them was the first of the existence, so it was proven that what is possible is possible, and all possible, it has a influencing, and everything that has been stirred to the influence; Because the interference to the influenced cannot be achieved in the state of survival to find the finding of the found, then it is imperative that it be either the case of the seeds or the state of the numbers, It is necessary, so you have proven that what was only an event is an event, and every hadith must have hadiths, so the sky must have.The third pilgrimage: the wilderness of the mind is witnessing that the generosity of the sky is not able to be more than what is now in the amount Exclusive, so he dispersed this fate with the fate without the uniforms and the decrease, and it must be with specialization, so it was proven that it is necessary for the heaven to be from that, then it is not.That it is said that he has created something and gave it a capacity that can be the creature with that destiny from the creation of the bodies, so the heaven is the heavens and its builder is that of that?The answer: Among the scholars who said: The one who knows the mind is that the heavens must be made, and that it is necessary to give the last matter to the end, and the God is the same And he is God, His Glory and Him.In this verse: (its son) indicates that the sky is God, not others, and among them who said: Rather, the mind is indicated by his heroes; Because when you have proven that everything that has been updated is the case that it is a restriction, not a duty, and who was able to do it, but it was true that it is true for it, for it is a place that is with it You raised the rest of the juice or the abstinence, and they refer the fate, and if (P-43) is what is for the sake of it, it is true in some that it will be in the place of it The possibilities, and it must be obtained in all the possibilities that are valid for God Almighty, and if this is proven that and the proportions of his estate to all of them, the one who is over the authority is upon the authority.Everyone, and if it is proven that God is able to be able to be able, and if we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do some of the places, it would be necessary to fall from one of the one who is one of the one who is one of you Reasonable; Because it is either to fall into one of them without the other, and it is referred, because they were independent of the opposite, and it is not that it is not with it, or it is from it, Because it takes advantage of each one of them from each one of them, so it is needed for them with them and richly from them with a referral, so you have noticed it that there is no In other words, except God Almighty, and this words are good, but it is a saying of those who do not prove in the existence of the effects of the same one, so this is the sentence of this door.And know that he was upset when he explained in the sky that it was built, indicating after that that he was about its sons, and that was explained by the entity from the faces of it: the first: the first: what is the one who is commented.Your poison.And know that the excess of the thing if it is taken from the top to the bottom of it was called deeply, and if it is taken from the bottom to the top, it is called your poison, so what is meant by raising the thickness of it They mentioned that what is between the land and between it is a publicity of a year of five, and [it] has been among the companions of the form of the amounts of the banks of the banks and the dimensions of each of them.Others said: Rather, the intended: Raise its poison from otherwise, and that is what is only valid from God Almighty.The second line: His Excellency said: (So it is it) and in it and Jahan: the first: the intention is the level The merciful was created from the recession [the king: 3] and those who say the first saying said: (So it is it) in general, so it is not permissible to specialize it with the pride in some of the people, so they said: The sky of the sky; Because if it was not a hatred, some of his sides were surfaced, and some are angles, and some are a line, and some of his parts were close to us, and some of us The realistic level is possible, so it must be a ka in that the truth will be the right to occur, and then they said: When it was proven that it is an update, it is a matter Any harm in religion arises from its place?.
