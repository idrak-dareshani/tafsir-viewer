The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of the Almighty: is that it is not possible for anyone to know that if we are pleased with the hardship in the power, then the meaning is that the human being is not.One of him is appreciated by him, and if we were pleased with the tendencies, the meaning was that of that on the heart, as if he says: He gave that the human being was in the nursery, and there is no One is appreciated by one?Then they disagreed, and each of them said: He will not be appreciated by his mission and his metaphors, as if he was a speech with those who denied the resurrection, and others said: The intention is that he will not be able to do.From him, it is strong on matters that are not defended from his want, and his saying: What is the reason for the negligence of denial.His exalted say: The people say that the money of Abbu Ubaydah said: It is necessary, a verb of the tilted, which is the many money, some of it is said to each other, and he said: A man is broken if he is a lot of destruction.Layth: money is not afraid of its sovereignty.We have mentioned this letters at his saying: They are on it with an beginning Many of what he agreed with as the people of the ignorant people were called a dignity, and they called it, my Exalted and Fakhir.* * * Then he said: What is the reason that no one has seen it in it in it.The second: Al -Kalbi said: It was a liar that was not spent, so God Almighty said: Do you think that God is the highest of what he saw from that, so he did or did not do it, and he did not, and he did not.He learned from him the disagreement of what he said.And know that he was upset when he narrated from that infidel, his saying: What is the reason that one of him will not be able to do the significance of the sign of his capacity, and he said: Two lips and guidance of the two people and the wonders of these members are mentioned in the books of the preacher.It was made like a high -level expense as a clear way to the minds as the high ways of the sins, and to this interpretation of the general gold of the one who is the one who is the one who is in general They are the way of goodness and evil, and on the authority of Abu Harirah that he is peace be upon him, he said: “They are the two, we find good and find evil, and we will not find the good And this verse is like a verse in: Is it come to the human being [man: 1] to his saying: So we made it a visionary hearing that we have guided him the path either as a thank you (P-167), or he said: 1] I have made money Who will hold me accountable for him?It was said: He who is able to create these members who are able to hold your accountable, and narrated from Ibn Abbas and Said bin Al -Masib, who is the one who said: Like the two strips of the life of the child and his livelihood, and God Almighty guided the little ritual until he put it, the lock said: And the interpretation is the first, then the decision is the same Whoever is able to create from the humiliating water a heart and a word, then he is on your hearts, what was created as a charity, and what the creature is hidden from the one who is a scholar, so what is the one who is the one who is the one who is a matter His clarity, and what is the argument in the infidelity of God from the back of his blessings, and what is the cause in the enhancement of God and the supporters of his religion with money, which is given to him, and he is the one who is given.Then he gave him and the exaltation of his worshipers on the virtuous faces in which the money is spent, and he defined this infidel that his spending was a pardon and a good one, so he said: And it contains questions: * * * The first question: the administering the income in the strict matter is said: Qahmah is dwarf, and the preservation of the immersion, and the burning of the burden, if it is obligatory The bones and the punishment are a way in the mountain and the nakedness, the gathering is the punishment and the punishment, then the interpreters mentioned in the obstacle, here are our faces: the first: that it is in the hereafter and said: Hell, and the dog said: It is a punishment between paradise and fire, and Ibn Omar said: It is a mountain of al -Zella in my face and said Mujahid and the laughter: It is the path that is struck by the hell, and it is the same The obstacle of paradise and fire, the one said: This is an interpretation in which there is a view that it is known that [Bani] is this human being and others, and they did not accept the obstacle The verse is a clarification of the clarifications, and it is indicated that when he said: I do not realize what the obstacle is, then he made it easy to dismantle the neck and with food.The second face: In the interpretation of the obstacle is that the remembrance of the obstacle is the example of God that God has harvested for the soul of the soul and the Satan in the ruins of righteousness, and it is the saying of the good God is severe, and it is the manifestation of the human soul, his passion, and his enemy from the devils of humanity and heaven, and I say this interpretation is the truth because the human being wants to rise from the world of the world Divine, and there is no doubt that between it and among them are high -end hinders without the thunderous thunderbolts, and its equivalent is difficult and the ritualism to it is severe.The second question: that in the verse is a problem, which is that there is no “neither” within the past, except for a condemnation, it says: Neither my longing nor me, he said: “No,” The verse is what the recession came, so what is the reason for it?It is answered from his face Because the meaning of the obstacle is not stated, then it is not a nickname, nor do I feed the poor, do not you see that he was pleased to imitate the obstacle with that, and say it: In the sense of the obstacle, nor safe.The second: Abu Ali al -Farisi said: The meaning of the obstacle is not stated, and it did not take it.She was deceived in a position like a charity, nor prayed, so he was repeatedly “and did not” The third question: Al -Qafal said: His saying: So do not proceed to the punishment, that is, if his money agreed in it in which he was implemented?As for the rest, they have gone on to the appearance of his appearance, which is the news that he did not preserve the obstacle.(P-168)
