The Quranic researcher (P-70) [Surah Al-Fitr] The ninetic of the nine verse is the same as the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.The graves were known as a soul that was presented and delayed ï·½ If the sky is breaking up, and if the makers are affected, and if the seas was died, and if the grave was found.The same is what was presented and delayed, know that what is meant is that if these things that are the things are the arms of the hour, then there is the good and spread, and in the interpretation of these.The first: In the interpretation of every one of these things that are the ends of the hour and are four; Two of them are attached to the louds, and the two others are attached to the signs.The sky is shrouded with the dignity [Al -Furqan: 25], if the sky is created [the split: 1], then if the sky was breathed, then it was a response like the delicacy [Al -Rahman: 37], and the heavens were opened, then the heavens are [19] And the sky is breaking with it [Al -Muzammil: 18] Al -Khalil said: And this did not come on the verb, but rather it is like their saying: breeders and a menstruating woman, and if he was on the verb, then he said: The sky was breaking up, while the second, which is his saying: If the makers are affected, the meaning is back; Because when the heavens are in the abound of the heavens, the cries must be stressed on the ground.And know that we mentioned in some of the advanced surahs that the philosophy is denying that the kneeling and the healing of the orbits, and our evidence is that it is possible that the bodies are in the place of it.He bodies, so he must be correct on each one of them, which is correct on the other.It is partner between the two divisions, for the lords and the signs are shared in that they are bodies, but we said: Whenever it was like that, it must be correct on the authority, what is true of the heights, what is correct for the sake of the heights.Because the similarities are one of the ruling, when a ruling is valid for one of them, it is necessary that (P-71) is correct on the rest, and the two signs are: and one of them is: It was fragmented in it, in which it is one of them: one of the sailors is executed in some of the pilgrims, which God has made with a stir That is the barrier to slip and crack the earth.And the second: that the water of the seas is now a group, then if it is devoid of separation, its water is gone.And the third: Al -Hassan said: I was deceived by any dress.He knew that on the three faces, it is intended that the seas changes from its original images and described it, and it is as it was mentioned that it is the one who is in the land of the authority of it.The earth changes the same land [Ibrahim: 48] and the mountains are changed from its class in its saying: Say it is sorry for my Lord, and he will warn it with a cliff.[106] And its booster: each of them read: (They do not want) [Rahman: 20] because prostitution and immorality are brothers.As for the second: his saying: And if the graves are found, then I know that it was stuffed and it was in a single meaning, and they are raised from the mission and the search with the sake It was raised, and the bottom of it is shed at the top and its inner appearance, then here and Jahan: One of them: that the graves are scattered that it comes out of what is in the mud.Its weights [earthquake: 2].The second: that it finds the excess of what is in its stomach from gold and silver, and that is because it is one of the ends of the hour to remove the earth, so that it is its heart from its gold and its sake The muti is the first, and the first is close; Because the connotation of graves over the first.The second place is in the use of this prohibition.He knew that what is meant by these verses is that the world and the annihilation of the world, the deduction of the clouds, the sky, the sky is like a stance, and the land is like building, and whoever wants to repel a house, then it is a house.By making the fall, and that is his saying: If the sky is breaking up, then it is obligatory from the heavens of the heavens, the cries are excited, and that is his saying: and if he said: After the heavens and the heavens, it will be sacked on the face of the earth, and it is his saying: If the seas, then it is immortal, then it is an exalted one, and the last thing is the one who is the one who is the earth His saying: And if the graves are found, then it is a sign of the heart of the earth as a back of a decoration, and a stomach for a back.The third place: in the interpretation of its saying: I learned the same as what was presented and was delayed in it.The first: That what is meant by these things is the remembrance of the Day of Resurrection, then there are faces: one of them: It is the most correct that the one who is intended is from it the dirt from the disobedience, and the one who is in disobedience, One of this day is what was presented, and he did not limit it, and what was delayed, and he paused in it, because his saying: What was required is required and (and late) It requires action, leaving, shortening, and expulsion, then if he came to the cabares and delayed the good deed, then the fire was nurtured, and if the righteous deed was presented and the righteous deed, then the righteous deed, then the righteous deed, and the righteous deed, then the good deed, then the good deed, then the righteous deed, then the righteous deed, then the good deed, and the righteous deed, then the good deed, and the righteous deed, then the good deed, heaven.And the second: What was presented from the work that I entered into the existence and what it was delayed of a year that is based on it after the good or evil.And the third of it: Al -Dahhak said: What was presented from the exhibitors and what you delayed, whatever lost.And its booster: The father of a Muslim said: What was offered from the works at the beginning of its age and what was delayed in the last of its age, if it was said: In any position of the positions of the resurrection?We said: As for the talisman science, it will be obtained at the beginning of the time of al -Hashah, because the obedience sees the effects of happiness, and the disobedient sees the effects of the misery at the beginning of the matter.As for The science is detailed, but it is obtained by the readers of the books and the accountant.(P-72) The second indifference: that the intention is said: the resurrection of the resurrection, but at the appearance of the an hour, and the decay of the clogged, and when the work does not benefit from it, then it is not the work of the work.The soul of its faith was not safe from before or has earned it in its faith for the best [Al -Anam: 158], so what the human being did to that end is the first of it, because it is the first of his work, because it is the first of its work After that, and this saying was the lock.
