The researcher is the Almighty: The people who were chosen were among those who believed in laughing, and if they pass them, they will be overlooked, and if they turn to their people, then they will turn them down, then they will turn them These are the righteous, and what they sent to them, who are preserved, and the day of those who believe in the infidels, laugh at your opinions It was a chain of transmission when he described the dignity of the righteous in the hereafter, after that, the curator of the disbelievers with the world in the world in their mockery and the laughter of them The disbelievers will be transferred in the last, and the intended of it will be given to the believers and the strengthening of their hearts, and in which there are questions: the first question: it is mentioned in the question: The first: that what is meant is from his saying: Those who have chosen the partners of the entrusted, such as my father, ignorant, and the son of the son And in a way and other than the poor of the Muslims, and they are mocking them.The second: peace be upon him came in a blow from the Muslims, so the hypocrites were harnessed, and they laughed and flirted with, then they returned to their companions, so they said: So they laughed at it, and this verse was revealed before it was reached to the Messenger of God ﷺ.The second question: It is the same as four things from the domestic customs.So the first: Its saying: Those who were chosen were among those who believed in laughing, that is, they mocked them and their religion.And the second: Its saying: And if they pass by them, they will be overlooked, that is, they act from the thym, which is the sign of the eyelid and the eyebrow, and it is also in the meaning That is, what is wrong with it, and the meaning is that they refer to them with the eyes of mockery and defect them, and they say: Look at these ways, they are tired of their souls And they take themselves to themselves in demanding reward they cannot.And the third of it: His exalted say: And if they turn to their people, they flip up with the jaws, who are admired by what they are in the evil, disobedience, and the blessing of the religion, or the one who is in the religion, The Muslims are bad, a relative read in the narration of Hafs for him: “Fakahin” without a thousand in this position and alone, and in the pillar of the Qur’an: Flags with a thousand, and it was said: They are two languages, and it was said: Fawshah, meaning those who are busy, are busy with the infidels and the blessing of the religion.And its booster: His Excellency said: And if they saw them, they said that these are lost, that is, they are a misguidance in the blessing of the present, the present, because of the reward of the reward, and there is no reward, and there is no reward for it, It was narrated by the infidels.“ And they agree with what they make of the right or falsehood, and they are tired of what they believe in a misguidance, but rather they are commanded to pray for themselves.As for the saying of the Almighty: the day who believe in the infidels laugh at it, and two questions: the first question: the meaning is that in this day, the day is the day that is the day that is the day that is the day that is The believer saves you from the infidel, and in this way of this sacrifice, it is one: one of them: that the infidels were laughing at the believers in the world, because of what they are, and the one who is in it, The believers sacrifice you with the infidels because they are in the kinds of torment and the evacuation, and because they knew that they were in the world on the other They won the residing nomads and obtained the fierce tiredness, and they entered the paradise, so they were sitting on your opinions, they looked at them, how are they to be tormented They get in it, pray for the night and the bombing, and they curse each other.The second: Abu Salih said: It is said to the people of the fire while they were brought out and their doors opened to them, so if they see it, then they will be accepted, and they would like to want to see the believer.To them on your opinions, then if they end up to their doors, they closed without them, so that is the reason for the laugh.The second question: His saying: On your opinions, they look at the state of those who laugh, that is, they laugh at them, who look at them, and to what they are in the humiliation and the children.* * * Then the Almighty said: Is the disbelievers to the disbelievers of what they did to do, in the sense of the richest, that is, the best of God?It is praised by you and the righteous.Ubaidah: Do not inform Abu Hosan as a messenger ∗∗∗ So what you do not come to the reward and the first to carry this to the path of recklessness, as you say: 49] The meaning is as if it is the Almighty to say to the believers: Is the disbelievers of the disbelievers on their work, which was from his sentence, laughed at you, and you will make them happy, and you will make them happy, and you will be in your way, and you will be in your way.Righteous?So this is an increase in their pleasure, because it requires an increase in their greatness and the intimidation of their enemies, and the intended of them.And God knows.
