The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: If you divorced them before they touched them, and you have been satisfied with them, and we will describe what you have imposed, except that they are pardoned or pardon The marriage, and that you are relieved of piety, and do not forget the grace between you, that God is what you do with vision.It has a skilled, and she spoke in the divorced woman who is not the one who is made if it was imposed a skill.In the verse: the first question: the Shafi’i is going to be the one that the cell is not determined by the skill, and Abu Hanifa said: The correct cell is determined by the sky, and it means that They leave it with it, and there is no sense of sensitivity and no partner.The fasting of the imposition, the prayer of the incursion, and the absolute warning, whether it was imposed or a nose.The argument of Al -Shafi’i is that the divorce is before the politician, the description of the skill is required, and here we find the divorce before the politician, so the saying is obligatory.Bayan the first presenter: His Excellency said: If you divorced them before they touched them, and you have been supposed to them, and you will be satisfied with what you have done.It is not completely words, but it is necessary for another to be given to the words, so it is to be added: it is to describe what you have been fell asleep, or it is added: the reassurance of what is the case, and it is the same, And the second is a desirable for its wings: one of them: that the one who is attached to the thing is a word (if) the number of that thing is back, so if we had a prayer on the authority Coming; Because it is not exile before it, but if we had carried it on the stalls, we did the case of the relationship; Because he is exile before him.And the second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: you have imposed a satisfaction that requires that all the skill be obligated to him; Because when the adultery was obligated to say it, they were fulfilled by the contracts.Because the requirement of the duty of everyone is also required for the description, but it is needed for the description of the descriptions; Because when the one who is required to have the path of all was the back of all, then the descendants of some were in this denomination was the need for the Bayan, so it was (P-121).The first one to carry it on the bias of the garment.And the third of it: that the verse indicated by the path of giving every skill has been presented as his saying: It is not permissible for you to take from what you have come to: The verse on the descriptions of the half of its holders on the top of the half.And the one that is: that the masculine in the verse is the divorce before the politician, and the time of divorce is located before the politician, which is appropriate for the descriptions of the skillful, and it is not appropriate for something.Male is in The verse is what is appropriate for the stalls, not what suits the garment was the one who is the first, but we are excluded in these faces, because some of them said: The meaning of the verse is: The half of the description is devoted to the journey that does not indicate the descriptions of the other half, except from the evidence of the speech, and it is when Abi Hanifa is not a pilgrimage, so it is from this Pay this question.The second of the submission is that this is the one who finds the divorce before the politician, is that what is meant by the politician is either the right to touch the child, or it was made for the sake The divorce was found before it.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, his saying is up to the Almighty: If you want to redeem a husband, a pioneer, and one of them came as a hook, so do not take anything from him: Some of you to some [Al -Nasa: 21] The divorce is before the cell, and whoever claims to be specialized is that we have the two.The second: that God Almighty forbade taking the skillful and the cause of the cause of the hypnotics, which is the cell, and the hypothesis is derived from the hypothesis, and it is the empty place, so we know that the cell is determined.And our answer to that is that the verse that they are in general, and the verse that we hold in particular, and the private are presented for the year.And God knows.The second question: Its saying: You have imposed a condition for them as a state of the verb that you divorced, and the estimation: You divorced them as if you did.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: except that they are forgiven in his two questions: the first question: but the noun did not fall from those who pardon They are pardoned by the action of women, so they are high in raising, position, and reward, and the noun is in pardon The noun is the mark of raising, so that the noun that is the guarantee of the collection of femininity has not been destroyed, as the wow, which is the guarantee of the gathering of the collection If the wow men who are the act of the verb in the pardon, are the one who is the guarantee of gathering, and God knows.The second question: the meaning: except that the divorced women are forgiven for their husbands, so they do not ask them for the description of the skillful, and the woman says: I did not see me, nor did you see it.How can I take anything from him.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Or he pardoned the one who does the contract of marriage, and he has two questions: the first question: in the verse, the first, the first: that it is the one who says: Peace be upon him, Saeed bin Al-Masib, and many companions and followers, and he is the saying of Abu Hanifa.(P-122) and the second saying: He is the guardian, and he is The saying of goodness, Mujahid and Al -Maqamah, which is the saying of the companions of Al -Shafi’i.The Hajj is the first saying: The first: that it is not for me to give the skill of his loyalty as a young man, whether it was or old, so it is not possible to carry this.The second: that the one who is the one is the contract of marriage, then if the contract is held; Because building the verb indicates the verb, such as eating and the peak, and the source is the contract, as is the eating and the peak, then from the knowledge that the one is the one who is the one who is the same The husband is not in the hand of the guardian.And the third: that his saying is up to him: the one who has the contract of marriage is based on his hand, the contract of a marriage that is fixed for him, not for others, as he said: Paradise is the shelter [the disputes: 40], meaning: the soul is forbidden from the fixed passion for it, not for others, the paradise was fixed for it, so it will be his goodness.Al -Rabaa: What was narrated from Jabir Bin Mutamam, that he married a woman, and he divorced her before he entered it, so he completes the righteous, and he said: The companions understood from the verse, the pardon, which is from the husband.The pilgrimage of those who said: What is meant is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is given to the husband, and that is a gift, and the gift is not called the first, and the first is called from the first.Wajoh: One of them: that the majority of them had to market the skillful to them when the marriage, then if he divorced it, he is worthy to ask for it to be described, then he will be asked, then he will ask for it.About it.And the second: he called him pardon on the way of problems.And the third of it: that pardon has been intended for the sacrifice.Something, and on this pardon the man to send all the rods on the face of the ease.The people who said that what is meant is the one who is the one who is the first question that the breasts of pardon from the husband on that face are only on the authority Related, and carry the divorced woman, the disagreement of the original, and they answered the second question that pardon is the one who is the innocent, and this is pardon in the truth The gift of the gift is how to be called pardon?And they answered the third question that if the forgiveness was the sacrifice, it was all those who facilitated a person something that is said: He pardoned him, and he is not known.The second pilgrimage to those who say that what is meant is the guardian: that the remembrance of the husband has been presented with his saying, Glory be to him, and if you divorced them from before What is meant by his saying: Or he pardoned the one who is the contract of marriage is the husband, he said: Or pardon, on the path of the addressee, so when he did not do that With the memorial The Maghreb, we know that what is meant is not the husband.And the first answered that the causes of the enemy from the discourse to the absence of the alerts in the sense for which the sake of the husband desires the forgiveness, and the meaning: except that it is pardoned or pardoned He loved her that the king of the contract of her marriage from the curtains, then there was no reason for it in the separation, but rather the husband who walked it up, so it was not a right that he did Her friendship.The third pilgrimage to those who say that he is the guardian: that the husband is not in his hands the bit of the contract of marriage; That is because before the marriage, the husband was foreigners about the woman, and there is no ability for him to leave in it with the face of the face After the marriage, the marriage has come, and there is no ability for it to find the existence, but rather a destiny to remove the marriage, and God (P-123) is the Most High, the one who has been in the way of the pardon The contract of the marriage was able to do, and when it was proven that the husband has no hand or a capacity for the contract of marriage, it is proven that it is not the intention of the husband, but the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the wilderness Its marriage, so what was meant by the verse was the one who is the one who is the husband, then those who say this saying answered about the evidence of those who said: What is meant is the husband.As for the first pilgrimage: the action may be added to the actor at the time of the pasture, and the last of the captivity is said: the sons of the Emir are a house, and it is a dinar, and the appearance is that Their concerns, and the knowledge of their reconciliation, to the sayings of the guardians, and the most promising that everything related to the matter of marriage is that the woman does not go into it, but it is in it, but rather it is the same.My guardian’s opinion, and on this estimation, the extent of the pardon of the guardian’s choice and his endeavor, for this reason I am adding forgiveness to the guardian.As for the second pilgrimage: it is their saying: the one who is the contract of marriage is not the contract of marriage.We greeted us that the contract is the contract, but that is the contract, but it was obtained and formed by the mediation of the contract, and the contract of marriage was in the hands of the guardian The marriage in the hands of the guardian is also by the medium of its sophistication from the argument of the contract and its effects.As for the third argument: it is his saying: What is meant is from the verse that is in the contract of marriage for itself, so his answer is that this possibility does not require him to be the same.Because if it is said: So that it is in his hand, the matter, the end, the raising, and the redundancy, then it is not intended for it that the one who is in his hand is something of his soul And it is forbidden, so it is so.* * * The second question: The advisor has to hold this verse in Bayan that it is permissible to marry only by the guardian; That is because the boys were gathered together What is meant by his saying: Or he pardoned the mother of the marriage of the marriage either the husband or the guardian, and his pregnancy is overlooked on the husband, when he showed us that the zoom has not The contract of marriage, so it is obligatory to carry it on the guardian.If this is proven, then he says: His saying: His hand is the contract of marriage.Because if it was said: He has the end of the matter and the forbidden, it is that it is in his hand, and it is not unlike it.The marriage is not in the same way, and if it is like that, it is necessary to be in the woman of the contract of marriage, and that is the one who is required.And God knows.* * * His Excellency said: And to be relieved of the piety in it in it: Cleeping that the male is origin, and the junior is a pious in the memorial and in the meaning, but in the memorial, you say: a person.Then you want to appear and say: a standard.The memorial is the most basic, and the feminine indicates that it is a branch on it, and in the sense, the blame for the male and the deficiency of the females, for this is the one who is the one.Remembrance and ritualism was the one who was overwhelmed.The second question: the position of "a" raising with the appetite, and the estimation: the pardon is close to piety, and the imam in the sense (to).The third question: the meaning of the verse: the forgiveness of some of you from some close to the fact of the meaning of piety, but the matter was like that for you: Well, and whoever is good, he deserves the reward, and whoever deserves the reward, he denied that reward without the punishment and removed it.The second: that this industrial calls it to leave (P-124) the darkness that is piety in the truth; Because he who has forgiven his right and has an offer that is close to his Lord, he was far from being oppressed by others to take what he does not have right.Then he said: Do not forget the best of you, and what is meant by the forbidden from the forgetfulness; Because that is not in the expansion, but what is meant by the leaving, so he said: Do not leave the best and the preference between you; That is because if a man marries the woman, then her heart was suspended with him, so if he divorced her before the politician, then it is a reason for his harm to him, and if he widens it, then the man is from it It has a skillful that the atmosphere benefited from it, so that it became a reason to harm it from it, so the exaggeration of each one of them was delegated to a verb that removes that of the abuse of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will come to the time Its heart is given that the skill is delivered to the college, and we will give the woman to the release of the skilled in the kidneys, then it is the Heavyness of the verse with what is done by He said: God is what you do.
