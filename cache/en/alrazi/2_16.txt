The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: Those who bought the delusion with the guidance, so when their merchants were profitable, and they were not guided, and he knew that the misguidance of the misfortune of it.If it was said, how did they buy the delusion with the guidance, and they were not guided by our saying that they were made to be able to do it as if in their hands, then if they left it and they are left to the lost With it, (p-66) and the misguidance is the wound and the exit of the intention and the lack of the deduction, so it is redeemed for the one who is right in religion, but his saying: So what is good for them They profit in their merchants, and there are two questions: The first question: How do you deny the loss to the merchant and it is for its companions?Answer: It is from the metaphorical chain of transmission, which is that the verb attributes something that is worn in the one who is in the right to him as the merchant was dressed in Al -Mashtari.The second question: He endowed that the purchase of misguidance with guidance was metaphor in the sense of the future.The answer: This is what strengthens the matter of the metaphor and improves it as the poet said: “When I saw the ease, the son of the son of Da’iya, and I loved it in his way, he gave it to me.With the ease, and the poetic poetry is in the wild, followed by the remembrance of the raising and the fabric, so this is what we are when he mentioned the grace of the purchase, followed by what he would make him Because their losses and a confusion of his truth, as for his saying: They were not guided, the meaning is that the one who is asked by merchants in their warships: And profit, and these were lost the two things; Because the head of their money is the empty mind of the obstacle, when they believed these misguidance The truth.Qatada said: They moved from the guidance to the delusion, from obedience to disobedience, and from the group to separation and from the security to fear, and from the Sunnah to the heresy.
