The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: that book has the books: the first question: for a saying that he says: the one who is referred to is here Jahin: The first: We do not surrender that the referred to him is present, and his leadership from his face The cow is a large fence, which is all that has come down with the owner of what is in the significance of the neutrality, the corruption of the evil, the prophecy of the prophecy, and the confirmation of the reference, so that it is: The light that came down before this surah, and some Qur’an may be called Quran, God Almighty said: And if the Qur’an is read, then they will be listened to him [204] We heard a wonderful Qur’an [Al -Jin: 1] and his saying: We heard a book that was revealed after Moses [Al -Ahqaf: 30] and they heard only the bone, and it was the one who was the one who was the one who was.And the second: He is the Almighty and his Messenger has promised him to send him a book that is not permitted by the survivors, and he is upon him, peace be upon him.And his saying supported him: We will give you a heavy saying [Al -Muzammal: 5] and this is in the Surah of the Mass.And the third of it: that it was a condemnation that addressed the children of Israel, because the cow is a civilian, and it is more ugly to the children He sends Muhammad ﷺ and descends on it as a book, so he said: That book, that is, the book that has informed the prophet who advanced that God Almighty will come to the authority of the Prophet.Ismael.And he paid it: It is up to the Qur’an that it is in the revelation of the strawberry with his saying: It is in the mother of the book to our religion [Al -Zakarf: 4] It is not forbidden to say the Almighty: that book to know that this revealed is that book that is stable in the edifice.Fifth: that the signal was signed by the “pain” after what was previously spoken to and passed, and the opponent in the ruling of the diligent.And its sixth: that when the messengers arrived to the messengers, he signed in the dimension, as you say to your friend - and you have given him something - he kept you.And the sake of it: The Qur’an, when he was a great ruling and a lot of sciences, is difficult to see the human power over it with its families - and the Qur’an, even if it is the one who is present to it But it is absent, looking at its secrets and entitlements - so he was done to refer to it as it is referred to the absent domesticated.The second place: We greeted us that the referred to him is present, but we do not surrender that the memorization of “that” is not referred to except to the distant, with that it is that, and this is a warrant, and this is a sign.” Because it is a letter For the reference, the Almighty said: Who is the one who lends to God a good loan [the cow: 245] and the meaning of “Ha” is alerted it, so if the thing is close to it, then it is a sign of it.The addressee of what I have indicated to him is that he is present for you, where you see it, and the sufficiency may enter the “with the addressee” to the address In the way of the alert to delay the referred to him, this indicates that the memorization of that does not benefit the distance in the origin of the place For the readers that we mentioned, then it is like the tab, then it is discreet in the wedding of the mare, and if it is in the origin of the place, it is a source of all that is the same.So we say: We carry it here on the requirement of the linguistic position, not on the requirement of the norm, and then the distance is not beneficial; For the sake of this approach, every one of the two people is held in the place of the other.Remembering [p.49] and said: And they have baccalaureates of the part of the dust.So God took him the last and the first is that there is a lesson for those who fear [the disputes: 25, 26] and he said: And we have written in the zipper after the remembrance that the land is the one who has the righteousness [Al -Anbiya: 105] Then he said: In this, by informing the worshipers of the two worshipers [Al -Anbiya: 106] and he said: We said, "We will leave him with some of them, so that God will give God: God is the dead, and he said: And what is with your right, O Yamousi [Taha: 17], that is, what is this with your right and God knows.The second question: for a saying to say: Why did he mention the name and referred to him, feminine, which is the surah?Answer: We do not recognize that the referred to it is feminine; Because the feminine is either the name or the name, and the first is invalid, because the name is that one of the Qur’an and it is not a feminine, and the name is (the pain), which is the (pain) The name has another name, which is the surah, which is feminine, but the previously mentioned is the name that is not feminine and is (the pain), not the feminine and it is the surah.* * * The third question: I know that the names of the Qur’an are many: one of them: the book, and it is a source like standing and fasting, and it was said: a verb in the sense of the same And they agreed that what is meant by the Qur’an said: A book that we descended to you [p.29] and the book came in the Qur’an on the faces of it Fasting [Al -Baqarah: 182) The prayer was on the believers as a book that is standing [Al -Nasa: 103].And the second: the pilgrimage and the proof, so come to write you if you are true [Al -Saffat: 157] That is, your proof.And the third of it: the larger and what we have been in a village except for it and it has a knowledgeable book [Al -Hijar: 4], that is, the term.And its elevation: in the sense of the offices of the master of his servant and those who seek the book from what has owned your faith [Al -Nur: 33] and this source is a verb with the meaning The argument, the opponent, and the fighting, and the books of the books from the books of the thing if they were collected, and the kings were called for its meeting, so the book is called a book because it is like a book that it is like a book like it Young people, or because he gathered in it all the sciences, or because God is the Almighty in which the crown is obligatory for creation.And the second: The Qur’an say that when humanity and gathering gathered to come to the same as this Qur’an [Al -Asra: 88] We made it a Quran in Arabic [Al -Zukhruf: 3] The Qur’an [Al-Baqarah: 185].Like losing and losing one, and the evidence is upon him, his saying: If we read it, then follow its Qur’an [Resurrection: 18] that is, his recitation, that is, if we recite it, then you will follow it.The second, which is the saying of Qutdah: that it is a source of the saying: I read the water in the basis if I gathered it.So the words, and the words gathered, then the verses, and the verses gathered, and they became a light, and the light gathered a Qur’an, then he gathered in it.It is the one that has been derived from the memorization of the Qur’an either from recitation or from the group.And the third of it: the differences are the one that has descended the differences on its servant [the differences: 1] and the evidence of guidance and the differences [the cow: 185] and they were dispersed in the interpretation of it.Thus, because his descent was dispersed, and he descended it in a twenty -year -old, and his evidence said his Almighty saying: and a Qur’an that separated him to read it to the people of the people Design [Al -Asra: 106] and the book of the books descended a single sentence, and the judgment is in it in which we mentioned it in the wall of the difference in the saying of the Almighty: and he said: The Qur’an has a single sentence, as well as that we will be proven by your hearts [Faraqan: 32] and it was said: It is called that because it is separated from the truth and the righteous, The court and the interpreter, and it was said: The differences are the survivor, and it is the saying of Ekrama and al -Saddi, and that is because creation is in the darkness of the misguidance, so the Qur’an, and they found the survivor, The interpreters said: And when we came to the book and the difference, you may be guided [Al -Qar: 53].And its elevation: the remembrance, the memory, and the remembrance.It is a remembrance for you and your people [Al -Zakhrf: 44] In it and Jahan: One of them: It is a remembrance of God, the Almighty, and his servants mentioned them, so he defined them with his clogs and his people.The second: It is a remembrance, honor, and pride for those who believe in it, and that it is an honor for Muhammad ﷺ, and his nation, and the remembrance is his saying: And it is for the sake of God: As for the remembrance, it was said by the Exalted: The remembrance is the remembrance of the believers [Dhiyatiyat: 55].Fifth: the download, and it is to download the Lord of the two worlds, with which the faithful spirit [Al-Shua’ar: 192-193].And its sixth: The hadith of God has revealed the best of the hadith as a book [Al -Zamer: 23] called it a hadith; Because his prayer for you is a hadith, and because he likened him to what he is speaking to him, then God has addressed him with the costs.And the sequence of it: the preaching, O people, you have come to your Lord.Muhammad ﷺ, how does the preacher fall into it.And the eighth: the judgment, the wisdom, the wise, and the rule, but the judgment is saying it: and we have revealed it to the ruling: 37].[Moon: 5] And remember what is recited in your homes from the verses of God and wisdom [Al -Ahzab: 34].A book whose verses were judged [Hood: 1] and they were dispersed in the sense of wisdom, so the Khalil said: It is taken from the rulings and commitment, and the historian said: He is taken from the ruling of the ruling; Because it plays the bear, and the wisdom is prevented from fooling.And the ninth: healing and we remove from the Qur’an what is healing and mercy for the believers [Al -Israa: 82] and its saying: Healing for what is in the breasts [Yunus: 57] Diseases.The second: It is a healing of the disease (P-15) of the disbelief, because it is the highest and described the disbelief and the suspicion of the disease, so he said: In their hearts, a disease [the cow: 10] The heart, so correct and describe it as a healing.And her adore: Al -Huda, and Al -Dhi: As for the guidance, he said it: Haddah for the righteous [Al -Qar: 2] Haddah for people [Al -Qar: 185] [Yunus: 57].Haddi is ten: the straight path: Ibn Abbas said in his interpretation: It is the Qur’an, and he said: And that this is a righteous argument, so follow it [Al -Anam: 153].And the second is ten: the rope: and they are silent about the rope of God all [Al -Amran: 103] in interpretation: it is the Qur’an, but it is called by it because the one is in it.He is saved by the last of the last and the world, as the one who is holding the rope escapes from the place of fine A grace of those who have been in which he is desperate, “because he is disobeying people from sins.The third is the tenth: the mercy and we remove from the Qur’an what is healing and mercy for the believers [Al -Asra: 82] and any mercy, according to the shame from the ignorance.The four -year -old: The Spirit, and we have forgotten us from our command [Al -Shura: 52].Jabriel was called the Spirit, so we sent us to our soul [Maryam: 17] and Jesus with the Spirit, so that it is met to Mary and a spirit from it [Al -Nasa: 171].The fifteenth: The stories are the most improved of the stories [Yusuf: 3] He called it because it is obligatory to follow it and said to his sister: Its impact; Or because the Qur’an follows the stories of the advanced, and it is the Almighty saying: This is the right of the truth [Al -Amran: 62].The sixth is the tenth: the Bayan, the teeth, and the evidence: as for the Bayan, its saying: This is the Bian for the people [Al -Amran: 138] and the two sayings, so it is his saying: and we have come to us.Something [bee: 89].The seven is ten: The vision of this is a vision of your Lord [Al -Arif: 203], meaning that it is evidence that the truth insists on it to the sight that sees the way of salvation.Twenty-eighth: The chapter is a chapter, and what is slippery [Al-Tariq: 13-14] and they differed in it, so it was said by the judiciary, because the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the right It was said that he separated among people on the day of resurrection, so he guides a people to paradise and is one of the others to the fire, so whoever made him his imam in the world, he led him to the garden, and he will make him.(P-16) The ninth: the stars, so I do not divide the case of the stars [Al-Waqi'a: 75] and the stars if it is fed [Al-Najam: 1] because it is a result.The twenty: the second: the second of it is the glimmer of those who fear their Lord [Al -Zamer: 23] it was said that he was praised in it the stories and the news.The twentieth: the grace: As for the blessing of your Lord, he spoke [Al -Duha: 11] Ibn Abbas said that the Qur’an means.The second and the twenty: the proof has a proof of your Lord [the women: 174] and how it is not a proof, and the eloquence has been rewarded for the same.The third and the twenty: the good and the vow, and in this name, the partner was located between it and the Prophet, the Almighty said in the attribute of the messenge The characteristic of Muhammad ﷺ: We sent you a witness, a missionary, and a vow [Al -Fath: 8] and he said in the character of the Qur’an in the ham of the prostration, as good and vowed, so the most of them is more than one [4] It means preaching the paradise of those who obeyed and with the fire a warning to those who disobeyed, and from here we remember the blessed names between God Almighty and between the Qur’an.Funny and ten To warn a severe misery [Al -Kahf: 2] and the debt is also valuable for that valuable religion [Al -Tawibah: 36] And God is the Glory of God, God is God, but He is the one who is alive.It was called a valid because it is based on the same in the Bayan and the benefit.The fifteenth: the one who is immortalized, and we descended to you the book with the truth, believing that it is between the book from the book and is immersed upon it [Al -Maaidah: 48] and he is from the one who is from the one who is from the one who is from the mother Whoever holds the Qur’an is the security of the war in the world and the hereafter, and the Lord who is immortalized, the descending book on the faithful prophet for the sake of the people of God said: Likewise, we have made you a nation and a simplicity to be a testimony on the people [Al -Baqara: 143].The sixth and the twenty: the guidance is that this Qur’an guides to the one who is the most people [Al -Asra: 9] and he said: He guides to the adult [Jinn: 2], and God Almighty is the guidance because he came in the news.The seven and the twenty: the light of God is the light of the heavens and the earth [Al -Nur: 35] and in the Qur’an and follow the light that was revealed with it [Al -Arif: 157] means the Qur’an from the Qur’an God is a light and a clear book [Al -Maaidah: 15] meaning Muhammad and his religion is called light, they want to warm the light of God with their mouths [Al -Safa: 8] God is his chest for Islam, so he is on the light of his Lord [Al -Zamer: 22] and the Tawarah was called light.The Gospel in which there is a guidance and a light [Al -Maaidah: 46] and the faith was called a light whose light sought between their hands [Al -Hadid: 12].The twenty -eighth: the truth: it was mentioned in the names “the martyr’s scholarship” and the Qur’an is a right, and it is the right of the juice [Al -Haqqah: 51], so God is true; Because he is against falsehood, and he will remove falsehood as he said: Rather, we are slaughtered with the right to falsehood, so he will be integrated, so if he is a majestic [the Prophet: 18], that is, a bright delicacy.(P-17) The ninth and ten: the dear, and your Lord is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful [the poets: 9].A messenger of yourself is dear to him and the nation is dear, and God is pride and his Messenger and the believers [the hypocrites: 8] Dear, dear nation, and for the dear meaning: one of them: the one who is the one, and the Qur’an like that; Because he is the one who has the most prominent and prevented those who wanted his exhibitions.The second: that it is not the same.Thirty: The generous is a Qur’an in a place in a place [Al -Waqi'a: 77] and know that it is the highness of the seven things in the generous of the generosity of the generosity of the generosity of God.The most of it, and the Qur’an with generosity, because it is not beneficial from a book of wisdom and science Carrm and a generous messenger came to them [smoke: 17] and he called the reward of the honors, and he preached it with forgiveness and a wage of generous [Yass: 11] and he called his throne as a generous, not God [Al -Nimel: 26] Because it is the homes of the mercy, and he called Jabriel Keimim that he said a generous Messenger [Al -Haqiya: 40] and it is meaning that he is a dear one, and he called a book To me is a generous book [Al -Nmal: 29] It is a generous book from a generous Lord with which a great king has revealed to a generous prophet for the sake of a generous nation, so if they do not Creary.The thirty -year -old: the great: the seven of the second and the great Qur’an [Al -Hijar: 87] and know that he was the highness of his soul, and he said: 255] And his throne is great, and he is the Lord of the Great Throne [Tawaba: 129] and his book is great and the great Qur’an [Al -Hijar: 87] and the day of the greatness of a great day People to the Lord of the two worlds [the woven: 5-6] and the treachery is great.[The Pen: 4] The science is great, and the best of God is great for you [Al -Nasa: 113] and the good of the women is great.With a great magic [Al -Araf: 116], the soul of the reward was called great, and God who believed and did the righteous from them forgive Great and great torment [Al -Amran: 176].Thirty -second: the blessed: This is a blessed remembrance [Al -Anbiya: 50] and God called upon him things.The blessing of the tree [Al -Qasas: 30] and the tree of the olive is called a blessed ritual from a shaky tree of adornment [the repentance: 35] for a lot of the benefits of it.Blessed [Maryam: 31] and the rain called a blessed and we descended from the sky with blessed water [s: 9] because of the benefits in it, and the night of the fate was called a blessing, we descended from it.3] The Qur’an is a blessed male that a blessed king has descended on a blessed night on a blessed prophet for a blessed nation.* * * The following question: In the Bayan, he said: The pain of his saying: That book, the owner of the scouts said: If you made the name of the wall in the righteousness: Beginning and that is a second beginner, the book has been informed and the sentence is the first beginner, and it is meaning that that is the complete book, as if what he has prepared from the books in the absence of it It is qualified to be a book (P-18) as it says: He is the man, that is, the whole in the college of the universal man, so that the men are in the men, and that the book is a description, and it is a description The book is the promise, and that the pain is a starting and deleted news, that is, this pain, and that book will be a second news, or by the fact that the book is a description, and its meaning is that A sentence, and that book is another sentence, and if the pain of the voice of the voice was made, that was a beginner, and the book was told by that, that is, that book, the book is the whole book, or the book, or the book, or the book, or the book, or the book, or the book, After it, or the initiative of the beginning, it means that the author of this forever means that book and read the servant of God, did you not download the book, not the one who is a good man.[2] This is an apparent.* * His Excellency said: There is no doubt in which there are two issues: the first question: the Lord is close to doubt, and there is an increase in it, as if he thought of a bad one, then he said: And among them is the saying of peace be upon him: Hope: We are waiting for the Lord of the Senate [Al -Tor: 30] and it is also used in the sense of what is disappeared in the heart of the causes of anger as the saying of the poet: The Siuva group is our saying: These two may refer to the meaning of doubt, because what is afraid of the Lord of the Sunnah is an inner Mitnqin, and the Almighty said: There is no doubt about what is meant by the exile, as he is a misfortune for the Lord, with the face of the faces, and there is no one in the face, and there is no one who is in the face of it, and there is no He is from God, nor in his miraculous.And if you said: What is meant is not a doubt in his being, a miracle of the properties, it was close to the affirmation of this statement of his saying: If you are in a bad thing [Al -Baqara: 23] We are asking: He has no one in it.The answer: What is meant is that he has reached the clarity to where he does not want to be suspended in it, and the matter is like that; Because the Arabs are with their manifestation in the eloquence to the end, they are rewarded for the opposition of the shortest surah from the Qur’an, and that is witnessing that this is the same It is permissible for a sane person to be suspended in it.The second question: Why did he say here: There is no doubt about it and in another position, in which there is no lapse [Al -Saffat: 47]?The answer: Because they offer the most important, the most important, and we are the most denying the Lord in the college from the book, and if you said: There is no doubt that there is no one who is there, there is no right.Here, as he intended in his saying: There is no ghost that prefers the wine of paradise on the wake of the world, because it does not seduce the minds as it seduces the wine of the world.The third question: From where does his saying indicate: there is no doubt about it Rye in the college?Answer: The father of Al -Shua’at reads, in which there is no doubt.And know that the famous reader requires the reaction of the Lord in the whole, and the evidence for it is that his saying: There is no doubt for the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Every individuality of the essence of what is, because if it has proven an individual (P-19), the analogy of the wiped out, the waters are proven, and that is contradicted by the negation of what the wiped God except God, “denial of all the gods, except God Almighty.As for our saying: “There is no doubt in it,“ by raising, it is an evaluation of our saying: “Rabb in it” and it benefits the confirmation of one individual, so that the negative is the same To achieve the contradiction.Standing on “in it”: the second question: standing on it is the famous, and on the authority of Nafaa and Asim that they stood on no doubt, and the positions must be of the position of the position, His saying: They said no And appreciation: (there is no doubt in which there is a guidance).Know that the first reader is first; Because on the first readings, the book itself is a guidance, and in the second, the book does not have this guidance, but it will be in it, and the first is the first for what is repeated in the Qur’an The Qur’an is light and guidance, and God knows.* * * This is a guidance for the righteous, the words of His Excellency: This is a guidance for those who fear in it.Overing, and others said: Hoda is the guidance and knowledge.And that indicates the validity of the first saying and the corruption of the second and third saying that if it was the color of the connotation connected to the prostitute, it is considered an adept in the name of the Hoda When the appetite, because the color of the sign is connected to the appetite if the numbers are referred to, but it is not forbidden by the same So they loved the blindness on the guidance [it was separated: 17] The owner of the scout took three matters: the first: the fall of the misguidance in the metaphor of the guidance.Separate misguidance [Saba: 24].And the second: He says Mahdi in the position of the praise as a whole Praise; To invoke that he was guided, and he did not guarantee.And the third of it: that a folded hunger is a guidance, it is said: I guided him and he was lost, as it is said: I broken it, and it was broken, and I cut it, so it was cut off, so that the crushing and the lacquer is not to be broken.And the cutting, and the appetite must be from the palace of guidance.And the answer On the authority of the first: that the difference is between the guidance and between the guidance known to the harm, so the opposite of the guidance is the misguidance, and the opposite of the appetite is the misguidance, so he made the guidance in the guidance.And on the second: that the beneficial with the guidance is called a Mahdi, and other than the one who increases with it is not called a Mahdi; Because the liquid, if it did not lead to the intended, it was a house of the mantle.And on the third: that the ritualism is a good thing, it is said: It is a matter of time, and it was not necessary for him to be from the condition of his universe as a matter It is a guidance to be a member of the deduction, on the authority of his saying: his guidance is not guided, and what is indicated on the corruption of the person who said: The Qur’an described the Qur’an that it is a guidance, nor was it doubtful that it is not with knowledge, so it indicated that the guidance is the sign, not the deduction and the knowledge.(P-20) The second question: the righteous in the language is an active name from their saying, and it is up to him, and the seizure is the excess of the spur, if you know this, then say: God is the one who is the one who is the one The presentation of the praise, and whoever is like that is the first that it is fearful in the affairs of the world, but rather that it will be excluded when it connects with the debt, and that is the one who is a debt, and that is the one who is a minor On the prohibitions.And they differed that he entered the seduction of the listening in piety?And some of them said: He enters as he enters the listener in the return, and others said: He does not enter, and there is no conflict in the path of repentance from all, but the conflict is that if it is not.Is this name deserved?He narrated from him - peace be upon him - that he said: “The servant does not reach the ritual of the righteous until he calls what is not in it as a warning of what is with him from the authority of God.” About them: that they are the ones who warn of God, the pioneer in the leaving of what the fancy tends to him, and they hope for his mercy by believing what came from it.He knew that piety is fear, he said in the first women: O people, fear your Lord [the women: 1] and the same is in the first pilgrimage, and in the poets: when he said to them: 106] It means that you will not be afraid of God, and so he said Hood, a righteous, and a despair, and the peoples of their people, and in the cursing, Abraham said to his people: It means his fear, and so is his saying: Fear God, the right of His abnications [Al -Amran: 102] and provide it, because the best of the piety is [the cow: 197] The same thing [the cow: 48] and know that the truth of piety, and if it is the one that we mentioned, but it has come in the Qur’an, and the original abuse of it, the faith, And obedience is third, and the disobedience is left, and the salvation is fifth.Those who are the ones who have been the one who have been the ones who have the hearts of piety [the stone: 3].His saying: And if the people of the villages believe and fear [Al -Araf: 96], that is, they repented, and the obedience, then he said it in the bee: that they warn that there is no deity except for me Also: God bless you [the bee: 52] and in the believers and I am your Lord, you will fear [the believers: 52].[Al -Qarah: 189] That is, do not disobey it, and the salvation is saying it in the Hajj: It is from the strength of the hearts [Hajj: 32] that is, from the salvation of the hearts, so it says: 41] Know that the position of piety is a mahramal, he said: God is with those who fear and those who are good [the bee: 128] and he said: “I will be blessed with you” Ibn Abbas, peace be upon him said: Let it be in the hands of God, and he is not trustworthy than what is in his hand.Al -Hassan said: Piety is that you do not choose for God, and you know that all things are in the hands of God.Abraham Bin Adham said: Piety is that creation does not find a defect in your tongue, nor the angels in your actions as a defect, nor the king of the throne in your secret is a defect, and he said: The truth is as you adopted your backs of creation, and it is said: Piety is that you do not see your money where you are exhausted, and it is said: The one who is righteous is the one who is the path of the ritual The soul of the salvation and the flock, and the arrogance and the dryness, and if the righteous would not be a pioneer, except what is in the words of the Almighty: He is guided by those who are sufficient; Because it is exalted, indicating that the Qur’an is a gift for people in his saying: the month of Ramadan in which the Qur’an was revealed to the people [the cow: 185] and then he said: This is a guidance for the righteous, so this indicates that those who are righteous are all people, so whoever does not be excluded as if he is not a human being.(P-21) The third question: In the Questions: The first question: as the one of the things is guided and indicative, it is not different according to a person without a person, so why did he make the Qur’an?To the righteous only?Also, the righteous is guided, and the guided is not guided secondly, and the Qur’an is not guided by the righteous.Answer: The Qur’an is as it is a guidance for the righteous and a sign of them to the existence of the champions, and on his debt and sincerity of his Messenger, then it is also a sign of disbelief The righteous are praise to show that they are the ones who were guided and used to it as he said: but you It is warned of those who fear it [the disputes: 45] and he said: It is noteworthy who followed the remembrance [Yass: 11] and peace be upon him was a warning to all people, so he mentioned that These are those who took advantage of his warning, and as for those who interpreted the guidance with the connected significance to the intended, this question is a false about it; Because the Qur’an is connected to the intended, it is only in the right of the righteous.The second question: How and the Qur’an described all of the Qur’an that it is a lot of beautiful and similar.If not the connotation of the mind would not distinguish the arbitrator of the similar one, then the guidance will be in the truth is the mindset of the Qur’an, not the Qur’an, and from this we say from the authority of my son God is from him that he said to Ibn Abbas when he sent him a messenger to the Kharijites: Do not take them to the Qur’an, for it is a deity, and it is a man, and he said: This is in it; Because we see all the difference of Islam they broke it with it, and we see the Qur’an filling out of verses, some of which are clear in album With strict arrest, how is this guidance?Answer: That is the one who is similar and beautiful when it was not separated from what is meant by those who are aware - and it is either the connotation of the mind or the connotation of hearing - all of it became this.The third question: Everything that stands is the validity of the Qur’an as a pilgrimage to its authenticity, the Qur’an was not guided in it, so then the one who is as a matter The knowledge of the same God and his attributes, and in the knowledge of the prophecy, and there is no doubt that these demands are the honor of the students, so if the Qur’an is not guided by it Has it shot?Answer: It is not a condition of this guidance to be a guidance in everything, but it is sufficient for it to be guided in some things, and that is in that it is that it is a matter Or is this guidance in the affirmation of what is in the minds, and this is one of the strongest indications that the divorced person does not require the general, for God is upset and described it as a place The memorial, with the fact that it is a guidance in the proof of the artists and his attributes and the prophecy of the prophecy, so it has proven that the divorced person does not benefit the general.The fourth question: The guidance is the one who has been attained in the Bayan and the clarity to where it is otherwise, and the Qur’an is not like that, because the interpreters do not remember it A lot of incompatible, and what is like that is not shown in himself, as it is a matter of being clear to others, so how is this?We said: Whoever speaks to the interpretation in terms of displaying the opposite sayings, and no one of them is more likely to be on the rest, he is directed to him, this is the question, and we are the one who is a matter The seats in the spoiler, so this question is not directed to us.The loyal question: The owner of the “scout” said: The place of this is a gift For those who are righteous; Because it is a beginner, deleted or news with no doubt in it, or a beginner if the presuming is made, and it is permissible, and it is permissible, and it is permissible, and it is permissible, and it is permissible.(P-22) and the one in which the indication is in it, or the disobedience, and which is the established of a race in the rhetoric to strike from this field as a sacrifice, and that it is said: If it says: The virtues of the domers are independent of itself, and that book is a second sentence, and there is no doubt in it for a third and a guidance for the righteous people, and it may be in the past And the obligation of the good of the systems, where it comes with it, so that it is not the same as a letter of coordination, and that is for its coming, taking it, taking it to the one with the same In the first, and he went to the third, and the sequence.Bayan: that he was alerted first that he is the one who is defined by him, and then he was referred to that it is the book that was not the intention He clings to him a kind of rail, so it was a testimony of his money, and then he told him that he was a guidance for the righteous, so he acknowledged that, so that he did not.Not every one of this four was emptied after this is arranged by this elegant path from a joke, so in the first, the symbolism and the symbolism are in the wise man, and the one in the way, and the one who is the one who is in the same way Of the rawness, and in the third, what is in the validity of the Lord is on the custody, and in the four -year -old, the source of the source, which is the guidance of the position of the description that is the one.
