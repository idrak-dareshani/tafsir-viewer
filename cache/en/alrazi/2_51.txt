The researcher of the Quranic, the transcendent, when we prepared for four nights, then you took the hurry after him, and you are unjust, then forgive us from you, after that It is the third year.As for the saying of the Exalted, when we were prepared, Abu Omar and Jacob read.The three, but with a thousand thousand, it is a phenomenon because the promise was from God Almighty, and the divergence is a reaction, and there must be two of them, and for the thousand: God Almighty, his acceptance was from Moses, peace be upon him, and the acceptance of the promise that is likened to the promise; Because the subject of the promise is necessary, and he will do so.وثانِيها: قالَ القَفّالُ: لا يَبْعُدُ أنْ يَكُونَ الآدَمِيُّ يَعِدُ اللَّهَ ويَكُونَ مَعْناهُ يُعاهِدُ اللَّهَ.(And the third): It is a matter of two between two, so it is said that we are considered.And its elevation: It is the strongest that God is exalted and the promise of the living and He is the promise of God the coming of the mechanisms to the phase, but Moses is in his faces: It is easy, if he is folded in his walk, and peace be upon him, as well.And the second: its weight is effective, so the mim is an increase in it, and it is from the tree if I took the light on it, as if it was named for it.And the third of it: It is a compoundity of two words in the crossing.He was from Pharaoh, and he shouted him in the sea, and the wallets were paid until he entered it between the trees when it was in the house of Pharaoh.So they were grabbed, and they found the coffin, so they took it, so he called the name of the place where it was afflicted, which is water and the tree.And he knows that the first two deficiencies are the first place, but the first: because the sons of Israel and the dumplings were not speaking in the language of the Arabs, so it is not permissible for you to be the one who will be.Because this word is the name of a flag and the name of science does not benefit a meaning in the self and the closest is the third direction, which is a matter of usual among the people, so the lineage of it.Bin Ya`bah ibn Qahith ibn Lawy ibn Yaqoub ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al -Salam, peace be upon them.As for the saying of the Almighty: Four nights are in the research: The first search: that Moses, peace be upon him, said to the sons of Israel: If we come out of the sea, peace be upon you Show you, in which you must do the verb and release, so when he visited Moses Al -Bahar in the sons of Israel, and God is placed, so they said: O Moses, come to us.He went to his Lord, and they promised them four night So the meeqaat of his Lord was four nights [Al -Araf: 142], and Harun was assigned to them and he stayed on the phase of four nights, and God has revealed to God Zabraj, the Lord brought him close to him, and he spoke to him, and he was listened to him.Al-Tura: The second research: Rather, he said four nights, because the Shahur begins from the Leila.Moses promised us four nights, as they said: The day is four days since the way of so -and -so, that is, the fourth of the fourth, and the one who has been added to the addition, As in the words of the Almighty: I ask the village [Yusuf: 82] and also, it is not what is meant to spend any of the fourths, but four years, which is the three of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the thirty of the one who is The pilgrimage is that Moses, peace be upon him, was a scholar that what is meant is these fourth, and he also said to him: And when we promised Moses for four nights, it is a night.Before these fourth, he will come to the mountains of these fourths until the Tawaurus is revealed to him, and it is necessary that it is that it is that it is a matter He promised that he will be removed after that, and this second imitator is the one who supports the news.The loyal research: Its saying here: And when we were considered to be four nights, it is beneficial that the diligent was one of the first of the matter on the four, and his saying in the norms: And we completed it with ten [Al -Araf: 142] It is beneficial that the diligent was at the beginning of the matter on the thirty -year -old, so how to fulfill between them?Al -Hasan replied the Basra and he said: It is not intended that his promise was thirty nights, and then after that, and he promised him twenty, but he is four, and he is three nights, and he is three.Days in Hajj and seven if you return that complete ten [Al -Baqara: 196].As for his words, the Exalted: Then you took the calf after him, and he has research: the first search: it was mentioned for the word “then” because it is the highest and the one who is up to the one Al -Tawara on him in the presence of the seventy.And it appeared in that, Moses, peace be upon him, and the grace of the children of Israel, to be a warning to those who are present to those who are on their ways For the religion, that was one of the greatest blessings, so when they came to the one that came with the ugliness of the types of ignorance and infidels, that was in the place of admiration, so whoever says: And so, then you intend me with worsening and harm.The second research: The people of the Cir Moses, Moses, said to his brother Aaron: I am in my people in my people and do not follow and do not follow the path of the spoilers [Al -Arif: 142], so when he went to Moses, and it was my soul The Israel of the clothes and the righteous, whom they have listened to from the roll, said to them, Aaron: This is the clothes and the righteous, it is not permissible for you, so they burned it, so they gathered a fire and burned it, and it was burned, Moses, peace be upon him, in the sea, looked at the Dabbah Jabril, peace be upon him, when he was presented to Pharaoh in the entry of the sea, so he gave a jungle The bear, then the Samaritan took what was with him from gold and silver and portrayed from him with a hurry, and that dust in which he was in it, so he came out of it as a voice, as if he was the one who said: Your God and God Moses [Taha: 88], so the people took him to God for themselves, so this is what is in the narration, and a saying to say: The great group is from the mind, and it is not possible that they do not know.His corruption in the beginning of the mind, and this is the story, as well as his faces: one of it: that every sane person knows the beginning of his mind, that the idol is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not He feels and does not understand that he will be the God of the heavens and the earth, and he endowed that he appeared from a hoop, but this destiny is not reconciled to be a suspicion in the heart of one of the hearts God.And the second: that the people had witnessed before that from the miracles that are the miracle that is close to the extent of the exaggeration in (P-71) the significance of the sake of the peace and the sincerity of the peace of the peace So the power of this sign and its manifestation has gone to the limit of the deportation, and with the fact that the breasts of the hurricane from that hurry, which is taken from the gold, is that it is necessary to need to be in the case The vote is God.The answer is: This is the one that can only be corrected on one side, and it is said: The Samaritan is the one who brings to the people that Moses, peace be upon him, is what he has been able Slasses on the forces of Kikiya, and he was appreciated by these miracles, so the Samaritan said to the people: I take you to a proverb, like the same That is, that he made him a wonderful voice of it, so he reassured them to become like a place of peace be upon him in the coming, or for the sake, And solutions, so they allowed the solutions of God in some of the bodies, so they made them sit in that suspicion.The third research: this is the story in which there are benefits: one of it: it indicates that the nation of Muhammad ﷺ is the best of the nations; لِأنَّ أُولَئِكَ اليَهُودَ مَعَ أنَّهم شاهَدُوا تِلْكَ البَراهِينَ القاهِرَةَ اغْتَرُّوا بِهَذِهِ الشُّبْهَةِ الرَّكِيكَةِ جِدًّا, وأمّا أُمَّةُ مُحَمَّدٍ ﷺ فَإنَّهم مَعَ أنَّهم مُحْتاجُونَ في مَعْرِفَةِ As the Qur’an is miraculous to the accurate indicators, they did not overwhelm the great lips, and that indicates that This nation is better than those and completes a mind and is a risk of them.And the second: that he, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned this story with the fact that he did not learn knowledge, and that indicates that he is the prayer and peace be upon him.And the third of it: in which there is a great warning of imitation and ignorance of the evidence, for these are the people if they know God with the evidence, in full, in full Samari.And the sequence of it: In the abuse of the Prophet ﷺ from what was witnessed by the Arabs of the Arabs, the Jews and the Christians with the difference to him, as if he was up to him with patience, as well This is the certainty, then they were saved by God from Pharaoh and the miraculous miracles of miracles from the first appearance of Moses to that time.The knife, then Moses, peace be upon him, be patient with that, because Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, be patient with the harm of his people.Fifthly: that the most arguable people with the Messenger ﷺ and an enmity for him are the Jews, as if he is up to the Almighty, he said: These are these, but they are in their predecessors.And stubbornness to this limit, how is this one.As for the saying of the Almighty: You are unjust, and it has research: the first search: in the interpretation of injustice and in it and Jahan: the first: the father of the Muslim said: Exalted: All the two gardens came to eat and did not oppress anything from it [Al -Kahf: 33], and the meaning is that when they left the worship of the Mihqi al -Mu’ihit, the death of the dead and the absence of the death of the death They became incomplete in the goodness of religion and worldly.The second: that the injustice in the knowledge of the law is a phrase from the empty repetition of a benefit that increases it and the payment of a harmful one is greater than it and the right to the one who is in the way of it.The verb with this adjective was his actor unjust, then the man, if he does what leads him to punishment and fire, was said: He is an unjust himself, and if he is the one who said: A great injustice [Laqiman: 13], and he said: Some of them are unjust to itself [Fatir: 32] and when their worshipers were for the goodness of God, and the evil is a good one.The second research: the disgraced, the one who said it: You are unjust that the sins are not with the creation of God Almighty (p-72) from the one who is: He is created for God, the Almighty, as he deserved the defamation, except for those who did it.And the second: that if it was in the will of God, they would be obedient to God, with the Almighty, because obedience is a phrase for the act of what is meant.And the third of it: If the disobedience was created for God, the Almighty would have been given the reason for the course of the defamation of the hearts of the same as the one who is a good, the father, the ablution, the one.The answer: This holds the action of praise and the slander, and it is opposed to my preacher and knowledge question [and we presented] that is a secret.The third research: In the verse, it is alerted that the harm of the infidels only returns to them because they did not benefit About the interlocutor of the selection of emancipation and the decrease in the disobedience of the hardships.As for the saying of the Exalted: Then our forgiveness from you after that, and the dismissed said: What is meant and then our pardon for you by the reason Weak of two voices: The first: that the acceptance of repentance is a reason for a mind.The verses are the number of God's blessings be upon them.The second: The pardon is a name for the projection of the punishment, but the overthrow of what must be overthrown, then that is not called pardon, do you not see that the oppressor is not for what is not permissible for him The shadow, if it is left that torment, is not called pardon, then this is our way, and if this is proven, then we say, there is no doubt in the crops of the repentance in this So you repent to your innocence, and kill yourself [the cow: 54] and if it is like that, this verse indicates that the acceptance of the repentance is not, and if it is a reason, then it is a reason, and if it is a reason, and if it is a reason, and if it is a reason, and if it is a reason, and if it is a reason, and if it is a reason, and if it is a reason The exalted, the punishment for those who are permissible to punish his mind and a law, and that is also the difference of the saying of the dismissed, and if it is proven that he is pardoned by the disbelief The division of the nation of Muhammad ﷺ with them: the best of a nation was brought out to people [Al -Amran: 110] was the first.As for his words, the Almighty: Perhaps you will thank you, so know that the words are in interpretation.Thank you, and what is a pioneer, and he will come, if God wills, the Almighty, then the dismissed said: He is the Almighty, indicating that he has forgiven them and did not take them to you, and they would not take them, and they will be taken.The Almighty only received from them.And the answer: If God wanted to be high, thank them, then he would have wanted that either a condition that he will give the complainant to the first thanks of this condition, and the first is the first of the condition, and the first is the one who is invalid.If this condition is from the servant, then the preacher of the preacher is required to be another call, and if it was from God, then the creation of God called the thank you, and the righteousness is not.The rhetoric of the thank you, and that against the saying of the dismissed, and if he wanted to get the thank you from it other than this preacher, then he wanted from him the referral because the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who wanted to do so She proven that the forms are and responded to them as well, and God knows.
