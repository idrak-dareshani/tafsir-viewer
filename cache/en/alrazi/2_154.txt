The Quranic researcher (P-132) said by the Almighty and do not say to those who kill in the path of God, there are no life, but you are not aware, but you do not feel that I know that this verse is the one who says: Rather, they live with their Lord Meaning of my enemy with your money and your dispensation, so you did so, and your souls wrapped, so do not count that you are lost yourself, but know that you kill you, and I will kill you.The first question: Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with him - said: The verse came down to killing Badr, and he was killed by the Muslims on the twelve man, one of the ten men, a man of one of the ten men And one of the supporters, and among the migrants: Ubaydah ibn al -Harith ibn Abd al -Mutlab, Umar ibn Abi Waqas, and the two north, and Amr ibn al -Nafil.Bakr, and Bin Abd Allah.Among the supporters: Said bin Khayakhah, Qass bin Abd al -Mundhir, Zaid ibn al -Harith, Tamim ibn al -Hammam, and the Rafah ibn al -Mu’ali, and al -Muhari al -Mu'tal Bin Afra, and Awf ibn Afra, and they were saying: So -and -so died and so -and -so died, so God ended the Almighty to say that they had died.On the other hand, the disbelievers and the hypocrites said: People kill themselves as a request for the pleasure of Muhammad, who is unique, and this is revealed.The second question: (Mother) raised; Because it is a beginner, deleted, its estimated: do not say they are the tools.The third question: In the verse there are sayings: The first saying: that in the time they are life, as if God has revived them to bring the reward to them, and this is the saying of more than the one who is the most.The obedient will reach their rewards to them while they are in the graves, so it was said: We see their bodies dead in the graves, so how do you correct what you have gone to?We said: As for us, the structure is not a condition in life, and there is no abuse that God restores life to every one of those atoms and parts of the small to the one who is not the same When the disgraced, it is not far from God to restore life to the parts that must be in the life of alive and is not considered to be considered a kind, and it is also necessary to live if they do not.The second saying: The deaf said: It means that you do not call them the dead, and they said to them the witnesses of life, and it is necessary that the participants said: They are the most powerful in the debt as God said: [Al -Anam: 122] And he said: Do not say to the martyrs what the participants said, but they said: They are life in religion, but they do not feel, the one who does not know is that those who knew do not know.The debt of Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - is alive in religion, and on the guidance of his Lord and light, as it was narrated in some of the stories that a man said For a man: a man did not die like that, and he was told about Batrouka that he was saying to his students: they were dead by the will live with the kindness.The third saying: that the participants used to say: The companions of Muhammad ﷺ kill themselves and lose their life, and they will come out of the world, without the world.Nothing, and these are those who said that, it is enticed that they were (P-133) an age that denies the re-offered, and it is possible that they were believers, but they were not.Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him -, so they said these words, so God Almighty said: And do not say as the partners said that they are the tools that they do not spread and do not pay off Al -Shadid in the world, but they know that they are life, that is, they will live, and they will be rewarded and they are blessed in paradise, and the interpretation of his saying: God Almighty: The righteous is in a nickname, and the jaws are in hell [breakfast: 13-14].Those who believed and did the righteous in the gardens of the nickname [Hajj: 56] in the sense that they will make it like that, and this saying is the choice of the Kaabi, and my father is a Muslim, and the father The scholars are on the authority of the first saying, which is indicated by his faces: one of them: the verses indicative Two two [Ghafir: 11] and the two deaths are only when the life of life is in the grave, and God Almighty said: They were placed and they entered a fire [Noah: 25] It is a lunch and a long time, and the day will take place, and enter the family of Pharaoh, the most severe torture [Ghafir: 46] and if the torment of the grave is proven, the saying is necessary for the sake of the grave.Because the torment is the right of God to the servant of the servant, and the reward is a right for the servant to God Almighty, so the projection of the punishment is better than the projection of the reward, so when the punishment of the punishment is to the punishment He achieved it in the grave, that was in the first reward.And secondly: that the meaning was if it was said in the second and third saying, it was not for it: but you do not feel a meaning; Because the discourse of the believers and they did not know that they would live on the day of the day, and that they died on this guidance and light, so he did not say that the matter is what he said to us Their graves.And the third of it: that it is said: and they are preaching to those who did not catch up with them [Al -Imran: 170] indicate that life is in the button before the Baath.And its elevation: His saying - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -: “The grave is a ritual from the whiteness of paradise or a fossil of the fossil of fire.Prayer and peace - he says in the last of his prayers: “And I seek refuge in you from the torment of the grave.” Fifth: If it was intended from his saying: that they lived that they would live, then he will not be able to do so, so that they will not be satisfied with this About him is a Muslim, that he is the Almighty, but he specialized in the remembrance, because they were dedicated to paradise, and they were raised and honored by the highest.With those who have been blessed with the prophets, the righteous, the righteous, and the righteous [women: 69], so he wanted them to be a great.The prophets and the righteous are great with the fact that God is the Almighty.We mentioned it, and the father of a Muslim took over his saying that he was the highest of this verse in the family of Amran, so he said: Rather, it is a life for the Lord of the Lord Possible, but in the form of paradise, and knowing that the people of the reward do not enter paradise except after the resurrection.Paradise, but by the rituals of the trades and the delivery of the gospels to it while it is in the grave or in another position, and know that there is another saying in the verse, which is: that the reward of the grave and its torment is not for the sake Building on the definition of the spirit, and we spread to the conclusion of the saying of these words, so we say: They said that the human being is not permissible to be a dormant for this It will be a warmth of this meal, so the first face: The parts of this ever are the parts of the growth in the growth, the vigor, the Ziadah, the deficiency, the slave, the slander, the slander, the slander, the slander, the slander, the slander, and the slander, Where it is a rest of his age, and the rest is other than what remains, and the referred to him is at every one who said: (I) must be a misery of this.I am a scientist that I am if I am unaware of all my parts and my hearts, and the information is not what is not known, so who refers to it with my saying (I) is the one who is the one who does not.As for the human being, it is not good, because the sensual is the surface and the color, and there is no doubt that the human being is not the extermination of the color and the surface, then the one who disperses that To him every one of his saying (I) is any thing that is in it, and the words are in it, but the most severe, and the sake of it.The fire is in the joy, the fat of the poisoning, and the water of the cold in the cold, and those who say this saying are two.For the parties of the parts from which this is the same, but the fierce charity is the same.Some of the parts of the first age to the end of it are the parts of which are the ones who refer to every one by saying (I), then if the parts are alive with a life, then it is a life, then it is a life that creates it Life is still died, and this is the saying of the most speaking.And secondly: Those who believed in disagreement of the bodies and claimed that the bodies that are the rest of the first life to the last life are the bodies contrary to the essence and the right to the one who is from the sake This is the elderly, and those bodies are alive for their own perception of itself, so if this body is mixed and became valid in this height, the fire of the fire is in the fool of the fool.The spirit is moving by moving it, then this is ever in the dirt, the dissolution, and the replacement, except that the parts are remaining in their condition, but it does not present to it.Because it is contrary to the gay of these obvious bodies, then if this heart is closed, those gentle, light bodies will be separated to the world Da'a, and to hell and the world of pests, if you are from the rhetoric of the hardships.And the second saying: that the one who refers to every one of it is said to him: (I am a struggle) is not a bias, nor does he do the conqueror, and that he is not a matter It is also that it is the same as God Almighty; Because the partner in the Silkuk does not require the vision in the essence, and they needed that in the fact that the information is not true, so it is necessary for it to be the knowledge of the knowledge The description of that science will be a truly individual, and every body and every case in the body is not truly an individual, so that is what he believes in it.It should not be a body or a body.As for the information, it is a truly an individual, because there is no doubt about the existence of something, then this supplies, if it is a truly individual, is the one who is required, and if it is a ride, then it is a richness Excess, then the individual must be at all cases, and if it is in the information what is an individual was in the information what is an individual; Because the knowledge that is attached to that individual, if it is divided, each one of its parts or some (P-135) is its parts, either that it is the knowledge of the knowledge; Because it is necessary for the part to be equal to all and it is referred, or that nothing of its parts are knowledgeable with that knowledge Excess is the knowledge of that unique knowledgeable, then the knowledge of that knowledgeable is this of this is the jurisprudence of those who are not the same.How if it is divided by the hadith in it, and if it is not divided, it is the one who is required He accepted the division, and the description of it was also, as well With his fullness, then the one is the one present in many things that are referred, or the parts of the situation are distributed to the parts A division, or nothing, from the parts of the place, except with the completion of the situation, and nothing of the parts of that situation, so that this is that the place is free from the case, and it is in the case.This is backward, and as for every bias, it is divided, in the states of the mortal in the denial of the individual, they said: I have proven that the one who indicates to him: Mawdoud) is not a bias, and there is no existing.Then we say: This is the supply of it is a blessing of the parties; Because I cannot judge this person referring to him that he is a human being and is not a mare, and the ruler is something about something that is necessary and that it is necessary for the one who is to be present.It is perceived for this partial and for the whole human being so that he can judge this entirety on this part of the whole and perceived of the entirety is the soul Also, it is the soul, for everyone who is a blessing for the parties is that it is not possible to enjoy and get up She will come to and give up until God returns to the forefront on the Day of Resurrection, so there is a time and pain for the eternity, so this is a saying that he said: A proof of proof is based on the saying of it, but there is no evidence on its corruption, for it is what supports the law and supports the phenomenon of the Qur’an, and the Qur’an is not.The book of God is one of the reward and torment of the grave, so the destiny is obligatory to it, for this is the reference that is evacuated in its success.They said: And from what this saying is confirmed is that the reward of the grave and its torment is either to reach this structure or to a part of its parts, and the first is an arrogant because we find this A separated separate, so how can the saying of the reward and punishment be said to?So it remains only to be said: God Almighty revives some of these small parts and the reward and punishment will be reached to it, and if it is permissible, then it is not permissible to say: Differences and tears, so there is no crime to which pain and pleasure prayed to him, then he is their pursuit of it and the exaltation that returns the spirit to the body on the day of the Great Resurrection, until the exhaust Spiritualism.
