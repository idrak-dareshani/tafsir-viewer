The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: It is among the people who involve himself to abide by the pleasure of God, and God is raised with worshipers, I know that he is up to what he described in the verse To demand the world, it is mentioned in this verse in the case of those who make its world, its soul, and its money to seek the religion, so he said: And among the people who see the soul is the pleasure of God Institutions: The first question: In the reason for the descent, a narration: one of them: Ibn Abbas narrated that this verse was descended in Sahab ibn Sinan, Mawla Abdullah, and the son of God.Bin Yasser, and in the name of his mother, in Yasser his father, in Bilal Mawla Father (P-174) Bakr, and in Khabab ibn Al-Art, and in the garbage of Mawli, he took them.As for a lust, he said to the people of Makkah: I am a great sheikh, and I have money and goods, and I will not harm you, I was from you or from your enemy, I spoke to me, and I will give it to me, and I will give it to me.And my goodness and bought from you my debt, so they were satisfied with that and they made it a way, so he left back to the city, so the verse was revealed, and when he entered the man of the man May God be pleased with him, and he said to him: May God bless you.And he said: God descended in you such, and read the verse on him, and as for Khabab ibn Al -Art and Abu Dhrar, he lost the city and came to the city.Yasser was killed, and the rest of the people were given the cause of torment, some of what the participants wanted, and they left, and they were descended from the words [Al -Nahla: 41] With the torment of the people of Mecca, for their prophets in the world, good [Al -Nael: 41] with victory and spoil And its heart is reassured by faith.And the second novel: that it came down in a man who ordered a well -known and forbidden from Makarar, on the authority of Omar, Ali and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them.And the third novel: I descended in Ali ibn Abi Talib who became on the bed of the Messenger of God ﷺ the night of his exit to the laurel, and it is narrated that when he slept on his bed When his head, Michael, he has his legs, and Gabriel calls: a slaughter of a puff from you, O son of my father, a student, and God bless you.* * * Suffering it with the reward of the hereafter, and this sale is that it is its vigilance in obedience to God, from prayer, fasting, pilgrimage and jihad, and then it was connected to that to the goodness of the reward of God Like the castle, and it became the best of the preacher, and God is like the Mashtari, as he said: God is bought by the believers himself and their mothers that they have paradise [the ritual: 111] God has called a merchant, so he said: O you who believe, do I show you on a merchant that will save you from a passionate torment that believe in God and the Messenger of God In your money and yourself [Al -Saf: 10] and for me that it is possible to conduct the purchase of the purchase on its appearance, and that is that whoever is presented to the infidels, the evil, the evil, the shedding in the deeds of the religion The hereafter was fell in the permanent torment, and it became in the position as if its soul was for him, so because of the disbelief and the immorality, it was out of his kingdom, and it became a right to the The disbelief, the immorality, and the advancement of faith and obedience, became as if he had become his soul from the torment and fire, so the state of the believer became like the offices, and they will make their house with a nomad The believer makes a numerous breath, and his soul is ever.One soul in the world, and for this, Jesus, peace be upon him, said: And my two prayers with prayer and zakat as long as I have been alive [Maryam: 31] and he said to the Prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him: Al -Yakin comes to you [Al -Hijar: 99].If it was said: God Almighty has made his soul as a shame, when he said: God is bought by the believers himself and their money [the repentance: 111], and this is the one who is forbidden.We said: There is no contradiction between the two of the two things, so it is the one who is bought by a servant, for each one of them is good, and each one of them is a shadow, (p-175), so this is so, so this is so, so this is the same, so this is the same and so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so.To leave the phenomenon and to carry the purchase of sale.If you know this, then he says: He enters under this, every hardship that a person can bear in the request of religion, so he enters into it, and he enters into it.The killing, as Abu Ammar and his mother did, and enter the remains from the infidels to the Muslims, and enter the destroyed himself from the disbelievers, as well It is in it in which the one who shows religion and the right is in it.It was narrated that Omar, may God be pleased with him.Omar: You have lied to the mercy of God, and he read: And among the people who see himself is the abuse of the pleasure of God, then I know that the hardship that does not take it And the age of the law until it enters the reason for the verse, but if it was in the shadow of the law, then it is not within it, but it is considered that in the door He feared the wrapping when the seduction of the genius did, and Qutdah said: As for God, they are not in the people They saw The polytheists prayed with God, another God who fought against the religion of God and spread themselves anger for God and jihad in His path.The second question: it is the same as the pleasure of the pleasure of God, that is, to abide by the pleasure of God, and “in the sense” in the sense of being bought.As for His Excellency: And God is a lord of worshipers, so whoever believes that he made the sleeping sleep a reward for a few deeds, and whoever is a lump The infidelity is a meeting on the soul, and from his opinion that it does not cost a soul except its capacity and from its heads and his mercy that the Egypt is on the disbeliever, if there is no I drop all of that punishment.He gave him the permanent reward, and from his opinion that the soul is for him and the money, then he is buying his king with his king, virtue of him, mercy and charity.
