The researcher is the Almighty: God does not take you with the language of your faith, but he takes you what you have earned your hearts, and God is forgiven in the verse: The fall that is not accustomed to it, whether it was words or otherwise, but the arrival of this word in the words, so it is indicated by the verse, the news and the narration, but the verse, and the verse, Logo exposed him [Al -Qasas: 55], and his saying: They do not hear in it a linguistic or a sinful [Al -Waqihah: 25], and his saying: Do not hear for this, [26] And his saying: high in which you do not hear in it [Al -Ghaffiya: 11], but his saying: And if they pass through the language, pass a rum Be lord, and that the intended will be: and if they pass the action that will be lukewarm.As for the news, he said it ﷺ: “Whoever says the day of the group is for his friend: his righteousness, and the imam is speaking to you.” As for the novel, it is said: The fold of the ritual is luminously: if you vote, and the rituals are looked at: his vote, and the arrival of this memorization is that it is not the words that it is not.Among the children of the camels: a lukewar, Jarir said: The people are prepared by the children of the homes of the glory of four of the elders, and they are brought out from the vision of the rituals of the way.Al -Ajej said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ With the language.As for those who are the ones who have mentioned his faces: The first: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: He said the Arab In them, the solution, even if it was said to be one of them: I heard you the day, you will be solved in the mosque, a thousand times a thousand, because that, and perhaps he said: And the second: It is the saying of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him: that prostration is that he is solved on something that believes that he was then that he was not, then this is the one, and this is this Al -Shafi’i is not obligated to infidelity in the saying of the man: No, God, and God, and God, and obliging it to if he is alive on something that he believes that he was then that he was not.Abu Hanifa is judged by the one.And the opinion of Al -Shafi’i is the saying of Aisha and Al -Shaabi and Akrama.And the saying of Abu Hanifa is the saying of Ibn Abbas, Al -Hassan, Mujahid, Al -Nakhwi, Al -Zahri, Silmann ibn Yasar, Qatada, Al -Saddi and Makhoul.The Hajj of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, is on his saying, the first: The Aisha, may God be pleased with him, narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “ His words: God, God, and God, and God, and God, “and narrated that he ﷺ passed (P-67) with people who are misleading and with him a man from his companions, then a man who is a man who said: And God.Then he made a mistake, then he said who with the Prophet ﷺ: The man's sneezing, O Messenger of God.He said ﷺ: “Every hand of archers is a linguist, not as disbelief in it, nor a punishment.” On the authority of Aisha that she said: I want the prostitution that was not in humor, the privileges, and the chapters.The companions of the interpretation of the words of God enriched the Hajj.That the right of the right is like the opposite opposite, as it is caused by the causation of the heart, but what is meant is from his saying: What has your hearts has earned is the one who is the one And his heart is attached to him, and if he is like that, the prostitution that is like the opposite of him is that he is not intended by what the human being does not mean, and he does not The people say the way to repent in the words: No, by God, peace and God, but if he is overwhelmed by something that he was, then he did not appear, then he did not.The right is to believe the saying of itself and the heart of his heart was attached to that, so it was not for that, but it was a decree, but it was caught by the heart of the heart.Remember before this verse: and do not make God a display of your faith, and we have mentioned that it is forbidden for the many sweets and the right, and the one who says: Jading: No, God, and God, and God, there is no doubt that they abound in the solution, so he mentioned the Almighty to say: And do not make God a luxury for your faith They multiply the al -Half on the way of the benefit in the words, not on the way of the intention to the solution, and he indicated that there is no delay in them and no disbelief; It leads to either until they refrain from talking, or they are obligated in every moment of disbelief, and both of them embarrassed in religion, so it appeared that the interpretation of the absence of what we mentioned is what we have.The verse, as for the one who said Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, it does not suit what before the verse, so the interpretation of Al -Shafi’i was the first.The first pilgrimage: His saying ﷺ: On the authority of the chapter, it is divorced from the second one.The two pilgrims are the infidels in the saying of people: No, God, peace and God, if he gets the slander, then the one who indicates that prostration is not possible to say, It must be interpreted by what Abu Hanifa said is that the right in the language is a phrase of power.For a glorified ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ What is meant by the right is to strengthen the side of the righteousness on the side of the mutation in the causes of the right, and this is done in the position that is subject to the piety, and this is the time The right is a verb in the future, but if the right is signed over the past, then this is not accepted by the dignity of the dead The one who is required of it, and the one who is devoid of the one who is required to be a luminous, has proven that the linguist is the right of the past, and the right -wing is on the one who is accepted.This Yemeni is free from the obligatory, and you will not be a linguist.A disobedience, for this is the right of linguistics, and it is disobedience.He said: And if they hear the linguist, they expose it [Al -Qasas: 55], then he showed that he is not taken by the blessing of these days, then he said: But he is taken from you With your residence on that, whom you have made from the leaving of obedience and the act of disobedience, they said: And this interpretation is contrary to the saying of peace be upon him: It is better than it, so it is the one who is the best and then to disbelieve.The verse of the extension of his words is up to him: but he takes you what you have held the days, then his atonement [Al -Maaidah: 89], and when what is meant by the misfortune is the affliction of the disbelief And a duty, we know that what is meant by the verse is not this image.The second: It is the Almighty to make the intercourse to the linguistics is the causation of the heart, and it is not possible to interpret it with what it mentioned from the causes of the thing that they have been replaced; Because the calamity of the heart is broken by a new act, but the one who drew on what was not called the calamity of the heart.The loyal saying in the interpretation of the eaten: that it is the disbelieving right, it was called a lumin With language if you disbelieve, and this is the saying of the laugh.The fifth saying, which is the saying of the judge: that what is meant by it is an easy way that is not intended Your hearts, that is, take you if you deliberately * * * You have earned your hearts and said in the verse of the extended: but I take you as you have held the days [Al -Maradah: 89] and the consequences of the right are a minor, because the one who is intended is from it.And because it is intended for it The contract that leads to the solution, so when he mentioned our saying: What your hearts have earned our knowledge that what is meant by that contract is the contract of the heart, and the one who is the same, It shows that that is the case of what it is, and he explained it in the verse of the extended by saying: But he takes you what you have held, so I will disbelieve it [Al -Ma’idah: 89] The infidels, each one of these two verses is a summary of the face, indicated from another side, so each one of them became an utilitarian for the last one, and from one side That every day is mentioned on the path of grandfather and the heart of the heart, so the disbelievers are obligatory in it, and the oath of the clouds like that, so the disbelievers were obligatory in it.As for his words, the Almighty is: And God is a dream, and you have learned that the Forgiving is exaggerated in the sins of sins, and in the overthrow of its minds, and the dream is that the dream is that the dream is that And the tranquility, it is said: Put the roar on the darkness of the camels, that is: the most severe in the path, and the dream; Because it is seen in the case of the tranquility, the dream of the bare, and the meaning of the dream in the characteristic of God: who is not accelerated with the punishment, but the agony is delayed.
