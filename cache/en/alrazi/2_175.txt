The researcher of the Quranic: These are those who have bought the delusional of the guidance and the torment of forgiveness, so what happened to them on the fire.Know that he was upset when he described the scholars of Jews as the right of the truth and greatly in the return to him, and he described that crime to know that this is the punishment.He knew that the action is either considered to be in the world or in the last, but in the world, the best things are the best of the knowledge and the ugly of the things that are misguided and ignorant, so what is the same The world, and they are satisfied with misguidance and ignorance, so they do not doubt that they are in the end of the loss in the world.They were satisfied with torment, so he did not doubt that they are at the end of the loss in the last.And if they described them on what we mentioned, they were not the case of the greatest people as a loss in the world and in the hereafter, but it was judged by them that they bought the torment; Because when they were aware of what was the truth, and they were aware that it is in its purification and the removal of the suspicion of it, the greatest reward, and in its hide and the righteousness Hide that right was a prestige of the forgiveness of torment, not referral.* * * As for his saying: What is the best of them on the fire, in it, he has the books: the first question: I know that in this memorization two sayings: one of them: that (what) in this (what) is in this Tobar with its meaning: What is the one who patted them and anything that patience with them on fire until they left the right and followed the falsehood, and this is the saying of Ata and Ibn Zaid.Ibn al -Anbari said: It may be be patient in the sense of patience and many, so that I would do in the sense of, so we did the part of the generosity and generosity, and informed and told.The second: It is in the sense of admiration, and its acknowledgment is that the one who is satisfied with something must be satisfied with it, and it is necessary to be satisfied with it, and if it is aware of it, then it is the one who knows that The fire is obligated and the torment of God is required with their knowledge with that, they have become satisfied with the torment of God Almighty, and those who are patient with him, so that he said: “So what is the best of them, and what is the best of the fire.” It is exposed to what the anger of the Sultanate is required: I have not been patient with arrest and prisons.If you know this, it appears that it is obligatory to carry his saying: So what happened to them on the fire in their condition in the world; Because this is a description of them in the event of action, and in the event of their persistence in the guidance of the guidance.Al-Asam said: What is meant is that if they are said to them, they will be lost in it and do not speak [the believers: 108], then they are silent (P-26) and be patient with the fire for the sake of salvation.This is a weakness for Wajah: one of them: that God Almighty described them immediately, so he told him that they would see as well as the disagreement of the back.And the second: that the people of the fire may fall from them, the severity and the disturbance.The second question: in the truth of the admiration and in the verge indicating it in the language.We are: the first search: in admiration: it is the same as the thing with the hidden because of the greatness of that thing, so what is not the meaning of this person is not the same.The original, then the word of the admiration may be used to the exaggeration of the recovery, other than the hidden reason, or otherwise it will be for the greatness, and the exaltation is that The readers of those who read, but wonder and harnessed [Al -Saffat: 12] by adding the vita of “my wonder”, so he saw that the hidden thing is that God is referred.قالَ النَّخَعِيُّ: مَعْنى التَّعَجُّبِ في حَقِّ اللَّهِ تَعالى مُجَرَّدُ الِاسْتِعْظامِ, وإنْ كانَ في حَقِّ العِبادِ لا بُدَّ مَعَ الِاسْتِعْظامِ مِن خَفاءِ السَّبَبِ كَما أنَّهُ يَجُوزُ إضافَةُ السُّخْرِيَةِ And the mockery and the ritual to God Almighty, not in the sense that is added to worshipers.The second research: Know that for two formulas: one of them: what I did as his saying is up to Him: So what happened to them on the fire.The second: Do it as his saying: Hear them and see [Maryam: 38].As for the first phrase: it is their saying; What I be patient; So do it.The first saying: It is the choice of the visionary that (what) is a vague nick that is highlighted by the appetite, and the best is a verb and it is the news of the beginning and the increased and the one who is a good and a hardship: That is, it is good.He knew that this saying when the Kufi is a pardon, and they embarrassed him with his faces: The first: that it is correct to say: What is the honor of God, and what he knows, and what he knows, It is impossible to say: something that God has made generous, great and knowledgeable; Because the attributes of God are their pursuit and an obligation to himself.If it was said: This is the word, if it is released, as it is permissible for it to be the ones who are intended from it.Hitra, which is the same.We said: If we say what God has glorified, then the word (what) is here, it is not in the sense of anything, then you will not be a beginner, and it is not the greatest of his news, so there is no one who has been Likewise, it was proven that the interpretation of this verse with these things is in the place of admiration, so it is not correct.The second pilgrimage: that if it was the meaning of our saying: I did not improve more; Something is good, and it is obligatory to remain the meaning of admiration if we declare this words, and knowing that if we say: something is good, then it is not the same.Rather, it was like this, so we knew that it is not permissible to interpret our saying: I did not improve the increase in our saying: something is good.The third pilgrimage: that the one who has good, the sun, the moon, and the world is God, His Glory and Him, and it is not permissible to express it with “what”, and if it is permissible for it, then it is permissible for you to do so.“Who” is the first, then he would have been over, if we did not say: Whoever is good is more than that the meaning of admiration remains, and when he did not know our knowledge, the corruption of what they said.The fourth pilgrimage: that the interpretation that said there is no difference between his saying: What is good for more and between his saying: Zoud, he is a life, so it is that there is no age, so that it is that it is a matter The first is like that.(P-27) The Fifth Hajj: that every adjective has been proven to the thing, and it is proven to him either to have it from himself or others, so if the influence is in the right We himself or others, and on the two estimates, something that is good, either, either that the thing is its soul or otherwise, then the knowledge of the knowledge of it, then the knowledge is not.Drouring, and the knowledge of his being is a fanatic of it, so it is not a warning, because it is not permissible to interpret our saying: What is good for our saying is good.The sixth pilgrimage: that they said: The beginning is not permissible to be a denial, so how can they make it the most intense things that are a beginner?And they said: It is not permissible to say: a writer; Because every one knows that in the world a man is a writer, then this words are useful: and so every one knows that something is the one who is good in this?The seven argument: the entry of the miniature that is the characteristic of the names in your saying: what is good for more, if it was said: the entry of the minority but it was; Because this action has had a single way, it became similar to the name, so he took his own character, which is the minority, our saying: There is no doubt that the verb is what it is, what is it.Al -Mahaitan: Either they are contradictory, or they are not opponents, if they are opponents, they are impossible to meet them in all the places, so we are in all the places, so we are.That this is not a verb, and if there are no two opponents, the validity of the miniature is required to all the verbs, and when this is not the same as our knowledge.The eighth pilgrimage: the correction of this word and the heroes of its affiliation, so you say in the admiration: what is more destroyed by the correction of the waw as long as it is, as it is.If it was a verb, it would be a thousand for the opening of what was before it, you would not see them saying: He resided residing, then it was said: This is the word, when it is necessary With the name of the name, and the decree is that the transmission in the verbs was not perhaps the cause of it as a verb, nor the correction in the names of the cause When a lot of expatriates, and the numbers of the names in the name of the expatriate, and this action with the house of the name in the cause of correction and the abuse of the one who is in the cause The actions of the request of lightness, so he would have made a light and then leaves his light, for this is close to the mind.The ninth pilgrimage: that your saying: “Well,” if it was a verb, and your saying: Today, the servant of God, and the phenomenon of the phenomenon that this is not permissible, so what you went to.The argument is the tenth: that the matter was if it was what you mentioned, it would not be that it is permissible to admire every action, and it was more or more, or more, and it is three or more, and it is three or more, and it is three or more, It is permissible only from the trio of the trio, which is the corruption of this saying.And the Basris took the best in our saying, what is good for more, the verb with its face He is the one who is about it.And the second: that the best of the last is the best, and if it was a name, he would have to benefit if it was a news to start.And the third of it: the evidence is on the verge of the connection of the stipulated in it, and it is your saying: what is good.The answer to the first: that it is good as it may be action, so it may also be a name, when it is a word of preference It is not permissible to be action, and you did not ask us except for the same.The answer to the second: We will remember the cause in the obligation of the conquest of the last of this word.“ The actual, if you leave that guide, that you leave this weakness, then this is the total of speech in this saying.The second saying: It is the choice of the lighter, he said: The measure is to make the masculine after the word (what), and it is your saying: This is also weak; For the most mentioned faces; From it, if you said: The one who has good is no more, it is not in the words, and you said: What is good is the best of the words, as well as the saying in the rest of the face.The third saying: It is the choice of the frequency: that the word (what) is for the confession and the most deed of the name, and it is for the preference, as your saying: more than the best of the age of the age of it It is angry under the denial that something is better than him, as he says whoever informs about the knowledge of a person, so he denies it otherwise, and he says this is the one who knows: Showing him what he claims to be dismissed on the dispute of the truth, and that the evidence of evidence can not be established on him and his creek appears in that when you are required to do so.It is better, even if it is not to be a light, as it is in your saying: What is good is more than if you are more important to the best of its members, except that it is a good.The understanding and between this, because there is the meaning of your saying: what is good for more, that is, a member of the good is good, and in this it is with any thing of the glory of the world, and from the goodness of the world, A separation as it is seen, and the disagreement of the movements is a symptom of the significance of disagreement The suffering, and the monument, our saying is also more for the difference; Because there is a failure; Because it was added to the best to it, and we are erecting here for the difference, and also in all the preference of the meaning Your saying: Zourt is a more knowledgeable from Omar, that a good age is a lifetime in science, so this meaning was made, anxious at the need to the difference.The righteous saying: It is also the saying of some of the Kufi, he said: (What) is for the confession and the best of the verb, as the Basris say, it is: You are inferred by this good deeds on the actions of this good, then you say: My mind does not surround his being like his fullness, so you ask that you will be like that What was said in this section.As for the fulfillment of the words in doing it, we will remember it, if God wills in his saying: Hear with them and see [Maryam: 38].
