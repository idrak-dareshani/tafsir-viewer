The researcher is the Almighty: The origin of the night is said: the emergence of origin, then it is: arriving, and the creation of events, so everything that has happened [is the one who is an emerging], then it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a young woman] The feminine has an emerging, if you know this, then we say in the arrival saying: One of them is that it is a phrase for the night hours.The second: It is a expressive of things that happen in the night hours.As for the first saying, Abu Ubaidah said: The night of the night is the hours of its successive and the disturbing.Then those who say this saying, they disagreed, and for those who said: The night is a young person, the son of my son narrated Malika.The whole night is an arrival.And the adulterers of the crossings, may God be pleased with him, said: The origin of the night is between the strangers to dinner, and it is the saying of Said ibn Jabir, the laughter and the sake, and they said: From which the night starts.The second saying: It is the interpretation of the affairs with matters that occur in the night, and they mentioned this saying: With the night that arises from its struggle to worship, that is, it gets up and raises, from the rack of the clouds if it increases.And the second: the arrival of the night, a reflection of the night after the sleep, the son of the Arabs said if you grow from the first night, then you will rise up, then you will take the ritual.And I have a third aspect in it: that if a person is accepted for worship and remembrance in the dark night in the dark house in a place that does not become a ward The delicacy of the heart, then the heart is accepted on the spiritual and divine thoughts, and the day is the senses, the senses are occupied by So the soul is occupied by the senses, so do not empty the spiritual lumps.Which reveals the injustice of the night in the heart of the emptiness of the senses, and the name of the night; Because it does not happen except in the night because of the stagnant obsessions of the same in the night, and it is busy in the day, and it was not mentioned that those things are from the thyroid Reconciliations, lights and revelations, and an exclusive reactions from the paths of the world of sanctification or fear from it, or the imagination of the loudspeakers, so that it was the same Many gender is not collected by a group, except that they are acute and no generous things that are not a crime that they only described as the night of the night.* * As for his saying, the Exalted: It is the most intense, upright, and equivalent, and it is a source that is said: I slow down so -and -so on such a collision and a woman, and from it to the one who is the same [Al -Taibah: 37] That is: to agree, then if we are pleased with the watches, the meaning was that it is more agreed upon by what is intended from the roughness and the salvation, and if we were pleased with it, then we were pleased with it.The meaning is the intensity of the surroundings between the heart and the tongue, and if we were pleased with the rise of the night, the meaning was what is intended from the fear and the salvation, and if we were pleased with what is the meaning of the meaning of the meant To the collection of disclosures in the night is more severe than it in the day, and from the good is more attached between the secret and the global; To cut off the vision of the vitils.The second question: Reading “is more severe” by opening and breaking in it and in it.Because (P-156) the day is forced in it people and flipping in it for pension.And the second: I was sacked and thickened by the prayer of the prayer of the day, and it is one of your saying: You are tightened on the people and the abundance of their authority, if they are less than them, and in them, and in the hadith, and in them: And you stoke on a harmful one.Her holes, "meaning it is her hardship.And the choice of Abu Ubaidah the first reader, he said: Because he was upset when he commanded him to do the night, he mentioned this verse, as he said: I commanded you to pray.Because the agreement of the heart and the tongue is more complete, and also the nights of the night to the spiritual disclosures.* * His Excellency said: And I have a saying in which there are two questions: The voices are cut in it and the words are made, and it is not without hearing and understanding it.The second question: Ansa was read and said: "He said to him: O Abu Hamza, but it is: and the residency of a rhetoric, and Anas said: And the one who said: On that the people were considering the suffering, then if they found it, they did not stop the righteousness, and his counterpart is what was narrated that Abu Swar al -Ghanawi was reading: However, the slander, so he said to him: He is a folded, so he said: I feel and one, one, I say: It is necessary to carry this on that, but it is mentioned that the Qur’an is not.He made it the same Qur’an; If we did not go to what Ibn Jini said, the accommodation would benefit from the Holy Qur’an, and we were permitted that every one crossed the meaning of the word, for the sake Perhaps it was struck in that belief, and perhaps he made a mistake, and this is running to the stabbing in the Qur’an, so you have proven that he carried that on what we mentioned.
