The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: O you who believe, do not say our shepherd and say that we looked and heard, and for the disbelievers, a torment, I know that God is up to God.The resurrection of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, he wanted from here to explain the openings of their actions when the Muhammad’s resurrection ﷺ and their grandfather and their diligence in the righteousness in it His religion, and this is the first type of this chapter, and we are: the first question: I know that God Almighty has addressed the believers with his saying: O God Place of the Qur’an.Ibn Abbas said: And he was addressed in the teeth by saying: “O poor people”, as if he was his pursuit of him and the Almighty when he addressed them first with the poor, he said: The humiliation and the domesticated (P-203) [Al-Baqarah: 61].This indicates that he is up to this nation with faith first, for it is the highest that gives them safety from the torment in the fire on the Day of Resurrection, and the name is the name He addresses us in the world with the honor of names and adjectives, so we hope that he is treated in the hereafter with the best of the customers.The second question: that it is no longer in the two sympathetic words to prevent God from one of them, and it is permissible in the last, and that is for that The prayer is reconciled with the hypocrisy of the conqueror, whether it was with the transit or the Parisiyah, so it is not far from God to prevent God from his saying: He is the one who said: They were two symposiums, but the prevailing of those who are up to be exalted, but he was forbidden from his saying: He sponsored us to disobey her on the types of spoils, then they are the same, then they are.The Muslims used to say to the Messenger of God ﷺ if they read anything from them: our shepherd, O Messenger of God, and the Jews were for them a word of the words This word, and it is “our shepherd”, and its meanings: hear, not heard, and when they heard the believers say: Our shepherds, they were supposed to him and add to him the Prophet, and they are the one, and they are the one, and they are the one, and they are the one, and they are the one, and they are the one, The believers about it and commanded another word, which is his saying: Look at us, and it is indicated by the validity of this interpretation of the saying of the Almighty in the surah of the women: It is not heard, and he sponsored us with their tongues and stabbed in religion [Women: 46], and it was narrated that Saad ibn Muhah heard it from them, so he said: O God of God, to you, and for you With his hand, if I heard her from a man from you, he says to the Messenger of God to be harmed by his neck, so they said: You are what you say?This verse was revealed.And the second: Qatarb said: This word, even if it is the authenticity of the meaning, except that the people of the Hijaz did not say it except when the mock and the sarcasm, so it is not the end of it.And the third: That the Jews were saying: our shepherd, meaning: you are the shepherd of our sheep, so God made them about them.And its booster: that his saying: “Our shepherd” is a reactor from the shepherd between two, so this memorization was delusional to the equality between the addressees, as if they said: Our hearing, and God Almighty has come to them, and he showed that there must be the greatness of the Messenger, peace be upon him, in the addressee of what he said: Do not make the supplication of the Messenger of you 63].Fifth: that his saying: “Our shepherd” is a speech with the recovery, as if he says: He is a sponsor of my words and do not be afraid of him, and do not occupy it, and he does not.As if they said to him standing in your words and pyramids, what we reach his understanding.And its sixth: that his saying: “Our shepherd” is on the weight of our unemployed, and we have gone out of the symbolism.It is foolish, for the shepherd is an active name of pillow, so it is preserved that they wanted the source.As they said: “Hallows of you, that is, I seek refuge in you, and their saying:“ I mean, you did a pill.And it is enticed that they wanted it: you became a sponsor, that is, you became a pious, and when they intended this corrupt face, there is no crime, God forbids this word.And the seven of it: that the intention is not to say a shepherd, that is: a generous saying to the shepherd, with a sponsor: a fatter and a son.As for his saying, the Exalted: And say that we looked at him, and it is a face: one of them: that it is from his “look”, meaning: wait for it, he said: “Look at us, we will follow from your light:” Al -Hadid: They ask him to say about it, so they do not need to be used.If it was said: Was the Prophet ﷺ accelerated upon them until they say this?The answer is from two sides: one of them: that this is a word that is said in the words of the words, and if there is no hurry that is married to that as the saying of the man in the man: You heard.The second: that they were pleased with his saying: Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it [the resurrection: 16] that - peace be upon him - he was hurrying the saying of what he prays - Checking the sake of the revelation and taking the Qur’an, so he said to him: “No (P-204), move with it for your tongue to be hurried with it”, so do not go away from it.The matter of religion is keen on the miracle of their understanding, so they asked him in this case to qualify them as he addresses them until they understand all of that words.And the second: “Look at us,” with it: Look at us, except that he deleted a letter ”to“ as in his saying: and the choice of Moses his people [Al -A'raf: 155] and the meaning: from the one who is from the people, and the one who is from the one who is from the people, and the meaning: If he looked at the learner, his revenue for the words of the understanding and the awareness appeared and stronger.And the third of it: Abi Bin Kaab read: “See us” from the theory, that is:: Mother.As for the saying of the Almighty: They heard, and the hearing is made at the peace of the sensual matter that is a harmful matter that is outside the ability Three matters: one of them: empty your hearing for what the Prophet says - peace be upon him - so that you do not need to be restored.And the second: Hear the hearing of acceptance and obedience, and your hearing was not heard of Jews, where they said: He heard and disobeyed us.And the third of it: Hear what you have commanded until you do not return to what you have forbidden to confirm them, and then he is up to the disbelievers of the disbelievers, for the disbelievers, if the disbelievers are the one who does not.The Messenger is this way of greatness, tubes, and listening to what he says and thinking about what he says, and the meaning of “the painful torment” may be presented.
