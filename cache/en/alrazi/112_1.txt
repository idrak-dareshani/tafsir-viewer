The Quranic researcher (P-1660) (Surah Al-Khalas).Four verses, angels.﷽ Say: God is one.﷽ Say: God is one of the rituals in the interpretation, it is imperative that it is possible to be a chapter: the first chapter: narrated Abi, he said: The Messenger of God said: As if the third of the Qur’an read and was given the ten years of good deeds with a number of those who have been blessed with God and believed in God.I am given the reward as those who believe in God and his angels and his books and his messengers, and I have been given from the reward like a hundred martyrs.The prayers and peace be upon him, when the father of the Ghaffari was accepted, and Jabril said: This is the father of Dura, who was accepted.With you, the prayers and peace be upon him: What did he have this guidance?So the sun got up to what the beams have a ray and what we saw on that situation, just before that, so we liked all of us, so Jabril was revealed and said: God is a matter of God.A thousand king, and they will reach Muawiyah ibn Muawiya, so may you pray to him?Then he was beaten by his land, and he removed the mountains, and the Messenger became upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, as if he was honored by him, and he and his companions were upon him, then he said: Jabriel said: He loved the surah of the salvation.He has a sufficiency for him, so he said: He forgive you, forgive you, for you three times.Your house is a peace if it is in it one of it, and if there is no one in it, then he will be peaceful, and read it to God, one of the times, so he did the man, so he did the man, so the man did the man, and the man did the man, and the man did, and the man did, and the man did the man, and the man did the man, and the man did the man, and the man did the man, and the man did.Until he elaborated on his neighbors, “and on the authority of Anas:“ A man used to read in all his prayers: (P-161) Say: He is God, so the Messenger asked him about that, and he said: “O God,” He said: Your love for it will bring you paradise.The second chapter: In the reason for its descent and in it, it is the first: the first: that it came down by the question of the participants.And they said: You have shocked our disaster and caused our gods, and you are immortalized by the religion of your fathers, if you are a poor wealth, and if you are crazy, you will not be, and if you are, then you will have it.May God’s prayers and peace be upon him: I am not a poor, nor a madman, and no I am a woman, I am the Messenger of God.So God, this surah, said to him: Three and Siton are a word that does not do our wounds, so how does the one perform the sacrifices of creation?So she went down: Al -Saffat [Al -Saffat: 1] to his saying: Your God is for the one [Al -Saffat: 4] So send him the last, and they said: Show us to his actions, and he descended: And the earth [Yunus ": 3].Muhammad, this God created the creation, so who created God?So the Prophet of God, peace be upon him, was angry, and Jabriel sent him, and he drew it, and he said: Raise your wings, Muhammad How to support it, how is his arm?So he was more angry than his first anger, and Jabriel brought him with his saying: And what God has destroyed the right of his destiny.”[Al -Anam: 91].Ibn Abbas, he said: “The ransom of the redemption of Najran, so they said: Clear to us, your Lord, the security of Zabraj, or sapphire, or gold, or a silver?He said: My Lord is not from anything because he is the creator of things, so I went down: Say: God is one of the one who said: He is one of the one Al -Samad said: What is the steadfast?And he said: The one who sets to the creation in the neighborhood, so they said: We increased and he went down: He did not give birth as Maryam was born: and he was not born as he was born to Jesus: and he did not A counterpart from his creation.” And the second: the wall of al -Tarjid.And because whoever believes it was clear in the debt of God, and because whoever died on him was his salvation from the fire.And between my father, and the fifth: God; and because God has known this face, then he is a mercy.To ask who said: We have your Lord, and because peace be upon him, he said to a man from the children of Silim: Because when they said: Your Lord is given to us, so he said: The proportions of God and the preservation of the lineage from the Arabs of the Arabs, and they were tightening on the one who increases, The proportion of God in this surah is the first to preserve it.And eighth: The Surah of the Knowledge is that the knowledge of God does not fulfill except with the knowledge of this surah, “Jabir narrated that a man prayed and read: He said: And peace: This is a servant who knows his Lord, "So the sigra is called for that.And the ninth: The wall of camels said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: Because if it is not one of the aides, it is permissible for that example to be repentant.And her adore: the wall of the scratch, it is said: the sickness is discussed from what is in it, so whoever knows this is the innocence of the evil and the hypocrisy, because the hypocrisy is the one who said: Med soil [Al -Baqarah: 10].The one twenty: Al -Muwadah, “It was narrated that peace be upon him, he entered Utmann ibn Muzamun, and he did it with it and the two of them, then he said:“ Then he said: “Then he said:” I was well -known from them.The second is ten: Surah Al -Samad; Because it is a specialty with its male.The third is the same: the foundation of the basis, the prayer and peace be upon him said: To try the heavens and the earth with the evidence of its saying: the heavens almost break it from it, and the land inhale the land and the mountains of the mountains [Maryam: 90], so it is obligatory to be the same These are the things and the reason was said in it the meaning of the Almighty saying: If there were deities except God, they would spoil [Al -Anbiya: 22].The fourth is the tenth: The Surah of the Mana’a “Ibn Abbas narrated that he was the highest.The torment of the grave and the flames of the fire.The fifteenth: the prepared wall, because the angels are preparing to recover it if it is read.The sixth: the alienation because the Satan is alienated with its readers.The four -fourth: The bright because he was “narrated that peace be upon him.Surah “Say: God is one of the hundred times in a prayer or otherwise, it was written for him with lights from the fire.” The eighth is ten: the surah of the remembrance is because it reminds the servant, the pure of al -Tuhidah, so the liability of the surah is like the name that reminds you of what you want from it.The ninth is the tenth: the surah of the light.God Almighty said: God is the light of the heavens and the earth [Al -Nur: 35] So it is the light for the heavens and the earth, and the surah is enlightened by your heart and said: Everything has a light, and the light of the Qur’an say that God is one.The twenty: The wall of safety, peace be upon him, said: “If the servant says, there is no god but God, he entered my fortress and whoever entered my fortress from my torment.” The loyal chapter: In the virtue of this surah and it is from the faces: the first: it was purified in the hadiths that the readings of this surah adjusts the readers of the third of the Qur’an The honorable one of the whole of the parties and worship, the knowledge of God and the knowledge of his attributes and the knowledge of his verbs, and this surah is a disgrace to the knowledge of this The surah is equivalent to the third of the Qur’an, and Surra: Say, O infidels [the disbelievers: 1], it is equivalent to the four Quran; Because the intended of the Qur’an is either the verb or the blessing and each of them is either in the actions of the hearts, or in the actions of the wounds, the divisions are four, and the slope of the For what he is overwhelmed by the reactions of the hearts, it was in the truth that was covered by a quarter of the Qur’an, and from this reason, the two surahs were bought, I mean: God is one in some of the names, as they are the two and the innocent, from where each one of them is beneficial to the righteousness With the memorial of the brightness, what is only God and the mandate of the preoccupation with God, and say, God is one of the benefit of his words, the preoccupation with God, and the symptom of the symptoms, or the symptoms of God الكافِرُونَ تُفِيدُ بَراءَةَ القَلْبِ عَنْ سائِرِ المَعْبُودِينَ سِوى اللَّهِ, وقُلْ هو اللَّهُ أحَدٌ تُفِيدُ بَراءَةَ المَعْبُودِ عَنْ (p-163)كُلِّ ما لا يَلِيقُ بِهِ.The second direction: that the night of the destiny for her to be a honesty for the Qur’an was a good one of a thousand months, for the Qur’an is all.It is this guidance.The third face: which is that the mental evidence indicates that the greatest of the servants of the servant is that his heart is enlightened by the light of the majesty of God and his arrogance The surah, so this surah was the greatest of the light, because it was said: the descriptions of God are also mentioned in the path Because of its minimum in the image, it remains entrusted with the hearts, known to the minds, so the male of the majesty of God is never present in this reason, so there is no generosity With this virtue, and it is now referring to interpretation.His exalted say: Say: God is one of the books: The first question: Know that the knowledge of God is the Heaven of Heaven present, as Heaven is that you will get what is agreed Paradise was not a paradise for Adam, when it was disputed His mind is his passion, and the grave was not a prisoner of the believer because he has obtained for him there, there is nothing that is perfect Paradise is divorced, and the two people said: The mind wants a faithful mother who is deposited with good deeds, and the desire wants a rich person who is required of the lords, but the mind is like the mind.It is high, so it is only criticized for its money, and the passion is like the result, which if he hears the presence of a rich, then he is active to resort to it, but the mind is not.The Mawli will thank him for the past and the passion he asks for him to reassure him in the arrogant blessings, so when he recognized him as he wanted him a scholar and rich, he is a richness, so he was a matter Thank you, one of you, and the lust said: I do not ask anyone but you, then the suspicion came and said: O mind, how did I repeat it with the thank you?What a lust, how did you confine to it, and perhaps there is another door?So the mind remained confused and disobeyed that comfort, so he wanted to travel in the world of the recipient to win the journey of the jurisprudence, so he said: I am discredicized on my servant, the pleasure of preoccupation with my servants and my thanks?So God sent his Messenger and said: Do not say it from your soul, but say he is the one who introduced him to my sincerely, he says to me: Say: God is one of you, so he knows the wahid.The view and the reason for the mind, and its achievement that the demands for three sections, a section of which cannot be reached by the hearing, which is all that is the right His authenticity is like the knowledge of God, the Almighty, his knowledge, his ability, and the authenticity of miracles, and an oath of which is not possible to reach it except with the hearing, and it is the same, which is the same, which is the same, which is the same Its fall, and a third section that can reach it with the mind and hearing together, and it is like the knowledge that it is one and that it is visible to them, and it is in our way Humanism in the interpretation of his Almighty saying: If there were gods except God, they would spoil.The second question: Know that they were gathered on the fact that it is necessary in Surah: Say: O you who disbelieved from “say” and gather on that it is not permissible to say: “Say” The Surah has disagreed, for the famous rulers: Say: God is one and read my father and the son of Masoud, without “say” so: (He is one of the people) This is how: (God is one of God, the silence).That was not known to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.The third question: Know that in the expression of this verse is a face: one of them: that it is a sequence of the name of God, so it is his saying: God is a high It is a beginner news, and it is permissible in his saying: (One) is what is permissible in your saying: your brother's increasing is a standing.The second: that (P-164) is a severity of the affair, and on this report, God will be beneficial to the appetite The hadith is that God is one, and his counterpart is his saying: If it is a thief, the eyes of those who disbelieve [the prophets: 97] except that it came on the ethnic; Because in interpretation: a feminine name, and on this it came: it does not mourn the sight [Hajj: 46] but if it is not in the interpretation it is feminine, it is not feminine.His Lord comes as a crime [Taha: 74].The third: Al -Zajaj said: The estimation of this verse is that this is the one that you asked about it is God.The following question: in (one) and Jahan: one of them: that it is one meaning, the Khalil said: It is permissible to say: one of the two and the origin of one is the only one, except that it is the heart of the wow.And more of what they do, this is the wow of the guaranteed and broken, as their saying: it is faced, wages, corruption and corruption.And the second saying: that the one and the one are not two convergers.A single with it, but one of the attributes of God, the Almighty, was influenced by it, so it does not share anything in it, then they mentioned in the difference between the one and the one who is one of the one: One does not enter it.And the second: that if you say: so that it is not the same as one, it is permissible to say: but it will take him two by one with the difference of one, for if you said: So, so that he will not be fulfilled.Two are taken by two.And the third: that the one is used in the evidence, and one in the negation, you say in the evidence I have seen one man, and say in the negation: I have not seen anyone, so I will help the uncle.The fifth question: The readers differed in his saying: (One of God, the silence).This is because the dedication is one of the “one” is a living and the knowledge of God is a dwelling, and when you are left, the first of them is your first one of them with the fraction, and on the authority of Abu Omar, “ The noun was marred by the letters of Lin that it is increasing as they were more, and when it was young, it was done, its course was done in the fact that it was dwelt for the meeting of the sins, as the one who was omit Nahu: The people are invaded and the people invaded, and the people are threw up, and this is the deleted noun in the verb, we are: (I did not) It was deleted in “one of God” for the meeting of the two people, as these forests were deleted.We mentioned this in detail at his saying: Azzir, the son of God [Al -Tawbah: 30] and also narrated from Abu Omar: (One of God) and he said: I realized the readers, so they read it, as well The way our Lord [Al -Ahzab: 67] and what you realize what is a fire [Al -Qarbah: 10], so (one of God), when the most readers were when Abu Amr told him about Al -Waqif, I will see him To continue to stand on him and his abundance in their tongue, and read the blind: (Say: God is the one), then it was said: Why?It was said: One of the denials, Al -Mudardi said: It is in it.The second: that what is meant is denial on the way to glorify.The sixth question: Know that his saying: (He is one of the three and every one of them is a sign of a denomination of the positions of the students: the first place: the place Those who are the ones who are the ones who looked at what are the things and their entitlements from where they are, so they did not see what they have seen, and only God is because the truth is the one who is the truth (P-165) It is obligatory and his existence, and as for what he promised, he is able to himself and the subject of his own if he looks at him from where he is he was a mantle, so he did not see the right.Glory be to him, and his saying: (He) is a divorced reference and the sign, even if it is divorced, except that the referred to it, when it was appointed, was the one who is divorced, so that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was given to the one was not.Our saying: “It is a sign of these approaches to the right, and they did not come to the right to a distinction; Because the intercession is to the distinction, but it is obtained when there are two stages, and we have indicated that these are what they witnessed with the eyes of their minds, except for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, but the one who is the one who was For the memorial: The second place: It is the place of the companions of the right, and it is without the first place, and that is because these are the right to the truth and they witnessed the creation as well There is no crime, it was not sufficient in the sign of the truth, but there must be there from a distinction in it that the truth is distinguished from creation: so they needed that they are the same.It was said to them: He is God, because God is the supply that is limited to what he promised, and he seeks me from all that I have prepared.The third place: It is the place of the people of the north, and it is the most miserable of the positions, and they are those who permit that it is more and more obligatory.One of what was presented as a response to these and heroes for their articles was said: Say: God is one.وهَهُنا بَحْثٌ آخَرُ أشْرَفُ وأعْلى مِمّا ذَكَرْناهُ وهو أنَّ صِفاتِ اللَّهِ تَعالى إمّا أنْ تَكُونَ إضافِيَّةً وإمّا أنْ تَكُونَ سَلْبِيَّةً, أمّا الإضافِيَّةُ So our saying: a scholar, a fierce, creative, ethnic, and the robe is our saying: It is not a body, nor a vulnerability, nor an offer, and the creatures are the first of the first.Secondly, on the second type of it, and our saying: God indicates the gathering of additional attributes, and our saying: One is a sign of the gathering of the ritual attributes, so we said: Completely in the statement of the karan that is appropriate for the human minds, but we said: God's memorization indicates the addition of additional attributes; And that is because God is the one who deserves worship, and the fulfillment of worship is only for those who are prejudiced by finding and creativity, and in addition to finding nothing Supported with the complete ability, the exact and knowledge related to all the information from the colleges and parties, and this is the gathering of additional attributes The negative is the limit, and that is because what is meant is from the limit, as the fact that the truth in itself is a uniqueness that is out of the parts of the installation, and that is what is for all of you A compound, it is extracted to every one of its parts, and every one of its parts is other than it, so every crown For itself, every compound is that it is possible for itself, for the god who is the principle of all the women is forbidden to be possible, so it is in the soul of the soul, then it is the same It should not be a bite; Because every bias is a bit, then it is a good manner for his path, and everything that was like that is divided, so one is impossible to be a bias.It is in anything from the bias and flaws, and it must not be immediately in anything; Because it is with his place, it is not one, and it is not a place for something; Because it is not one, and if it is not a case or a place, it is not a deceitful deception, because the change is inevitable and that it is from a row to a row, and if it is a row, if it is It will be one, if it was imposed, and the existence of the existence of the existence of the bought in the garment, and the muma in the time, and what the shame is not in what is in the man She proves that one of it is one of the one that is one of it.From that limit and their group, then that third is three, not anyone.Answer: The limit is necessary for that fact, so the ruler of it is the one that is the truth, not the group that takes place from it and that of the one who is the one who is the one who is in the His saying: (God is one), as the words are included in all the attributes of God, the Almighty from the additions and the spectacles, and the completeness of the words in this section is mentioned in the interpretation of the saying of God: 163].
