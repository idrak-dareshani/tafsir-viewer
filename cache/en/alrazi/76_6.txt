The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: a eyes with which the worshipers of God drink in it: the first question: We said: the camphor is the name of the river - it was “eyes”, and it is from it, and if you did not And appreciation: I mean.As for our saying: The camphor is a name for this thing called the camphor -it was “eyes” instead of a place ”from the same as“ on the estimation of an added omitting, as if it is a matter Eye, then the additive was deleted, and the added of his place was evaluated.The second question: He said in the first verse: They drink from a bad and he said here: He drinks with it, so he remembers there “from“ and we are the Ba, and the difference is that the good is the beginning of the beginning.As for the eye, they mix their drink, as if the meaning: the servants of God drink with it the wine, as it says: I drank the water with honey.(P-214) The third question: His saying: He drinks the servants of God in general, so it is beneficial that all the worshipers of God drink from them, and the infidels are with the agreement that they do not The worshipers of God are not kept in the people of faith.So the estimation of the verse becomes: He does not satisfy his faithful worshipers, so the verse does not indicate that he does not want the infidelity of the infidel.His Excellency said: They explode it with a triggered, which is devoid of it, where they will, where they will, from their homes, are easy to leave, and it is not a reason for them, The righteous in the hereafter, explained their business that they have been answered by that In it, enough, as for the vow, the father of a Muslim said: The vow is like the promise, except that if it is from worshipers, then it is a vow, and if it is from God, he is up to God He says: God is upon me and such and such from charity, or he is suspended by an issue that he touches from God Almighty, for example, he says: If God is satisfied, he is my satisfaction And they differed as if it was suspended by what is not from the face of righteousness, as if he said: If the house of the house enters, then do so, so from the people who made it as the one who made it, and from them, whoever makes it as a matter This is a saying: For those who interpret the interpretation of the verse, the first: the first: that what is meant by the vow is the vow only, then the deaf said: This is a way in the way of the fun Details.Because those who fulfilled what he answered is on himself, he was what God had to do with him, and this interpretation is in the end of goodness.And the second: What is meant by the warning is all that is required of it, whether it is necessary to positively, God Almighty, or by the fact that the cost of it is the same as the same And that is because the vow is with it Positive.And the third of it: Al -Kalbi said: What is meant from the vow is the covenant and the belief, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: and they fulfilled my covenant, and I will fulfill your covenant.They fulfilled the contracts [Al -Mawdida: 1] named it for contracts because they held them on themselves with their beliefs.The second question: This verse is indicative of the path of exile with the warning; Because he is the Almighty, they are afraid of a day, and this requires that they fulfilled the warning of fear of the evil of that day, and the fear of the evil of that day is not the day.He answered, and this is confirmed by the words of the Almighty: Do not pass the days after its confirmation [Al -Nael: 91], and by saying it: Then they will spend it, and they will be fulfilled.[29] So he will be entitled: to fulfill the work of their holding, which they have to do with themselves.The third question: Al -Farah and a group of the suffering of the suffering said: “It was“ in his saying that its mood was an increased caravan.As for here, “it was“ deleted, and the estimation: they would have gone through the warning.And it is a saying that he said: We have indicated that “in his saying: It was not an outrageous mood, and in this verse, there is no need to add to it, and that is because it is the same They drink which they will drink, for the conservation of the horrific is shared between the situation and the righteousness, then he said: The reason for that reward that will find it is that they are now.
