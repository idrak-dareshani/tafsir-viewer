The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: If you spend your suffering, remember God, as your fathers are your fathers or more remembrance; In it: The first question: Ibn Abbas narrated that the Arabs were at the emptiness of their Hajj after the days of the tribute, and they stood between the mosque, And each one of them remembers the virtues of his fathers in the aftermath and the hammer and the mercy The verb is the fact that the month and the raising of the effects of his predecessor, so when God blessed them with Islam, their matter is that their remembrance of their Lord is like a remembrance of their Lord.The lock narrated in his “interpretation” on the authority of Ibn Omar, who said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ on his bronchy gave him the day of the day And upon him, then he said: “As for after, O people, God has gone away from you, the ignorance and disintegration of the ignorance, O people, but people are men; A righteous righteousness is a generous for God, or a fabrication of a pure one to God, and then you, O people, we have created you from the remembrance and the female [the stone: 13], I say this is the saying of this And for you and to you, “And on the authority of Al -Saddi that the Arabs are after their emptiness from the pilgrimage, one of them was saying: Oh God, my father was the great of the eyelid, the greatness I gave it, so God Almighty revealed this verse.* * * (P-157) The first said: “So they spent seven heavens on two days [you separated: 12], and if the prayer is spent and said the prayer and peace be upon him: The conclusion of the specialty spent between them.And the counterpart of the second saying is the Almighty: your Lord was spent [Al -Asra: 23] and if he is used in the media, then what is meant is also that as saying: He spent us to the children of Israel in the book: If this is proven, then he says: His Excellency said: If you make up your suffering, only the void of all of it will be spent from all of it.It is permissible for the meant to be: Remember God with your prayers, and the meant is from this remembrance what they commanded from the supplication with the definitions, the poetry, the forbidden, His saying: If you spent your suffering, remember God as saying the saying: If you argue, then stop, and stand with a definition, and do not mean that the void is the one who does not say, and this is the one who does not.Weak; Because we have shown that his saying: If you make up for your suffering, you feel emptied and perfect from all, and this is a difference of the saying of the saying: If you do not see it, then it is a lap Entry in Hajj, not emptiness, and this is not permissible That what is meant is only the emptiness of the pilgrimage.* * * The third issue: Who is the position of worship, the estimation was: if you spend your work, then it will be from the door of the addition of the added.If you know this, then he said: Some of the interpreters said: What is meant by your insults is what God has commanded, the people of the pilgrimage in the pilgrimage from the worship, and from the Mujahid that the elimination The following question: Fulfillment in his saying: Remember God indicates that emptiness from your insults is required this remembrance, so if this is the same as this remembrance, that is, what is the remembrance of any remembrance?Some of them are those who carried it on the remembrance of the sacrifice, and among them is those who carried it on the remembrance that is the proud after the prayer on the day of the sacrifice and the days First and last; Because after the emptiness of the pilgrimage, there is no special remembrance, except for this greatness, and among them is those who said: Rather, what is meant is that the people are met with what they are used to from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Parents; Because it is up to him, if it was not forbidden for that by removing this verse, they would not be to change from this wretched way, so if he said: So, he said: And you analyzed, so they would be forgiven by the remembrance of God without the remembrance of the fathers, and among them who said: Rather, it is intended from it that the emptiness of the pilgrimage is obligatory to accept the supplication, and for the sake The parties of the people and the custody, the agreement of the money, and the commitment to the hardships in the travel of Hajj, and the right to it after the emptiness from it to be accepted by supplication and the burden, and the abundance God is exalted, and on this year, the Sunnah was ran after the emptiness of the prayer with many calls.And in it a fifth aspect: that the intended of the preoccupation with this worship: the soul of the soul and the surroundings of the effects of the soul and the patience, then this determination is not the same.It is intended for it to go away from the soul of the soul, until the light of the majesty of God, and the opposite, will be evacuated in it.And I took the harm from the way of Silkuk, and they were occupied after that by turning the heart with the remembrance of God, for the first is a negation, and the second is proof, and the first is to remove what is the right The heart of the heart with the remembrance of the king is mighty.* * * (P-158) As for his words, the Almighty: Your fathers are your fathers, in his face and face They are in praise of their fathers in the remembrance of their consequences and their virtues, so God said: Glory be to Him As you were You are wrapped in the remembrance of the fathers, and they made your effort in praise for God, and the explanation of his gods and his gospels, as you made your effort to praise your fathers; Because this is the first and close to the mind of praise for the fathers, then the remembrance of the fathers of the fathers if it is a lie, then this is obligatory in the world and the mind in the last It is obligatory to be wonder, arrogance, and many fools, and all of the mothers of the sacrifices, so you have proven that your dedication to the remembrance of God is more than your assumption of your fear, for your absence The first is not less than equal.And the second: Al -Dahhah and Al -Raba’i said: Remember God as your fathers and your mothers, and should be satisfied with the remembrance of the fathers about the mothers as his saying: Sarbil, who will protect you: The boy said the first thing that the words are correct, his father, his mother, his mother, that is, they are persistently on the remembrance of God, as the boy is in his young man, and the father of his father.And the third of it: The father of a Muslim said: The remembrance of the fathers of the fathers of the remembrance of the remembrance, and the meaning is that the man is as he does not forget the remembrance of his father, so it is obligatory to not be overlooked.And its booster: Ibn al -Anbari said in this verse: The Arabs were the most of their sections in the ignorance of the fathers, as his saying: My father, your father, my grandfather, and your grandfather, and he said: Your fathers are glorified.Fifth: Some of the masculinity said: The meaning is reminded of God with al -Huddan, as your fathers remember your fatigue, for the one who is for them to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same From it, then I was proven to the same gods, and he was said to them: Remember God of the Haddani, as your fathers remember your fathers with the guidance, but the one in the way of the There, and this is what is meant by saying: or more remembrance.And its sixth: that the child is as long as it is returned to his father in the request of all the tasks and be a male for him with greatness, so you are in the remembrance of God as well.And the sake of it: it is possible that they were remembered by their fathers, so that they could be seen by their remembrance of the answer to the supplication with God, so God bless them, for their fathers, for their fathers.Their actions of goodness became unprecedented in the cause of their evil, and they are commanded to make the extent of that, the number of God and his blessing, and the goodness of God, and the goodness of God.And a way to the frequency of blessings in the future time, and the Messenger of God ﷺ was forbidden to solve their fathers, and he said: So God is for God and God, for the first is the greatness of God, the Almighty, and there is no otherness.And eighth: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said in the interpretation of this verse: is that you get angry with God if he disobeys more than your anger for your father if he is remembered.And know that this face is, even if it is induced, but the first face is the appointed and all.The faces are shared in one thing, which is that the servant must be always remembered for his Lord, always glorifying him The obedience is upon its fullness, O God, make us with this adjective, O Ekram Al -Akramin.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: or more remembrance, in his two questions: the first question: the worship of the Arabs is the most severe: the kaf, so it will be its position, and it is said: His position is a staple, and the appreciation: Remember God, like your remembrance of your fathers, and mention it, “more remembrance” than your fathers.The second question: its saying: or more remembrance of it: it is more remembered, and that is because the proud of their fathers was a little, but the attributes of the kinship are the best It is permissible, so they must be dedicated to the remembrance of the attributes of the fullness in the right of God (P-159).And the metaphor of the language is like this is known.From it.* * His Excellency said: It is among the people who says our Lord is coming in the world and what he has in the hereafter of creation, and among them is those who say our Lord, our Lord, in the world, good and in the last Those have a share of what they have earned, and God is quick to reckon in the verse.With the remembrance, he said: If you have been removed from the norms, then remember God with the ritual poetry and mention it as he guided you, then show that the first is to be blessed, and that he will be blessed.His remembrance, and he said: So mention God as your fathers, or more remembrance, then between that remembrance, how is the supplication, and he said: Whoever says: This is the best of this path, because it is necessary to provide worship to break the soul and remove its darkness, and then after worship, it is necessary to work with the remembrance of God.And the light of its majesty is evacuated, and then after that remembrance, the man is used by the supplication, for the supplication is complete if it is preceded by the remembrance of the remembrance, as it is the one who is told by the authority of the authority The remembrance came and said: He who created me, so they guided [the poets: 78] Then he said: Lord, grant me wisdom and to me with the righteousness [Al -Shua’ar: 83] If you know this, then say: God Almighty shows that those who call God are two verafts; One of them: that their prayers are defined by the request of the world, and the second: those who collect in the supplication between the request of the world and the request of the last, and it was in the third His prayers are defined by the request of the hereafter, and they have disagreed that this division is this Is it hungry or not?And most of the people are unknown, and that is that the human being is a weak, irritated, and no energy with the pain of the world or the hardships of the hereafter, so the first one is for him The world and the hereafter, the lock narrated in his “interpretation” on the authority of Anas that the Prophet ﷺ “entered a man who returned to him and may have exhausted the sick, and he said: He did not say: He said: I used to say: Oh God, what you were punishing with me in the hereafter, and he accelerated it in the world, so the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Glory be to God, you do not.Do you not say our Lord in the world in good and in the last, good, and we are the torment of the fire.He knew that he would have been given to him, even if the pain was overwhelmed by one in the body, or on the basis of one poetry, and the matter of the matter (P-16) is on the authority of the human being, and it is in the human.God Almighty and for the work of his remembrance, whoever takes advantage of the mercy of the mercy of God, is the Almighty in his first and his obstacle, so I have proven that the rest of the supplication is in the supplication.The verse is a sign of it, where the two sections mentioned, and the most important of this is the third division.* * * The second question: they disagreed that those who have told them that they are insisting in supplication to seek the world of those who are?And a people said: They are the infidels, narrated from Ibn Abbas that the participants were saying if they stop And the forgiveness, and that because they were denying the resurrection and the return, and on the authority of Anas they were saying: We were given the rain and gave us the enemy of the nomadic, so the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who has been The jurisprudence is not created for him in the hereafter, that is, we do not share it with dignity, numbers and rewards.They say: They abandoned us from water, or from what God has given you in the world, asking for the food and the evil, so when their lusts prevailed over them, they are laughing in the world, Others: These are believers, but they ask God for their religion, not the last of them, and their question is from the sentence of sins.The positions, and the honor of the scene, the debris of the world and the presentation of the mortal, are exposed to the question of the sleeping asleep in the hereafter, and it may be said to those who do so, that there is no creation, and there is no creation, and there is no creation in that The actor is a Muslim, as it was narrated in his saying: Those who buy the covenant of God and their faith are a few at a little Whoever takes money with a wow, narrated from the Prophet ﷺ, “God support this religion with sizes that have no creation for them.The hereafter is only repenting.The second: There is no creation for him in the hereafter, except that God forgives him.The third: There is no creation for him in the hereafter as the creation of those who asked God for his last, and therefore there is no creation for those who took money with two years and a fool as the creation of those who have the same.* * * The third question: His exalted say: Our Lord is coming in the world, the act of “came us” from the words because it is like the knowledgeable, and I know that the paths of the people are three Bidniyah, and external.As for the spirituality, it is two: the theoretical power is accomplished by science, and the process of the operational power is with the virtuous ethics, and the urbanism is the one who is true: So two: the money, and the prestige, and its saying: “We come to the world, all of these sections are in charge of the knowledge, then the knowledge is that if it is intended to decorate it in the world and the raising of it, then it is from the world.And the virtuous ethics, if it is intended for the descendants in the world and the connection of its reconciliation was from the world, and everyone who does not believe in the mission and the re -is, then it does not ask for a pharaoh, no Except for the sake of the world, then he said in the right of this jurisprudence: and what he has in the hereafter from the creation of any creation that has no share in the nakedness of the hereafter, and the opposite of this is the one who said: The plow of the hereafter we will increase it in his plow and whoever wants the inheritance of the world as his result from it and what he has in the hereafter from the share [Al -Shura: 20] Then it is the highest of the righteousness of this He asked him in this world, will I answer him or not?Some of them said: The example of this human being is not a family for the answer; Because the fact that the human being is a row of praise, so I only prove to those who have been the guardian of God, who is attached to the dignity, but he did not give it to him.God is a glorification that his livelihood is given to what he said: There is no bear in the earth except God, his sustenance [Hood: 6] and others said: The example of this person may have been, for you will be a good man Be a cultivation and strain.* * * (P-161) As for his words, the Almighty: Some of them say our Lord is our goodness in the world in good and in the last good and we are the torment of the fire, so those who are interpreted are the one who is mentioned in it: Goodness in the world is a expressions of health, security, sufficiency and righteous father, and righteous wife, and victory over the promises, and God has called the Almighty, and the Almighty is the Almighty.He likened it to “good” and he said: If you become good, you will be misfortune [Al -Tawibah: 50] and it was said in his saying: Say: Do you give up with us except for one of the goodness [52] The victory and the testimony, and the good in the hereafter is the winner with the reward, and the salvation of the punishment, and the sentence, its saying: Our Lord has come to the world in the world and in the good All the demands of the world and the other.Hammad ibn Salama narrated on the authority They said to Annas: Call us, and he said: “Oh God, come to us in the world, good, and in the hereafter a good and we are the torment of the fire.” I have asked you for the best of the world and the hereafter.Annas has been sincere, because it is not for the servant a house only the world and the hereafter.And the second: that what is meant by goodness in the world is the beneficial deed, which is faith and obedience, and goodness in the last, permanent and glorious and glorified, and the best of the remembrance of God, and the remembrance of God And with his love and his vision, and the laughter narrated from Ibn Abbas, “A man called his Lord, and he said in his prayers: Our Lord brought us in the world, good The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “What I knew is that this man asked God for something from the matter Well, “The Messenger of God ﷺ said,“ He says: “We are in the world, good deeds”, and this is sure that he said: “And those who say to our Lord say to us The core of the eyes [Al -Faraqan: 74] and that murder is that they see their children and their faces are obedient to those who are believed to be the servants of the servants.The world and in the hereafter the request is required in the two house The world is good and in the last of the good, it was a loyal to all goodness, but he said: In the world in goodness and in the hereafter a good one, and this is a good Well, one, so the advanced ones are different from the beneficiaries.It was said: The goodness came to us in the world and the good in the hereafter, so that was a loyal to all sections, so why did you leave that and remind it of the path of denial?The position - and the knowledge is for God - that we have shown us when you are presented that it is not for my supplicant to say: O God, give me such and such and that, but it is necessary to say: God is that if it is so that it is that: And in line with your judgment and your destiny, then give me that, and if he said: Oh God, give me goodness in the world and the hereafter, then this is a reward, and he has been blessed with us The path of denying, so he said, give me a good deeds, the one who is intended for one is good, and it is the good that will be in accordance with his judgment, his destiny, and his ruling, This is close to the sponsorship of literature and preservation on the basis of the basis of the two.Hope: Those are in it, saying: One of them is: it is a sign of the second jurisprudence at the only one who (P-162).The first is where he said: What he has in the hereafter is created.And the second saying: that it is returned to the two parties, that is, for each of these as a share of his work on the amount of what it has become, so whoever denies the mission and the pilgrimage to the misery of the reward And the evil of God is his rewards, or it is what is meant that those who do the world are given a share like it in its world as he said: Whoever wants the plow of the last of the last He wants the plow of the world, its result from it and what it has in the hereafter from the share [Al -Shura: 20].* * * As for his words, the Almighty: They have a share of what they have caught in the questions: The first question: His saying: They have a share of what they have caused to run the course From it?Answer: What is meant: a share of the world and the hereafter by causing their gain and their work, so he said: “From” in his saying: What they have to do is not.The second question: Does this verse indicate that the penalty is on work?Answer: Yes.But according to the promise, not according to the dhimma.The third question: What is the gain?Answer: Equity is called what the woman gets with his work, so it will be his clothing and his inbully, on the condition that this be a good or a muddy It is said in al -Arbah: It is the gain of so -and -so, and it is a lot of gain or a little gain, because it is only intended for the sacrifice, but the one who says that our companions says that the angel is that Creation is mentioned in the old books in the words.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: God is fasting, in his accounts.المَسْألَةُ الأُولى: سَرِيعُ فاعِلٌ مِنَ السُّرْعَةِ, قالَ ابْنُ السِّكِّيتِ: سَرُعَ يَسْرُعُ سَرْعًا وسُرْعَةً فَهو سَرِيعٌ“والحِسابُ”مَصْدَرٌ كالمُحاسَبَةِ, ومَعْنى الحِسابِ في اللُّغَةِ العَدُّ يُقالُ: Calculating calculating, calculating, and calculating if it is considered, it was mentioned by the one and Ibn al -Sakit, and the calculation is what is considered, and it is according to the man, which is considered to be from the effects, The one who is more than the thing, and Al -Zajaj said: The account in the language is taken from their saying: your account is like that, that is, your palm, so the reckoning of the account in the customs is an account; Because he knows about what is in it, and there is no increase in it in terms of alienation and no shortcomings.The second question: People differed in the sense of the olfactory of God, which is an accountable for his creation on his face Al -Durawiya is created in their hearts with the amounts of their business, their compassion and their contents, and the amounts of their reward and punishment, and they said: and they said: and they said: To collect the knowledge of the human being with what he has and on him, then release the name of the account on this media It will be a release of the name of the cause, and this is a famous metaphor, and we are transferred from Ibn Abbas that he said: It is not an account of the creation, but he will stand And they give their books with their faith in them, in which their bodies are said, and they are said to them: This is your secrets.I put it on you.(P-163) The second saying: The accountant is a phrase for the reward.In it that the account is a reason for taking, giving, and release the name of the cause of the caused, and it is good for the reckoning of the account.And the third saying: It is a condemnation that speaks to worshipers in the conditions of their work and how the reward and punishment have, so whoever said: His words are not a ritual, he said: The author of the cost is hearing that his valuable words hear about him, as he creates a vision in his eyes that he sees as the oldest self, and whoever says: He is a voice that he has said: Every cost is either that this speech creates in the ears of each one of them or in a body that is closer to his ears, where the power of this is not the power of that With it, this is what is meant by his being, an accountability for his creation.The third question: Remember in the sense of its exaltation, the exalted of the account, and its faces: one of them: that his accounting is returned to either that it creates a bitter science With the amounts of his business and the amounts of his reward and his punishment, or that he connects to every cost of what is his right from the reward, or that he creates a hearing in the ears of all The valley, or that it creates in the ears of every cost of a voice indicating the amounts of reward and punishment and on the four faces, then he will return to the fact that it is the same It creates something, and when the ability of God is attached to all the possibilities, and its creation and its events are not stopped on the predecessor, nor the substance, nor the place, nor the place of no On the basis of a crime that was able to create all creation in the least of the optimism of the insight, and this is a unjust words, and for that and he responded in the news that God is the Almighty.And the second: that the meaning of its universe is the Almighty: “The Ra'i al -Hasb” is that it is accepted the acceptance of the supplication of its worshipers and the answer to them, and that is because it is the highest in the one who is the one who asks for the one who asks for the one who asks him Different from the affairs of the world and the hereafter, and every one who is required to be given to him will give him something from that, and if the matter was with one of the two of the two Calculation, God Almighty knows that he is quick to reckon, that is, he is a scholar of the question of the questioners; Because he is not needed A hand of a hand, nor to a thought and a narration, and this is the meaning of the preaching supplication, “Whoever does not occupy a matter of a matter.” And he has the words in this saying that the meaning It is the highest of all the conditions of creation and their work, and the face of the metaphor in it is that the accountant is accountable for the knowledge to him with this So the name of the cause was released.And the third of it: that the accountability of God is fast in the sense of no way.
