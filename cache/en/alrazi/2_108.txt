The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: Or do you want to ask your Messenger, as Moses was asked before and whoever changes the disbelievers with faith, then he has gone astray.The first: “Umm” on two structures: communicated, and interrupted.You say: Will, which is a matter of more or old.“Rather” and the thousand, as the saying of the Arabs: It is the camel, a mother, as if he said: Rather, it is he will, and from it the saying of the Almighty: Umm they say, “The prostration: 3] ؎ I lied to you, or did you see the mediation of the darkness of the ribs, the imagination of the second question: they disagreed with the addressee of it on the face of it: Al -Jaba’i and my father are Muslim, and they inferred from him with his faces: The first: He said at the end of the verse: And whoever reports the disbelief with faith, and this words are only valid in the right of the believers.The second: that his saying: Or do you want to be given to him, and he said: Do not say our shepherd, as if he said: And say: Look and listen to us You are commanded, or do you want to ask your Messenger?.The third: that the Muslims were asking Muhammad ﷺ about matters that have no best in searching for them, so that they may teach them, as he asked the Jews, Moses, on the authority of the peace of God About searching for him.The lord: He asked people from the Muslims to make them the same as the whims, as the polytheists had the same, and it was a tree that they worshiped, and they were stuck to it.And the polytheism, as they asked Moses to make them a god as God had a god.The second saying: It is a speech for the people of Mecca, and it is the saying of Ibn Abbas and Mujahid.He said: The servant of God, the son of the mother of the Mukhsum, came to the Messenger of God ﷺ in a murder from Quraysh.You have a paradise of palm trees and grapes, or you will have a house of virginity, or you will live in the sky to escalate, and we will not believe in your heart, so that you will not be so far.From God to (P-213) Abdullah ibn Umayya that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, followed him.And the rest of Al -Ratta said to him: If you do not have the right to a book from God, one sentence is one, in which it is permissible, the forbidden, the limits, and the exiles, as well God has all that, so we believe in you with that.So God Almighty is: Or do you want to ask your Messenger, Muhammad, that the verses come to you from God, as he asked the seventy, and they said: “May God see us.” On the authority of Mujahid: that a Quraysh asked Muhammad, peace be upon him He made them a gly with a silver and a silver, so he said: Yes, it is for you as a building for the children of Israel, so they doors and returned.The third saying: what is meant by the Jew, and this saying is correct; Because this surah is one of his first saying: Japanese, I remember my grace [Al -Baqarah: 47] is a story about them, and a need with them, and because the verse is a city, and it is a city, The remembrance of others was ran, and because the believer in the Messenger is hardly asking him, then if he asked him, he was a disbelieving in faith.The third question: It is not in the appearance of his saying: Or do you want to ask your Messenger as you were asked Moses before that they came to the question, and the question is not.The reference is in it to the novels that we mentioned that they asked, and God knows.The following question: Know that the question that they mentioned if that was a request for miracles, so who is it disbelief?And it is known that the indication of the evidence for the thing is not an infidel, and if that is a request for the face of the verdict in the copying of the rulings, then this is also not a disbelief; The angels asked the detailed wisdom in the creation of humanity, and that was not atoning, so perhaps the first person carried the verse on the authority that they asked for it to make it to him that he has made it possible The gods, and if they demanded the miracles, they are asking them for the path of curse and the sacrifice, for this, they disbelieve in this question.The fifth question: Remember this verse in connection with what was before it, and one of them: one of them: that it is up to the ruling on the bases of copy The judgment, so God forbade them from it, and he showed that they have no to seek this questions, just as it was not for the people to remember them.And the second: When you were presented from the teasers and the naughty, he said to them: If you did not accept what I commanded you and you repeat the obedience, you were asking Moses that he did not ask him; On the authority of Abu Muslim.And the third of it: when it was forbidden, he said: Do you do what you commanded, or do you do as you did those before you from the people of Moses?The sixth question: both the ways and his stretching.And the likeness of the likeness in that is that whoever has the path of faith is a neighbor on the leading residence to the winner and the nail by the request of the reward and the blessing, for the sake of the good On the authority of the righteousness, it was said in it: It is a misfortune of the way.
