The researcher is the Almighty: We have seen your face and your face in the sky, so let us provide you with a kiss, you will be satisfied, and your face is the dominance of the mosque, and when you are.And those who have given the book to know that the truth is from their Lord, and what God has forgiven what they do (P-100) know that his saying: We have seen you to turn in the way that he will turn in The first saying: It is the most famous for which the most interpreters, that it was to wait for his conversion from the house of the sacred to the kaaba, and the one who said this Wohoh: One of it: He was distorting the tour of the holy house, and he loved the tension to the Kaaba, except that he did not speak to that, so he was in this way.The meaning, narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: “O Jabriel, and I would have been given that God Almighty has forgotten me from the kiss of the Jews to others.Like you, ask your Lord, so he made the Messenger of God ﷺ He perpetuates the look of the sky, please come to the coming of what he asked, so God Almighty has revealed, Because of this insult to matters.The first: that the Jews were saying: He violates us, then he follows our kisses, and if we would not be able to do so, he would not be accepted, so that he will be accepted.They kissed them.The second: The kaaba was before Ibrahim.The third: that he - peace be upon him - was able to make this reason for the Arabs and their entry into Islam.The lord: He - peace be upon him - loves to obtain this honor for the mosque who is in his country and his origins, not in another mosque, and he is supposed to be the judge.He - peace be upon him - is worthy of him - to be distorted before he is commanded to pray to her, and that he loves him to turn him his Lord from it until a kiss, and he will give it to him.His lust because he - peace be upon him - knew and learned that the righteousness is in the dispute of the pride and the inclination.Know that this interpretation is a little acquisition; Because the developed of the Messenger is to be presented with what God has commanded, and he is filled with what he called him to him, so that he tends to be a heart of his heart, then he will tend to the heart of his heart.God permits him to him, so that is what is not a denial of it, especially if he does not speak to him, that is, after that the messenger of the Messenger is inclined to something, then he will be in something In it, and this is what I do not redeem in it with face from the faces.The second face: that he - peace be upon him - has given permission for Gabriel - peace be upon him - that God Almighty prayed for that, so he will tell him that God has been given to God.That is because the prophet does not ask God to come to something except with permission from him, so that they do not ask what is not good in it, so they will not be answered, so that this will lead to that You are bound by their affairs, so when God's ears, he called him in the answer, he knew that he would be answered to him, so he would flip his face in the sky, and he is waiting for him - With the way of answering.The third face: Al -Hassan said: Gabriel - peace be upon him - came to the Messenger of God ﷺ tells him that God Almighty will turn the kiss from the house He shows him to any position he transfers, and it was not a kiss that loved the Messenger of God ﷺ from the Kaaba, so the Messenger of God was flipping in the face of the heavens; Because he - peace be upon him - knew that God Almighty does not leave him without a prayer, so Jabriel - peace be upon him - came to him - so he commanded him to pray, and the one who said: They disagreed, and for those who said: He - peace be upon him - is forbidden to take care of the sanctuary of the sanctuary, and the kiss was not appointed to him, so he was afraid that he would not return the prayer and did not return His prayers were delayed; So, he was flipping his face, from the deaf, and others said: Rather, he promised that and kissed the house of the sanctuary.He signs that, and because he was hoping for the revelation of the house of the sacred to the kaaba, many faces from the religious reconciliation, the rituals of the Lord: And what is on the authority of Jews, and the opposite of the hypocrisy, for this, then he was flipping its face, and this face is first, otherwise it was not the second kiss for the first people.Beginning, and those who are involved in the fact that it is a copy of the first, and because it is not permissible that (P-101) is commanded by prayer except with the position of the position of the ritual.The fourth: that it turns its face in the sky is the supplication.The second saying: It is the saying of the father of the Muslim Al -Asfahi, they said: Without the news that was indicated by this saying, otherwise he would not be the verse, and he will be destroyed, Peace - He was flipping his face at the beginning of the city of the city, so it was narrated that he - peace be upon him - was if he prayed with the fruit of the kaab, and he made it between him A prayer to the kaaba, when he was immoral, he did not know where to go, so he waited for the command of God to be exalted until he said: So he gave your face to be the one.The second question: they disagreed in his prayers to the house of the sanctuary, so a people said: It was with a king to pray to the kaaba, so when he became to the city, he did not go to the city.Seven ten months, and a people said: Rather, he was praying to the house of the sanctuary, except that he made the heel between him and between it: and he said: Just the first seven months, then God Almighty commanded him to go to the heels because of the righteousness in it.The third question: they disagree in The Prophet ﷺ was directed to the house of the sanctuary, was it a pleasure that is not permissible, or if the Prophet ﷺ was a choice in his direction to him and otherwise, so he said: Ibn Abbas said, Ibn Abbas said: The tour was to him, and he was fulfilled by no choice.And know that he was on the authority of the two misfortunes, he had become a fool, and the gates were brought up to the first saying of the Qur’an and the telling, but the Qur’an said: So, when they take over, then the face of God [Al -Baqarah: 115], and that requires that it is a choice in the direction of the face to any side, and as for the news, what was narrated by Abu Bakr al -Razi, “A bit of the Messenger - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - from the city to the Mecca of the sale before the migration, and there was the Bin Bin Maarour, and it is in the authority of the His way, and the others refused and said: He - peace be upon him - goes to the house of the sanctuary, and when they came to the Mecca they asked the Prophet ﷺ, and he said to him: The sanctuary is - even if it was proven to be rewarded for it, and he did not command it to abuse the prayer.Let us curse you before you will be satisfied, and it was referred to that he - peace be upon him - would not have been satisfied He turned to it with the fact that what was shown by us was that he was not a choice between her and between the kaaba.The following question: the famous that the guidance is to the house of the sanctuary, but it has become a textured by the matter by the direction to the Kaaba, and from the people who said: to the one who said: Him, with the words of His Excellency: to God, the Mustark and the Wester The forbidden and begged him with the Qur’an and the effect, but the Qur’an is that it is the first to mention the first saying: It is for God, the honorable and the Maghreb, so that you will not be the same After him: The fools will say from the people what they have before their kisses that they were on, then he mentioned after it: So, and your face is the ritual of the mosque, and this is the ritual The validity of the gold, which we said that the tour of the sanctuary is the sanctuary of the sanctuary.The fools will say from the people delayed in the descent and the grave of his saying, the Almighty: So, and your face is the dominance of the mosque, the forbidden, then it is a matter of it.Pressing on the disagreement of the original, then you have proven what we said, and the effect is what was narrated from Ibn Abbas that the kissing command was the first of what was copied from the Qur’an, and the command of the matter The sanctuary is not mentioned in the Qur’an, but it is mentioned in the Qur’an: and for God, the deceased and the West, so when they are assumed, then the face of God (p-102) is the one who says: So your face is the dominance of the mosque, the dirty people, for that, not for the matter to go to the house of the sanctuary.* * * As for his saying: Let us provide you with a kiss that you will be satisfied with, and it is in it.And you have such, if you made it and to me, or let us make you name it without the name of the sanctuary.The second question: its saying: it is satisfied with it in it.Because the kaaba was loved to him, other than it, according to the inclination of the printing, the judge said: This is not permissible, for it is a referral that God Almighty says: So let you be.Because he praises his ruling on what he costs, and praises in the case of the Prophet - upon him prayer and peace - as he wants it in the case of the mandate, and this is a weakness; Because the stabbing is directed, if God Almighty said: We turned you into the kiss that the tendency of you to be made to it with a mile of you, so that he said: Which I have made it to me for the sake of the wisdom and the reconciliation and agreed to the mill of your ribs, for any harm that is required of it!And he - peace and blessings be upon him - said: “The village of my eyes was made in prayer.And the second: before it is satisfied, that is, it loves it by its disgrace on the religious reconciliation.And the third of it: The deaf said: That is, every side, may God guide you to it, for you is a satisfaction that is not permissible to be disturbed, as he did whoever turned against his two punishment The kiss turned back.And its lord: you are satisfied with it, that is: you are satisfied with its punishment, because you know who follows you for Islam, so whoever follows you for this from this world will afflict it or make it.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: He gave your face to be the dominant mosque, so he has angios: the first question: what is meant by the face is the sentence of the religion of the human being; Because it is obligatory for a person to accept the kiss with his sentence, not by his face, only, and the face is mentioned and the same thing is mentioned; Because the face is the honor of the members, and because the face is characterized by some people from one, for this reason, all the self is expressed.The second question: The people of the language said: The ablution is a blessed name that falls on two meanings: one of them: the half is said: I have been said, that is, the one who has made it, I walked to you, that is, his half.The second: His grace and his meeting with his face, and the Shafi’i witnessed - may God be pleased with him - in the book “The Mission” on this with four verses: He said: ؎ Except for the one who is notified as a messenger, and the mission is rich in the way of Amr and said Sa`da ibn Ja`yah: ؎ I say to the mother of Zanbah: I stand up.For the sake of the hands: ؎ I have a shadow of your hair.Al -Ain Al -Mashour said Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him -: He wants to meet her eyesight of the eyes, enchanted, if you know this, then say: In the verse: The two companions of the companions, the followers, and the late, and the chosen of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - in the book of the message: that the intention: Abi Bin Kaab, “The meeting of the mosque.” The second saying: It is the saying of Al -Juba’i and the judge’s choice that what is meant is from the part of Hahna: the extension of the mosque and its description; Because the ablution is the half, and the heels are located from the mosque in the half of all sides, so when the duty was to go to the kaab, and the kaaba was in the righteousness of the kaaba It is good for him to say: So, the sacrifice of the mosque is the forbidden, meaning the half of each side, as if it is a dome on the authority of the kaabi, who said: We mentioned our time.The first: The worshiper is outside the mosque, even if he stands, where he will be crowned to the mosque, but he will not be married to the description of the mosque The Kaaba does not correct his prayers.The second: If we were pleased with us, we did not remain the male of the maleva is a increased increase; Because if you say, then you will be the one who gave the mosque, then you will get the good and the one who is required.So if it was said: He was the face of the mosque that is not understood from it and the direction of the direction to its description, which is the place of the kaab, so what is said: The mosque, this is the most of the increased, so this was the sake of this memorizer.Al -Shari is increasingly increased, which is that if he said: He gave the face of the mosque, the forbidden, and the unbearable deposit is required; Because whoever is in the maximum or the Moroccan is not able to take over the face of the mosque, but if he says: He is the one who is the one who is the mosque, the mosque, that is, the side The present and the absent, our saying: This is the most beneficial from his saying: So when you were, they were your faces, so it does not remain for his saying: A more increased increase, this is the report of this face, and there is a problem because it becomes estimated: the first of the mosque is the same In half, and a difference between the half and between the position on which it is It is accepted, and the words are upright, even if it is carried on the second, except that the memorization does not indicate it, and they have been disagreed with that what is meant by the mosque is something?It is narrated in the book “Sharh Al -Sunna” on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said: The house is a kiss for the people of the mosque, and the mosque is a kiss for the people of the forbidden The outlook and the Moroccan, and this is the saying of Malik.And others said: The kiss is the Kaaba, and the evidence is upon him what was brought out in the two valids from Ibn Jarraj, on the authority of Ata, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: The Prophet ﷺ The house was called in all its aspects and did not pray until it came out of it, and when he came out of two rak'ahs, he said: The many news returned in the kissing of the kaaba, and in the news of Al -Barai ibn Azib: The prayer of the people of the people: He came to them, and he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ turned into the Kaaba.It was turned into the Kaaba.Another said from him, and others said: What is meant from the mosque is all forbidden, and the evidence is upon him.1] And he - peace and blessings be upon him - is a prisoner of the mosque, so this indicated that all of the sanctuaries are called the mosque.* * * Some of them are close to the house from the imam, it is permissible.Because he has sufficient destination, and this is the choice of Sheikh Al -Ghazali - may God have mercy on him - in the book of life, the argument of Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - the Qur’an, and the Qur’an, and the Qur’an, This is the same as the verse and that because we have indicated that what is meant is from the waters of the mosque, the side of its side, and the side of the thing is the one who is destroyed by it and it is in its name It is said: if it is a good and his face to the side of Omar, and if he met his face and his face, and made him adjacent to him, even if he was the face of each of them.It does not be the face of one of them, adjacent to the face of the other.As for the news, what was narrated - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - when he came out of the kaaba, kneeling two knees in the kiss of the kaaba and said: “This is the kiss”, and this is the word that is not.The kiss except the eye of the kaaba, and the one who narrated the news that we narrated that the kiss is the kaaba, and the measurement is that the emptiness of the Messenger ﷺ is in the righteousness The frequency, and the prayer is one of the greatest divisions of religion, and the agitation of its health on the eyes of the eye of the kaaba with what is required to obtain the more honorable of the Kaab, so that it is the honor of the kaab.Because the one of the kaaba is a kiss, and it is a matter of kissing Receive the kaaba, and Abu Hanifa embarked on matters.The side in which the kaab was obtained in which it came with what he was commanded by whether it was accepted for the kaaba or not, so he must be released from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been.Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “What is between the righteous and the Maghreb is a kiss.” That everything is true that it is between an outlook and a strange thing, because it is a kiss, because the side of the northern pole is true to it The thing that is between a certain orientation and an exile before the kiss, and we carry that on the one who is among the honorable people and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one That is a kiss and that is because the east is a south of the place that is diluted from the line of containment in the place of the molice, and the Moroccan is a northern, northern With the fate of the inclination, which is among them, I named Mecca, they said: This hadith is that it is indicated by our gossip from it from it with the way to the one who is good The first: that the people of the mosque were in the prayer of the morning in the city of the city.However, the kiss was transferred to the Kaaba, so they were running during the prayer from other than the request of a sign, and the Prophet was not denied ﷺ to them, and he called the mosque, The eye is from the city to the Mecca that is not known only to a generous evidence that is in which the view is long, so how can they realize it on the beginning of the prayer.The covenant of (P-105), the Messenger of God ﷺ, the children of the mosque in all of the country of Islam, and they did not bring a jur With the verge From his faces: The first: If he had been excluded from the eye of the kaaba and a duty either knowledge or suspicion, then the prayer of one of a cat should not be corrected; Because if it is the perpetrator of the nickname and twelve arm, then it is known that the people of the deceased and the Moroccan are so unfortunate that they stand in this way, this is the same That the one who falls from them in the severity of this few is a few of the proportions to a lot, and it is known that the lesson is in the rulings of the law in the vastness, and the dignity is not, and it is not true.The prayer of one of them is valid, and that is the one who signed in the alignment of the kaaba, which cannot know that it was signed in its hitching, and where the nation gathered the prayer The alignment is not considered, if it is said: the circle, even if it is great, except that all the points are the one that is adjacent to it, it is adjacent to the way of the custodian, and the core of the man The world with its families, as if it is constant with the heel, and the heel, as if it is a point for the circle, but if the circle is small, the mud is in the past And it was not a greed for every one of its two sections, but we see every piece of it, with the righteous steps, so there is no generosity in the validity of the gum.The detence and the Moroccan increase its height on the weakest of the house, and everyone is calling those who go to the eyes of the kaaba, say: He gave the matter to what you mentioned, and you are the one who mentioned it.Great, even if it is young in the line straight in the sense, but it is necessary to be curved in itself; Because it was if it was straightforward, as well as the saying in all the pieces of that circle, then the condemnation will be a compound from the rituals of the rituals Some of it, then it is necessary for the circle to be either a misfortune or a straight line, and all of that is referred, so we know that every piece of the servant is in the past Currently, the descriptions connected to the frameworks of the world are only one of them, which is accepted for the eyes of the kaaba, if it is not that of the row, the line is located.Rather, if there is a few grains in it, that is the little gravity that does not fulfill its awareness of the sense of time, it is not possible to be in the place Every one of these classes is ignorant that he is an exclusion of the eyes of the kaaba or not, and if he had been arrested in the eyes of the kaab, he would have been a condition of this condition.And suspicion in the condition of the condition requires doubt in the crushing of the conditions, so every one of the people of this class remains a complaint in the health of his prayers, and that is not the same On the authority of the bit, and where the nation gathered on the authority that it is not like that, we know that the eyes are not in a condition Neither knowledge nor suspicion, and this is clear words.The second: If he had been in the eyes of the Kaaba, he was not a duty, and there is no way to it except with the Indian mourning The Indian connotation is obligatory for every one, and when it was not like that, we have learned that they would be excluded from the eyes of the kaaba other than it is not obligatory It is not met, and the lack of the Indian indicators is the righteousness, not a belief, we said: If he was excluded from the kaaba, it was obligatory for the sake of the righteous, not the one who is not He has the right to think, and the man is able to obtain this with the mediation We knew that I would see the eye of the kaaba.(P-106) The third: If the eyes were excluded and obligatory, either knowledge or suspicion, and knowing that there is no way to do so, only with the types of Emirates, and what is not obligatory, and what is not obligatory It was necessary for those Emirates to be aware of aid on each one of the costs, and when it was not like that, we know that it was not the same.* * * The loyal question: in the domestication of the kiss: I know that the evidence is either the land and it is the cultivation, villages, and the flowers, or the antenna, which is the one who is the one who is the one, or the one who is the one, or the one who is the one who is It is the stars.As for the ground and the air, it is not a whole, and the rap of a way in which there is a raised mountain that does not know that it is on the right of the one or the one or the one or the one or the one or the one or the one or the one or its north or the one or its north It is behind it, so the winds may be condemned in some of the country, and we are able to investigate that, for every country with another judgment in that.As for the heavens, it was broken from it, and it is anchoring, and the approximation has said: This is the evidence that it is a day or a day, or a day, or the day, or the day, or the day, or for the day Shams is not necessary and to take into account before the country from the country that the sun at the demise is between the two pilgrims, or is it on the eyes of the mother of Al -Yasri, or to the one who is a good The sun is not prepared in the northern country, this is the case, and so is the closure of the sun, the time of the time The strawberry, which is to know that the sun is strange for the imam of the future, or is it connected to its face or its standing, and so is the time of the last dinner, And the time of the morning is known to be sunshine, so the sun was indicated by the kiss in the five prayers, but the ruling of that is different from that And the hardships are many, and the judgment is different in this chapter on the behavior of the country, and the night is that it is that The kiss is inferred by the cousin, which is said to him, for it is a clamp as the garment does not appear.Or his faithful affliction from his back, or his affliction in the northern country of Mecca, and in the southern country of it, such as those who are behind it, and what is left of it, and what is in the absence He knew him in his country, so let him be on the way of all of him, unless the travel is long, then the distance, if you go away from the sun, and the satellite, and the satellite Al -Mashraq and Al -Mughraba until he finished during his travel to a country, so we will ask that the people of the visionary ask or watch these curtains while he is accepted It is clear to him, so they know this evidence, so he may be dependent on it.As for the Laqiniya style, which is the uniform in the books of the body, they said: The kiss was named the point of the prohibitions between the perpetuation of the horizon, and between the greatness of the Our heads and the heads of the people of Mecca, and the ritual of the kiss is a measure of the horizon of the horizon between the name of the kiss, the course The accusative is the perfection of the warning, and they said: And it needs in the acquaintance of the kiss to the knowledge of the length of Mecca and its presentation, then the length of the country is equal to the length of the country In contrast to the exposure of Mecca, I was named before it on the line of half of the day.To offer Mecca and its length is contrary to its long, it may be thought that you were named before that country on the line of accustomed Its views are contrary to the length of Mecca and its presentation, that I have been named before it is the following and its strangeness, and if it is so, then it is necessary for the sacrifice, Therefore, there is a way that makes it easier to know the part that the heads of the people of Mecca are forgotten from the king of the rose, which is (Zaha) from the wilderness (and the cousin) of (P-107).Part on the line and the mediation of the heaven in the length of the heavens to present the country, and teaches the arms a mark, then he turns the curse to the side On the authority of Mecca, as in the country of Kharasan and Iraq, with the amount of between the two times from the parts of the wage, then he looked at where the part of that part is from the domains of the ritual When that part is forgiven by the heads of the people of Mecca, then the sunset is kept in that part, then if the sun rises to the sun, then the sun is over.The sun is the people of the people of Mecca, so it is a measure and a step on the shadow of al -Muqadah as a line from the center of the column to the shadow of shadow, so that line is the shadow of the shadow So the wicked is based on him, for this is the words in the diligence of the kiss.The fifth question: the definition of the kisses is a pleasure on the eye or is a satisfaction on the sufficiency?In it, it is the same as the correction of them.Because every cost is a matter of arresting and cannot be paid only by the point of knowing the evidence of the kiss, and what is not required is only.* * * The sixth question: know that his saying is up to the Almighty: So when you were, they were your faces.The prayer is not obligatory and obligatory, but it is an obedience to his saying - peace be upon him -: Then we say: The man is either a sense of kissing or absent from it.On the establishment of the jungle or not appreciated on it, but it is appreciated by the argument of the suspicion, or it is not appreciated Three: the first section: the one who is able to get the knowledge in which there are two things: the first search: you have known that the absent from the kiss is not a way to it to the time The kiss is only by the Indian evidence, and there is no way to perform the duty except with it, it is obligatory, so it is obligatory from this that this is the knowledge of the evidence of the same The jurisprudence said: If its learning is not otherwise, they may have said: If you learn it, it is forbidden or prohibited, and I do not know what their excuses in this?The second research: the prayer is if it is the land of Mecca and between it and between the kaaba in the killing, and he was suspended from him, so he would have to strive?The owner of the “refining” said, “We look at it if the one is inherent is like a curse, so he has the guidance, and if it is not originally as the father, it is on the authority.One of them: He has the guidance because he is between him and between her is a barrier that prevents the testimony as in the original inhabitant.The second: He does not have the guidance because his refusal is the return to the two people, and he is able to obtain the leanness, so he must not be satisfied with it with the suspicion, and this is the one in it The verse; Because when it was indicated on the path of the direction to the heels, and the cost if it is valid on the acquisition of knowledge, it is not permissible for him to be satisfied with the suspicion.The second division: the one who is able to do the suspicion without the peat.And I know that the conclusion of this thought is a way: the first way: the guidance, and the appearance of the saying of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - requires that the wage is upon the authority The saying of others is the truth, and the one who is indicated by his faces: one of them: His exalted say: So be considered, my first sight [Al-Hashr: 2] (p-108) is a matter of adornment, and the man Approx into this image in this picture, so the matter must be informed.And the second: that this is what happened to the kissing side of the dowry; Because if he knew the kiss with the imitation, it was necessary for either sectarianism or the light while they are invalid, so it is imperative that the end of the matter to the one who has the end of the matter, The guidance is the first or the imitation of the owner of the guidance?There is no doubt that the first is the first because if it comes with the guidance, then it is not obligatory for him to invoke the mistake except from one side, so if the owner of the guidance is imitated, then he will be done to the one who has been done The mistake is from two sides, and there is no doubt that when the conflict was between two ways, then the least of them is a mistake in the pursuit.And the third of it: His saying - peace be upon him -: “If I command you with an command, then come from him what you can.That is.If it was said: Is it not that the owner of the “refining” mentioned that if it is in a large village in which there is a sacrifice that is based on one side, or a grandfather, or a brand, or a tin of the flag, in a tin, or a tin of the flag, in a sign of a tin, or a sign of a tin, Seriously for the Muslims, he must turn to it, and there is no effort on the one hand, he said: Because these signs are like a ritual, or in the sacrifice, or in the sacrifice It is permissible for him to strive with these signs, and Abdullah ibn al -Mubarak said after his return from the Hajj: You will be pleased, O people of Marwa, and for you to tell you He said: I saw the majority of Muslims or the group of Muslims agreed on this side, so he must accept it, and this is not a mourning, but it is the one who is a kneel The time, which is if it was notified by a justice: I saw the immorality, it has come or the sun has gone away, it is obligatory to accept his saying, this is all, so the owner of this A problem from its faces: one of them: that there is no meaning to imitation except the acceptance of the saying of others without an argument or suspicion, so if we accept the saying of others or the one who does not do it Other than an argument, no suspicion, this was a conversion, and we have mentioned the evidence that the Qadir is on the forefront, and it is necessary to be a matter.And the second: that it is permissible for the violation in the right and the house is based on the guidance, so he said: He is a valid of the arrival of the suspicion by building it, and the one who does not do it.The violator may be permissible as in the right and the left.And the third: Either it is a variety of guidance, or from the work with the necessity of the guidance, and the first is invalid; Because he was forbidden when he said: I pledged to my opinion, the Messenger of the Messenger - peace be upon him - on that, and indicated that the guidance is unaware of it, and the second is, and the second is also Because when he knew or thought that the kiss was not in the side in which the wizard was That is the sacrifice of that, as a risk of imitation of the recipient and that it was wrong.And its elevation: that the Shafi’i is gone - may God be pleased with him - that it is not permissible for the glory to the imitation of the mujahid, so the one who is able to do the one is the same He has the imitation of the country's incest?And those who say that the wickedness of the loving of the country from the country from its faces: the first: that it is like the frequencies with the guidance, so it is obligatory for it.The second: If a man sees the muezzin, he will empty the call to prayer and residence, and the imam may be presented, so we do not need to know the time, so this is so.The third: that the people of the country are satisfied with it, and the most promising that if he had sinned, they would be alerted to him, and if they were alerted to him, they would not be satisfied with it, so what would be in it.The second way: the return to the saying of others, such as if it is notified by a justice of the kiss of the kiss in this side, then this is not the same as the kiss, and there is no one.It must be from two conditions: Islam and the mind, so there is no lesson in this section by saying the infidels and the madman, and they did not know, and they were dispersed in the three -bars.First: the eloquence.Al -Khudari narrated a text about Al -Shafi’i that he does not accept the saying of the boy, and Abu Zaid also narrated that Al -Shafi’i was accepted.And the second: the elevation said: The news of the evildoer (P-109) is not accepted because it is like martyrdom, and it was said: it is accepted.And the third of it: the number, for those who have expressed it, as in the testimony, not those who expressed the number in the novel as well, and for those who did not consider the number.And it is separated from what we have said: The first: The first: that everyone who was taking it by saying it is stronger, the most powerful, the taking of his saying was presented to the one who has been taken.For example, the imitation of the miserable is successful in the imitation of the oppression, and the imitation of the diligent is the first of the imitation of those who imitated it.And the second: that if he knows that the guidance does not fulfill until the time of time is spent, then the first one has the right to obtain the guidance until the prayer is made by a judgment or the ritual of the ritual.Performance, in which hesitation.And the third of it: Whoever does not know the evidence of the kiss, has the return to the saying of others at the time of prayer, but it is obligatory.The third way: If he witnessed in the house of Islam, a tin is permissible for him to go to the detail that was presented, but if he sees the kiss in a way People or in a way in which Muslims and the participants pass through, and he does not know whoever set it up or saw a wickedness in a village and does not know that the Muslims are or the one who was the Muslims or the one who was the Muslims or the one who was the Muslims or the one who was the Muslims or the Muslims or the one who was the Muslims or the Muslims or the Muslims A young village for Muslims who does not overcome the suspicion, as the people of its people, are lords on the evidence of the kiss, and the guidance must be upon him.The righteous way: what is installed from the guidance and the saying of others, which is that a person tells him about the occurrence of the makers and he was A scientist who is inherent in the kiss, for we must be satisfied with what he hears if he is unable to see her with himself.The third section: which has been broken from the fact that the knowledge and the suspicion, which is the one who is in the darkness that hidden the Emirates with its secret to it, or the blind who does not find it The emirates of his religion and the disturbance of the hypothesis, and in it research: the first search: that this person is impossible to be a matter of guidance; Because the guidance is not a sign or a matter that is not unbearable, and it is exile, and only three matters remained: either it is said to be the same as the prayer of the prayer The condition requires the conditions to be met by conditions, so we do not have to pray, or it is said: the condition of the ritual is the one who has taken away from the time The journey is also to drop here, so he must come to the prayer to any side, and he will be taken away from the condition The flaws are to come out of the truce with two parts, for this is the possible faces, but the rituals of prayer from him are void by gun I was valid with the end of the future, as in the case of the numbers and in the Nafila, and the positive prayer to all the flaws is also invalid to perform the indication that the duty is upon him, and the duty is upon him.He says: Is it not that whoever forgets a prayer from the prayers of the day and nights and does not know its eyes, then it is obligatory for him to spend these prayers with their family to leave, so that he will leave it.It is permissible for the matter to be like that?They said: And when the division was appointed, the third is the selection of all flaws.The second research: that if his heart is money until this side is the first to be a kiss from the path of the flaws, it is unless that is the sustaining of the authority That is the jurisprudence of the jurisprudence and the inclination of the heart to it, so it is considered this guidance, and is the cost of the cost that it is dependent on it or not?The first is that this is an adequate; For his saying - peace be upon him -: “The believer looks at the light of God.(P-110) The third research: If this prayer performs, then the phenomenon requires that he does not have to be eliminated; Because he performed the time of time and has been correct from it, then it is obligatory that it is not obligatory to return, and the appearance of the saying of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - His mistake.* * * Because whoever was inside the heels is not augmented To all the kaaba, but it will be married to some of its parts, and managed from some of its parts, and if it is not, it is not accepted for each His prayers; Because God Almighty commanded to receive the house, he said: As for the Nafila, it is biased; Because the kissing in it is not obligatory, the pilgrimage of the phrase is what the Sheikh has brought out in the two health, and Al -Shafi’i narrated it - may God be pleased with him - Omar, “He - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - entered the Kaaba and he and the son of Zaid, and Uthaman ibn Abi Talah, and Bilal, so he closed it to him, and he said: So I asked Bilal when he came out: What did the Messenger of God make?Blind, then prayed.”He knew that the reciprocate of this news is weak from his faces: one of them: that the news of the one does not oppose the phenomenon of the Qur’an.And the second: Perhaps that prayer was navigational, and that is with a good money.And the third of it: that your money is free of this news, and the violation of the narrator, even if it does not require stabbing in the news, except that it benefits the kind of kindness in the lineage, to the one who is the same, to the one who is the same, to the one who is the one who is the same, How is the lineage to the Qur’an.And its booster: that the two sheikhs are in the right ones.He came out of it, and when he came out of the knees of two knees by the kaaba and said: “This kiss is“ and the opposition is from two faces: the first: that the nose is the one.And the second: His saying ﷺ: “This kiss is indicated that it is necessary from the face of that position and whoever passes the prayer within the house, it is not necessary Rather, he was brought up.And the answer to the cursing of your money - may God have mercy on him - to say: His saying: And where you were either that it is the form of a general or not, then if it is a form Who is in the house, as if he is up to the one who was in the house to turn to him, then I come to him will be out of the task It is a matter of this misfortune, so do not indicate its ruling, neither by the negation nor by the evidence, then the one who is used in the question is that the one is not the one who does not The house, but it can go to the part of the house, and who is in the house heading to a part of the parts About the pledge.* * * The eighth question: Know that the kaab is a expressive bodies, which are the water, the walls, and the construction, and there is no doubt that those bodies are in the bias of a special alignment, The kiss is either that the bias is only, or those bodies only, or those bodies on the condition of their obtaining in that bias, not permissible to say that it is said that it is said that it is not possible.Because we have gathered on the authority that if we say the dust of the kaaba and what is in its construction from the stones and the wood to another position, and built it with it with a construction and the one in the prayer, there is no one in the prayer.It is said: It is for those bodies on the condition of their sins in that bias; Because the kaaba if it was guided and the grace of God, and it was removed from that bias, those stones and the wood, and the discharge remained empty, then the people of the Mashriq (P-111) They went to that side, their prayers were authenticated, and they were accepted for the kiss, and it was not left until it is said: The kiss is that of the emptiness, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The meaning is that you have proven with the mind that we mentioned, as it is also a custodian for the verse; Because the mosque is a name for that constructive construction from the water and the walls, and the destiny and the face of the mosque is the bias in which you have received that With the direction of the mosque, the kiss was that destiny of emptiness and hydrolysis.In its drain, it does not correct his prayers; Because he is not intended to accept the kiss, and Ibn Siri mentioned that he is correct, and he is the saying of my father Hanifa, and the choice is with me, and the evidence is upon him that it is not for me.The estimated destiny of the emptiness, and the stand in the client is accepted for a part of the parts of that emptiness, so it will be accepted for the kiss, so it is necessary to say that it is.Standing on the surface of the kaaba is unless it is in his turnout a grandfather whose prayers are not valid except on the saying of Ibn Siri Because it is accepted for that emptiness and the hypothesis, which is the kiss, then it is obligatory to correct his prayers.* * * The duty is fulfilled only by it, then it is obligatory, and the piece is required with the duty of the guidance, and the guidance must be based on the thought, so the verse was indicated by the verse So she proves that the deposit of the consent is located in the sentence, and the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - was inferred - so that the measurement is a pilgrimage, and he is a weak, and it is a weak, and it is a weak, and it is a place in the Shara.Because it is a proof of the measurement with the measure, and that is not a way to it, and God knows.The questioner: The phenomenon is that it is not obligatory to receive the kiss; Because the verse was indicated by the path of receipt, and the one who comes with it is what the verse was indicated by it, so it is obligatory that it is not obligatory for it to be another intention, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the same, as is the one who is in the same way.The purity of the place and the dump.The sharp question is ten: the kisses are drawn up when the excuse is as in the case of the nose, and the fear is attached to it on the soul, from the soul, or from the one, from the one, from the one, from the one, from the one, from the one, from the one, or from the same The relevant camel, or when the mistake in the kiss is due to the reign and the sample, or in the performance of the nawfil, and this requires that the one who is unable to do the knowledge and the one who does not do it is that he will do it The judiciary, as well as the mujtahid, if he has the appointment of sin.The second question is twenty: If he goes to a side, then he will be deceived, and he is in prayer, then he must be buried, transformed, and builds, because he does not know, because he does not know.So, one of the truthful is an expert, and then another came - its soul to him, I dwell - and he told him about his disagreement, so this is what is attached to the good things in the mind Install and God knows.* * * His Excellency said: And where you were, and their faces, his part of it, in it two issues: the first question: this is not a remedy, and his two years.One of them: that his saying is up to the Almighty: He gave your face to be a rhetoric of the mosque, a discourse with the Messenger - peace be upon him - not with the nation, and he said: It is a discourse with all.And secondly: that what is meant by the first is their address, while they are in the city in particular, and it was from the permissible, even if the dismissal was signed by him, he would think that this kiss is for the family of the family God Almighty, when they got from the ground, must accept this kiss.“ It was said: wherever you are, and fulfillment is an answer.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: And those who have given the book to know that the truth is from their Lord, and what God is with the heavie of what they do is in the two questions: Those who have given the book to the Jews in particular, and the book is Al -Tawarah on the authority of the Sadd Antarcticity and the Gospel, and they must be a little number; Because the many are not permissible for them to be overwhelmed.The second question: the guilt in its saying: that the truth is returned to a precedent mentioned, and the remembrance of the Messenger may be presented as the remembrance of the kiss is presented.The people know that the Messenger is with his law and his prophets are true, so that this is covered by the kiss and others, and it is necessary to return to this With the kiss, and they know that it is the right, and this is the most recent affordment.Because he is ahead of words, as what is meant by the verse is without it, and then they disagreed that they were known that?And they mentioned it in it: one of them: that a people of Jews were known in the books of their prophets, the Messenger told the Messenger, and the kiss was told, and that it was prayed to the kiss.And the second: that they knew that the Kaaba is the ancient house that God has made a kiss for Abraham, and to listen to them, peace.And the third of it: that they knew the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ for what appeared to him from the miracles, and when they knew his prophets, then they did not know that it is not the case, so it is not the case, so it is not the case, so it is not the case, so it is not the case.This was truly this.* * * As for his saying: What is God with a heavie of what they do in his two questions: the first question: the son of a son of Amir, a garment, and the sake: For Muslims, and those who remain in the case that he returned to Jews.The second question: If we make it a speech to the Muslims, then it is a matter of their goodness, that is, it is not hidden from you and your grandfather in the acceptance of the religion, so do not make it.With the Jews, it is a feast and a threat to them, and it is also inevitable that it is not a heedless from their rewards and their metaphors, and if it is not hurried to them, as it is like it: When the unjust do, but they delay them for a day when the eyes are diagnosed [Ibrahim: 42].
