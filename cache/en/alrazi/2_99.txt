The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: We have revealed to you with clear verses for you and what they disbelieve except the evolving people.They used to open up on the Awis and the Khazraj with the Messenger of God ﷺ before he sent him, and when he was sent from the Arabs, they disbelieved in it and they did not say: Mountains, the twentieth of the Jews, fear God and convert to Islam, so you were open to us with Muhammad His description, so some of them said what came to us with something of the evidence and what is in the one that we mentioned to you, so God Almighty revealed this verse, and we are the one who is the one who is: The signs are the verses of the Qur’an, which does not come with the likeness of heaven and humanity, even if some of them were for some noon The sins of the evidence, we have their abstinence from the flame and from the death of the death and the miracles of the miracles.And the sink of the moon.The judge said: The first one is specialized in the Qur’an, because if the verses are compassionate to the download, they were devoted to the Qur’an, and God knows.The second question: the direction in the name of the Qur’an with the verses of it: one of them: that the verse is the indication, and if the hearts of the Qur’an are indicative of the eloquence of it.And the second: that some of them indicate the news about the seduction, it is indicative of that challenge.And the third: It is indicative of the evidence of the neutrality, the prophecy, and the partnership, as there are verses from this side, because it is said: the evidence is only between what is clear and what is the meaning Show, and no one will say that the person is like it (P-182), two of them; Because this is valid, even if it is possible in the sciences to be stronger than some and that is referred to, and that is because the scientist with the thing is either that he will get it.He believed it or does not get it, for if he gets with him, it is not that of that belief, and if it is not an impermissible, there is nothing.We said: Deception does not fall into the same science, but rather on its way; The sciences are divided into what is the way that it will be obtained and the evidence indicates that the most advanced is the most difficult, and the one is the most difficult, and to what is less The access to it is close, and this is the evidence.The third question: the landing of the sacrifice of the thing from the top to the bottom, and that is not achieved except in the generosity, so it is on this words, it is referred to it, but it is from the righteous, but it is from the first The lower, and I told it to be called a landing.* * * As for his saying: What is atoning for it is only the immoral, in it, the first question: the infidelity With it from two faces: one of them: it is with it with the knowledge of its health.The second: its wigs with ignorance and the leaving the view in it and the symptoms of its evidence, and in the phenomenon, it is specialized, so everyone enters it in it.The second question: The immorality in the language is the most prominent of the human being.It was removed from the wetness at its throats, and the nucleus was made, and it may bring about the meaning of the immorality because it is taken from the debris of the dam, which prevents the water from the water from the water that the water is forbidden He spoils [if he becomes to him], and the human being, the human being, did not limit him to corruption with the one who blew the dam until it became where he was spoiled.If it was said: Is it not that the small owner of God’s command and does not describe immorality and immorality?We said: It is called by every matter that is glorified from the door that reminds us, because whoever opens from the river is a preceptor that does not describe that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is so If the transgression is great.If this is proven, then we say in his saying: The immoral and Jahan: one of them: that every foolish disbeliever and does not reflect, as if the remembrance of the immoral comes to the infidel and the other.The second: That what is meant is what is atoning for it except the infidel that is equivalent to every limit in its disbelief, and the meaning is that these verses are when it was clear, and it is not unbelieving He is informed of the infidels to the extreme ending, and it is perpetuated from every improved limit in the mind and the legitimacy.
