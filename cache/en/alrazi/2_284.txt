The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: to God, what is in the heavens and what is in the land, and if you look at what is in your own, or hide it, God will hold you accountable for you In the verse: (P-108) the first question: In the Kayfa al-Namfah, it is the first: The first: The deaf said: It is the Almighty when it was collected in this surah, and there are many things, and it is a lot of things.The neutrality and prophecy, and many things from the knowledge of the origins with the bodies of the purchases and the crocodiles, which are in prayer, zakat, retribution, fasting, pilgrimage, jihad, jihad, and menstruation And the righteousness, the immorality, the wise, the breastfeeding, the sale, and the usury, and how the duration, the seal of God Almighty is this surah with this verse on the way of the guidance.And I say that it has been proven that the attributes that are as a realistic missionaries are only capable and knowledge, so they crossed it as the honor of the capacity in the saying of what is in the words of the sake of what is in it And a king, and expressing the fullness of the science surrounded by the kidneys and parties with its saying, and if you appear in what is in your own, or hide it, it will be calculated by God, and if God is, and if God is, then God is the same Everyone in the heavens and the earth is a servant who is found and found with his creation and formation.That was the end of the promise to the people, and the end of the good The reason is that God is the same.And the second face: in the sect of the system, the father of a Muslim said: It is up to what he said in the last of the advanced verse and God is what you do: The mental evidence said: God has what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and the meaning of this king that these things are what they were updated, so it was found with it and its creation and its creation It was an effective for this strange arbitrary verb, the strange, disorganized judgment and the great wise and the great benefits, and it is necessary for you to be a scholar of it The chest of the verb, the ruling that is mastered by the ignorance of it, as if God Almighty took the creation of the heavens and the land with what is in them the faces of the rulings and the rulings of it.Sitting its parts and parties.The third face: In the Keep of the Architecture, the judge said: It is up to the one who commanded these charity.He kept it, God Almighty indicated that it is the intended for a benefit that returns to creation, not because of the benefit that he will return to it from it, so it is for him to have the king.The Fast face: The Shaabi, Akrama, and Mujahid said: It is up to the end of the testimony of testimony and he is promised to him that he has the king of the heavens And the appearance.* * * The second question: begged The companions of his saying to God are not in the heavens and what is in the earth is that the act of the servant created God Almighty; Because it is one of the sum of the heavens and the earth with the same validity of the validity It is necessary for the person to be intended for the king and creation.* * * The third question: the companions of this verse begged that the enemy is not something because there is a sentence in the heavens and the earth, the truths Under the power of God, they will be glorified and exalted, but the truths and the whims will be under his ability, even if it was valid for the achievement of those facts, and those who are, Likewise, the power of God was an overall forms of pleasure, and achieved for the truth, and the saying was that the municipality is false.* * * Then he said: And if you appear in what is in your own or hide it, God will be rewarded for you, and it is narrated.And Abd al -Rahman ibn Awf, Mu’az and al -Nabi to the Prophet ﷺ, and they said: O Messenger of God, we have assigned us from the work that we do not like if one of us does not speak to what he does not have to do with what he does not have to do with what we do not have to do with what we do not have to do.His heart, and if he has the world, the Prophet said ﷺ: “Perhaps you will say as the children of Israel said: He heard us and disobeyed us, saying: He heard us and shed us.They are on them, and they have been in this way.What they spoke to themselves, they did not work or speak to it.God is the hadeeth of the soul, and the corrupt dimaks that respond to the heart, and it does not enable it to pay it, so the delay in it is a place of time, and it is not possible.On the authority of his faces: the first face: that the phases that occur in the heart are on two sections: some of them are what a person whispered to themselves and is determined by what is in it, and it is not in the way of it Likewise, there are things that are risky with the fact that the human being hates it, but it is not possible to pay it from the soul, so the first section is: it is not.I take it, not to see it to the words of the Almighty: God does not take you with the language of your faith, but he will take you with what your hearts have earned [Al -Baqarah: 225] She has been overlooked and on it what was gained [Al -Baqarah: 286] and he said: Those who love the obscenity of those who believe in those who believed [the light: 19] This is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been What does not enter the work, then it is in the place of forgiveness and its saying, even if You seem to be what is in your own or hide it, and God will hold you accountable for you, so what is meant by it is that he enters that work in the provision of either an appearance or either on the way of the hidden one, and what is in the mind Condolences and wills and did not communicate with work, so all of that is in the place of forgiveness.This answer is weak; Because the most of the pleasures are, but it is the verbs of hearts, not to see that the disbelief and innovation are not only from the hearts of the hearts, and the greatest of the punishment of the punishment is the same The wounds, if they are removed from the actions of the hearts, are not arranged for them as a punishment for the act of the sleeping and the Sahi, so you have proven the weakness of this answer.And the third face in the answer: that God Almighty takes it with it, but it is its disagreement is the domination and the concern in the world, the laughter narrated from Aisha, the one who is pleased with it, he said: He himself from evil was the accountant of God, with a grief that he would have in the world in the world, sorrow or harm I asked the Prophet ﷺ about this verse, and he answered her with what this is mean.If it is said: The delay is how to get in this world with the saying of the Almighty: Today, every soul is rewarded with what it has earned [Ghafir: 17].We said: This is specific, so it will be provided for that year.The one who is the one in the answer: that he said: God will hold you accountable for you and he did not say: God takes you with him and we have mentioned in the sense of his heart, and we are a good, and a decay, and a decay, That one of his interpretations is the same as the highest world, so he returned the meaning of this verse to his being, who is highly aware of everything in the annexes and the secrets, the narrators of the authority of the authority of the authority About them that he said: (P-110) God is exalted, if he collects the cells, he tells them what was in their souls, so the believer informs him and then pardon him, and he will be forgiven, From denying and sin.The fifth face is in the answer: It is the highest of this verse.Those are the phases, and the torment will be a share of those who are Egypt on those devices, improved for them.The sixth direction: some of them said: What is meant by this verse is the testimony of martyrdom, and it is weak; Because the memorizer is general, even if it is and he is the one who is a punishment for that judgment, whose palace is required.The one who followed the answer: What is narrated about some of the interpreters is that this verse is forgotten by its saying that God does not cost a soul except for it and this is the power of it [286] Lojoh: One of them: that this copy is correct, even if our saying: They were before this copy, who are commanded to be excluded from those devices, who were the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was so That is false because the axis is a cat that was not mentioned except in the capacity, and for that, peace be upon him said: And the second: The copy is that it is needed if the verse indicates the punishment for the punishment on those devices, and we have indicated that the verse does not indicate that it is not.It is permissible, but it is the one who is the one who is the one.He will be forgiven for someone who will be forgiven and tortured those who are in it.The obedient believer is cut off that he is rewarded and not punished, and the infidel is cut off that he is punished and not rewarded, and his saying is forgiven for whoever is brought up and torture And with the one of the two things, it was not that it is a share of the believer, which the singer inherits with his tanks.And it is tormented by the lifting of the Arabs and the epidemic, but the rest of the people, as for the raising, it is on the authority of the nose, and the ability: it is forgiven, and the reward is for you Abi Amr that he tired the Arabs in the blame in his saying: (He forgives those who will be forgiven).The melody with the knowledge of the people in Arabic.With his saying: And if you look at what is in your own or hide it, God will hold you to Him, that he is the whole of knowledge and surrounding Repels on all the possibilities of the fate, ability, formation, and hostility, nor as a higher and greater talism To be a servant who is criticized for him, subject to his sisters and his talents, he is embarrassed by his disadvantage and his talents, and by God the success.
