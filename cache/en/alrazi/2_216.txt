The Quranic researcher is the second ruling while it is related to the fighting: the fighting has been written for you, and it is a hatred for you, and perhaps you will hate something, and it is good for you, and it is possible that you love something You know his words, the Almighty: The fighting has been written for you, and it is a hatred for you, and perhaps you will hate something, and it is better for you, and perhaps you will love anything, and it is evil for you And in it is: the first question: He knows that he was praying and peace be upon him.The participants, then his permission to the partners ’association in general, then God imposed jihad.And the scholars differed in this verse, and a people said: It requires the obligation to fight against all.And on the authority of Makhoul that he was walked with the house with God that the conquest is obligatory, and it was transferred from Ibn Omar and Ata: that this verse is required and the righteousness is required Prayer and peace at that time.The first pilgrimage is that his saying: He was written that the obligatory must and his saying: You must require it as well.Al -Muwajoudin and those who will have after that, as in his saying: He was written on you [Al -Baqarah: 178], the fast is written on you [the cow: 183].If it is said: the appearance of the verse is that it is necessary to be obligatory for the two or the sufficiency.We said: Rather, it is necessary to be a duty of the two people; Because he said: It is for you, that is, on every one of you, as he said: He wrote to you, the one has written on you, the fast is the argument of the one who said: It is sufficient for it to work with it one time, and its saying: It is necessary to specialize this speech with the guidance in that time, except that we say: “We say:“ We say: Al -Qasab [Al -Qarra: 178] The fast is written on you [the cow: 183] The state of the guidance in it is like the one who will find that after that, with the meaning of the seed, which is the same The fact of us, so it is obligatory to remain on the original position, they said: What indicates the validity of this saying is the saying of the Almighty: and all of God is the one who was the one who was the one who was the good.Al -Qaed is a cultivation, as it is a good deed, except that it is said: the imposition was steadfast, then it was copied, except that the commitment of the people to the transcription is from the one who is the same It is permissible, and it also indicates the saying of the Almighty: and the believers would not be repelled all [the repentance: 122] and the saying of the transcription is not permissible, and it is not permissible, and it is not permissible.It is complicated that it is the exhibits of competencies, except that the participants enter the Muslim’s vision, for it is the jihad then the knowledge of all, and God knows best.(P-24) * * * It is that the appearance of his saying: It was written on you that this speech is with the believers, and the mind is also indicated by it; Because the infidel does not order the removal of the infidel, and if it is like that, how can he said: It is a hatred for you, for this is the feeling of the believer, for the sake of God.Obtained; Because the believer is not uncommon for the people of God Almighty and his associate, but he is satisfied with that, loves him and holds it with him and knows that he is his goodness, and in his pleasure.The answer is from two voices: the first: that what is meant is from the hat A hard height on the soul; Because the mandate is a reflection of the obligation of what is in its action, a shame and a hardship, and it is known that the greatest of what the nature tends to the life, so that is the most difficult.The second: That what is meant is their seizure of the fighting before it is imposed for the fear in it and for the many times.Light it; Do you not hate him after being imposed on you.The third question: the hatred is to add enough it is hatred; With his saying: It is possible that you hate something, which is the best for you, then it is in it.؎ But it is an infection and anxiety as if it was his hatred of their overwhelming views of it.The second: that it is a verb in the sense of an effective, such as news in the sense of the informant, that is, and it is a compassion for you.And the peace be upon the conquest, and they are two languages, such as weakening and weakness, and it is permissible to be in the sense of being on the way of the metaphor, as if they were forced to him; Because of their desire for him, and his hardship on them, and from him the words of the Almighty: His mother carried him as a kara and put him in his kaur [15].And some of them said: Al -Karah, by the guarantee what you have seen from what you did not deny to it, and if it was in his mind, then the conquest.As for his saying: May you hate something and it is better for you and perhaps you love anything and it is evil for you, and it has books: the first question: may he do the same And it is said from him: I have a day, and I have said: So, may you do?Zoid, and its meaning: near, he said: Say: May it be a response to you [Al -Nammel: 72], meaning near, and he said: May it be more, so that it is a good.The resurrection of Zaid.* * * The bitter immediately; To sign the validity The argument of the profit in the future, and the goodness of the hardships in order to seek knowledge to the goodness with great happiness in the world and in the holy, and here we are like that; And that is because it is left to jihad, even if it is already beneficial to the soul of the soul, and the money of the money from spending, but there are types of harms, from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the same And the tranquility intended your country and tried to kill you; Either he takes you and suggests your blood and your money, or you need to fight them without preparing a machine and weapon, and this is the killing of the height of the disease in the first place in the first place The breath of the soul is carried out the release of the medicine, then at the end of the matter, the woman becomes obligatory to bear the weakening of that alienation (P-25), and the hardship, and the hardship, For the sake of security, and that is better than the integrity of the time of time, and from it and the affliction of the sheep, and it is the great eruption in the seizure of the performance.As for what is related to the religion, there is a lot, including what is obtained from the great reward, if the jihad is a closeness and worship, and the way is the way of the righteousness, then it is not.Your enemy is afraid that you will seek to seek you, so you will not be patient with the insult, and you will be used from religion, and it is that if your enemy sees your grandfather in your debt and with your soul, you are in your religion In the cause of that to your religion, then if you convert to your hands, you will make it because of that, who deserved to the great reward for God, and from it that the one who has been blessed is the one who is the best The murder may be borne by seeking the pleasure of God, and the man did not associate a mastery of the preference of God and his mercy, and that he does not waste the reward The world is false things that are not satisfied with the killing, and when it was like that, the world of the world has left the love of God and the hatred of the world, and that is one of the greatest of the people of the human being.She proven what we mentioned that the pride and even if the fighting was distracted from the best of God, then it is a lot of good and the one and the one, and it is known that the two things are when it is a ritual, so it is the most.What is meant is from his saying: May you hate something, which is better for you, and perhaps you love something, and it is evil for you.The third question: evil: the bad, and its origin is from the evil of the thing if it was simplified, it is said: the evil of the flesh and the wip, if it was simplified to dry, and from it, and from it: It was referred to as the crushing and the evil: the flame; For his simplicity, he is on this: evil is the same as harmful things.* * * The loyal question: (maybe) is the illusion of suspicion like (perhaps), and it is from God, the exalted, and among them is a person who said: It is a word that is inherent, so it does not indicate that the shadow is not.It indicates that the suspicion is made to the listening, and on this estimation does not need to be interpreted, but if we say that it is in the sense of (perhaps), then the one is in it.The reminder in his saying is up to the Almighty: Perhaps you will fear [the cow: 21] Al -Khalil said: (Perhaps) from God and it is obligatory in the Qur’an, he said: So God will come to God: [52] He was found, and God may come to me all [Yusuf: 83] and he was obtained.And God knows.As for the saying of the Almighty: God knows that you do not know, so what is meant by him is the great desire in jihad; And that is because if a human being, if the shortcomings of the knowledge of himself, the knowledge of the knowledge of God Almighty, then know that he is the one who commands the servant, except for what is in it, except for what is in it.He cut off that the one who commanded God Almighty has his compliance with him, whether it was a deed for the pride or that it was not, as if he said: Oh, O servant, who is the servant of the servant, You are inactive of my obedience and do not turn to the necessity of your nature, for this is the verse in this place, the course of its saying is done in the answer to the angels, I do not know what I know.
