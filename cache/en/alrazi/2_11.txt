The Quranic researcher, as well as his words: In their hearts, there is a disease, so I know that the disease is a row that requires the occurrence of the warning in the verbs that are from the place With the heart, it is the knowledge of God Almighty and His obedience and his servants, so if he falls into the heart of the characteristics of what has become forbidden from these effects, these attributes were diseases, so that the rituals of the hearts of the heart, then the rituals of the hearts, then The increase is from the gender of the more, and if it was intended from the disease, this is the disbelief and the ignorance, then it would have been said: God increased them with the sickness of the one who is the same God is an effective act of disbelief and ignorance.The disgraced said: It is not permissible for God to be exalted from the act of infidels and ignorance of Wajah: one of them: that the infidels were in the absence of the ritual on the sake of the sacrifice The meaning is that, they said to Muhammad ﷺ: If God does the disbelief in us, then how do you command us with faith?.And the second: It is up to him, even if it was an act of disbelief, to be accompanied by the cramping of the miracle on the hand of the liar, so he would not have remained as a pilgrimage, so how can we do it.And its interpretation.And the third of them: He is the Almighty mentioned these verses in the exposure of the defamation of them for their disbelief, so how to blame them for something that he created in them.And its elevation: His saying: And they have a painful torment, so if God Almighty created that in them, as they created their color and their length, then what is the sin of them until they are tortured?.Fifthly: He is the Almighty, he added to them by saying: What they were lying and on this and attributed them to the exalted that they were spoiled in the land, and that they are the sins, and that they are the sins, and that they are the sins, and that they are the sins.I am with you.Because it is said that my heart is said of such an order, and the meaning is that the hypocrites were satisfied with their hearts when they saw the steadfastness of the Prophet’s command ﷺ and the day of it, and the day of the day, and the day of it, The disappearance of their heads, as it was “it was narrated that peace be upon him, he passed by the servant of God, the son of Abi, Ibn Salaoul, on Harmar, so he said to him: And some of the supporters said to him: Excuse him, O Messenger of God.God (p-59), so he said: God increased them, meaning that God increased them with a cloud of their clouds with what is more in the upstream of the Prophet ﷺ and the most of his affairs.The second: that their disease and their disbelief used to increase due to the increase in the costs, so it is like his words, the exalted in the surah of the repentance: so they increased their obsession with the authority of the authority of the authority: 125] You did not do that, but when they increased, we would go down when they were removed from what they disbelieved in it, it was said that, and he said it to a story of a story that is a story, for the sake Da’i is more likely to be uninfected [Noah: 5, 6] and supplication He did not do anything of this, but they have been fierce with him, and he said: And among them are those who say me and do not fascinate me [Al -Tawbah: 49] and the Prophet is the peace of God.He fascinates him, but he was fatal at his time, so the temptation was attributed to him and to increase many of them, what was revealed to you from your Lord, and God: 64] A vow came to them, which increased them, except for an alienation.The hypocrites when they were disbelievers, then God called them to the bike of his debt, so they disbelieved in those parties and increased by that, as a disbelief, not a crime that is added.The third: What is meant by his saying: God increased them, the disease that is forbidden from the increase in the kindness, and it will be because of that prevention, and it is like a saying: [Existing: 4].The four: The Arabs describe the light of the part of the disease, and they say: a running neighbor.Jarir said: ؎ The eyes that are in its part are a disease that killed us and then did not revive our killing, so so the disease is here, but it is the mortal in the intention, and that is the matter, and that is because it is the matter, and that is the intention, and that is because it Their hearts are strong on the struggle, the dispute, and the purification of the peculiarities.Performing, that is, they increased them, that is the crusher, the cheese, and the weakening, and God has fulfilled the Almighty with his saying: He threw their hearts in their hearts, and they will be broken.The believers [Al -Hashah: 2].Fifth: That the disease be carried on the heart of the heart, and that if a person becomes watered by envy and hypocrisy and the view of the deceased, then if it is for him, then it is for that, then it is for that The heart and hurt it, and the sake of the memorizer on this face is a pregnancy for him on his right, so he was the first of the paths of the faces, but his saying: and the one who said: Perhaps a day, as a painful and a goodness, and the torment was described by it, so it is the same as his saying: a greeting between them is a warning and a good, and this is on the authority of the one who said: And the mother is in the truth of the student, as the grandfather is for the good, but his saying: what they were lying in his research, one of which is that the falsehood is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the news He calls him a lie, unless the expert knew as the expert from him, contrary to the news, and this verse is an argument for it.And the second: that his saying: They have a painful torment of what they were lying.Ibrahim, peace be upon him, lied to three lies, so it is intended to be broken, but when the image of the lie was called.And the third: in this verse Two readings: One of them: they lied and what is meant by their lies is his saying: God and the last day and what.And the second: “they lie” from its lies, who is the opposite of its charity, and from the lie who is exaggerated in a lie, as it was emancipated in the honesty of the righteousness.(P-60) And if it is said to them, do not spoil the earth, they said, but we are reconciled, except that they are the spoils, but they do not feel the saying of the Almighty: If they say: But we are reconciled, except that they are the spoils, but they do not feel, I know that this is the second type of the doves of the hypocrites, and the words of it: It is said: Who is the one who says do not spoil the earth?.And the second: What is corruption in the earth?And the third of it: Who is the one who said: We are we are reconciled?And its lord: What is the righteous?As for the first question: Whoever said: That is the one who said, God is the Almighty, and among them is those who said: He is the Messenger, peace be upon him, and among them is those who said: Some of the believers, and all of you, Thus, those who do not specialize in religion and advice, and if the closeness is that the one who says to them is those who have seen them with that, so that the Messenger is upon him, peace be upon him, and the peace be upon him.Thus, they advised them, and they answered what is achieved by their faith and that they are in the righteousness of the household of the believers, or if it is said: Some of those who were lying to him were not from them, and he was not the same He turns and preached to them, saying to them: Do not spoil, if it is said: What are they telling the Messenger, peace be upon him?We said: Yes, the hypocrites were if they were raised, they returned to the emergence of Islam and the denomination, and they lied to the carriers of them and they were allied to God, as he told them, as he told them, as he told them.They are solved by God, what they said, and they said the word of the disbelief [the repentance: 74] and he said: They are solved for you to satisfy them [the repentance: 96].The second question: Corruption is the abandonment of something from its being, benefiting from it, and its arrest is the righteousness, but it is a corruption in the land, so it is the same Sayings: One of them: the saying of Ibn Abbas, Al -Hassan, Qatada and Al -Saddi: that what is meant by corruption in the land is the purification of the disobedience of God Almighty, and his reports is what he mentioned.The demonstration of the disobedience of God is the Almighty, but it was a corruption in the earth; Because the bouquet is Sunnah, a place between worshipers, then if the creation holds it with it, the aggression is removed, and every one is still, then the blood was injected, and the blood was made.The earth and the goodness of its people, but if you leave the seizure of the parts and provide every one on what it is distorted, the ritual, the arrogance and the obligatory, and the one who said: To spoil the earth [Muhammad: 22], he alerted them that if they were exposed to obedience, they would only get corruption in the land with it.And the second: to be said: that corruption It is the display of the hypocrites for the disbelievers and their mixture with them; Because when they did not tend to infidelity with the phenomenon, they are believers, or that is the weakness of the Messenger ﷺ and his supporters weakened, and that was the disbelief of the disbelief on the authority Warm for him and their hearing in dominance, and there is a great corruption in the land.And the third of it: The deaf said: They were calling in the secret to his lie, and the numbness of Islam, and the liking of the suspicion.The third question: Those who said, but we are reconciled to the farmer, and the closest in their intention is that we are an offense for what they were forbidden, so what was it, so what was the one who was forbidden by him Corruption in the land was their saying: We are reconciled, like the opposite to it, and when they appear, they appear: one of them: they are in the religion of the religion, and it is that it is the right thing.They seek for the sake of strengthening that religion, they do not say: We are reconciled; Because they are in their beliefs, they did not seek to purify the face of the earth from corruption.And secondly: If we are pleased, do not spoil the directors of the hypocrites of the atonement, then say: We are reconciled with it, meaning that this is the one who is in the right.The Muslims and the infidels, and that God has told them to say that they said: If we wanted only charity and success [Al -Nasa: 62], then they said: We are the ones who are praying We are ourselves.And know that the scholars have inferred this verse on the fact that those who showed faith must be conducted by the rulers of the believers on it, and the convergence of his disagreement does not give it to him Acceptance, and God knows.* * * As for his saying: except that they are the spoilers, they are unaware of three faces: one of them: that they are spoiled; Because the disbelief is a corruption in the land, as it has the infidels of the grace of God, and the feet of every one on what it is.Because if he does not fear the existence of God, and does not hope for reward or punishment for the people, and from this it has proven that the hypocrisy is a corruption; And for this, he said: Did you see if you were spoiling the earth on what its report came.
