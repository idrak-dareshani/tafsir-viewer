The Quranic researcher is the third judgment of the legal rulings removed from this position from this surah, the verse of the periods.O you who believe, if you condemn a debt to a name, then write it, and write among you a writer with justice, and a writer does not refuse to write it as a writer, so he will write it And let him pray for the truth, and may God fear his Lord, and do not underestimate anything from him, for if the one who has the right is his sorry or weak, or he does not be able to do so With justice and martyred two martyrs from your men, if we are not two men, a man and two of those who are satisfied And the martyrs do not refuse if they are called and do not seek to write it as young or old for it, for that It is present that you turn between you, so there is no ward to you that you will not write it and testify if you are creative and no writer or martyr is harmed, and if you do, then you will do it, and they will be done And God has everything that is knowledgeable, I know that in the verse there are questions: the first question: that in the Keviyyah of the systems and Jahin: The first: that God is the one who is mentioned by this.Judgment: One of them: spending in the path of God, and it is necessary to cut money, and the second: the absence of usury, and it is also because of the purification of money, then it is the Almighty, the one who is the one.And he said: Fear a day in which you will return to God and piety will be brought to the human being more than the gates of the attributes and the benefits.Corruption and Board; The ability to spend in the path of God, and on the leaving of usury, and on the obligation of piety (P-94) is not completed and completes only when the money is obtained, then it is the one who is up to the sake of this He gave in the commandment to keep the permissible money from the faces of twisting and wrapped, and his counterpart was returned in the surah of the women, and do not pay the fools of the mothers of the one who made God the one who made God: On the authority of the money in the matter of money to be the reason for the reconciliation of the pension and the restoration, the cloth said, may God have mercy on him: The one who indicates that is the righteousness of the Qur’an, In this verse, there is a simplicity, not to see that he said: If you have a debt to a name named, then write it, then he said secondly: Let him write between you, and he said: A writer to write as God taught him, so this was like the repetition of his saying and to write among you a writer with justice; Because justice is what God has taught, then he said a rappel: (Let him write) and this is the return of the first matter, then he said fifth: He will be filled with the one who has the truth, and in his saying: A clearer of justice A sufficiency of his saying: He will be filled with whom the right is to be borne, because the writer is just as he writes what dictates to him, and then he said, and he said: “And he will not fear God.Following: Nothing is something from him, as this is like the one who benefits from his saying: May God fear His Lord, then he said eighth: Do not be guided to write him to a young man Consumer for what he went, then he said nine: that is the best of God and I am resisting for martyrdom and the lowest that you will not be disciplined, so mention these three benefits, and those who are the three.That indicates that when he urged what is going on a course, because of the fact that the money in the first two rules is made in this judgment in the commandment, with the money of the money, and the permissible money, Let the human being able to spend in the way of God, and the symptoms of the disbelief of God from usury and otherwise, and the perseverance of the strength of God, then this is the one who is the one who is the first Good kind.And the second face: that a people are among the interpreters, who said: What is meant by the peaceful periods, for God is His Glory to Him and Him, and what prevented usury in the verse in the ears of the name With the fact that all the benefits that are required of the usury are in peace, and for this, some of the scholars said: No, no, no, or a benefit that is connected to it with the ritual of the ritual To get the same as the pleasure of a halal way and a hidden way, this is what is related to the face of the system.The second question: the wealth is a reaction from the debt, and it is some of you, some of you, and you will be seen by the body, the people of the language said: Because the loan is that the human being lends to be dictated, or a love, or a love, or a dates, or what is like that, and it is not permissible for the sake of the larger and the debt in which it is permissible for the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake, and it is permissible.I was fully uploaded to a sake, and he condemned it if he lends, and it is close to it, and the redness of the redness: We say: In the intended of this period, it was said: Ibn Abbas said: It was descended in the predecessor; Because the Prophet ﷺ came to the city while they were shed in the Sunnah and the three, so he said ﷺ: Then God Almighty defined the costs of the faces in the whole, weighing, and later, so he said: If you redeem you with a debt to a name named, then write it.And the second saying: It is the loan and it is weak because we have shown that the loan cannot be involved in the larger, and the debtor is removed in the verse that has been involved in it.And the third saying: It is the saying of the most interpreter: that the sects are on four of the faces: one of them: the eyes of the eye with the eye, (P-95) and that is not The bit.And the second: The religion is sold in the religion while it is invalid, so it is not inside this verse, the rest of here is a sect: The debt is in the eyes, which is the name of peace, and both of them are inside this verse, and in the verse as questions: the first question: the duration is a reaction, and it is true that it is from it A debt, and that is the banner of the debt with the debt, and it is invalid with agreement.The answer is that what is meant by your hand is treated, and the appreciation: if you are treated in what is in it.The second question: Its saying: You will show the debt, so what is the benefit of his saying is a debt?The answer is from the faces: The first: Ibn Al -Anbari said: The time is for two meanings, one of whom is: the wealth of money, and the other is the time in the sense of the reward, from the meaning Parents of the part, so God mentioned the dome of the debt to summarize one of the two meanings.The second: The owner of the “scout” said: He mentioned the debt to return the guerrilla to him in his saying: So write it when he did not remember that, then he would have said: The systems were not with that good.The third: It is the Almighty to mention the affirmation, as the Almighty saying: The angels were glorified all of them all [the stone: 30], and there is no bird that turns in its wings [38].The lord: If you have any debt, it was young or old, on any face, from the loans, peace, or sale of an eye to a sake.Fifth: What is wrong with the Babals that we mentioned that the ducts are a reaction, and that is what the religion is seen in the religion while it is invalid, so if he said: If you will come to me The debt is in the debt and it is invalid, but when he said: If you come with a debt, the meaning is: if you redeem, you will come to one debt, and then the one who comes from With the two parents, and the eyes of the eyes remain in the debt, or sell the debt with the eyes, then the one who has each of them is one of them, one debt, not not.The third question: What is meant by the verse: Whatever you come with a debt, then write it, and the word "if" the general does not benefit, then he said: You did not say?The answer: that the word “if” and if it does not require the general, it is not prevented from the general public, and here the evidence rose that what is meant is the general; Because it is the Almighty to show the matter in the matter of writing in the last of the verse, and it is his saying: that is the most important of God and the most lowering of the martyr And he was not written, so the back is that he forgets the entity, so that the increase was delusional, so he demanded the increase, which is injustice, and perhaps the deager, and the sake of the sake of it, did not But if he wrote the entity of the security of these warnings, when the text indicates that this is the cause, then that This is a standing in place, and the judgment was also in all.As for the saying of the Almighty: to a name named, in it two questions: The first question: What is the term?Answer: The term in the language is the harmful time for the elimination of the term, and the sake of the human being is the time to spend his life, and the sake of the debt is a certain time in the one who is in the way Delay, it is said: the time of the thing is forced if it is delayed, and the term is urgent.(P-96) The second question: The periods are only evident, so what is good is in the male of the sake after the remembrance of the duration?The answer: Rather, the term is mentioned so that he can describe him with his saying (name) and the one in his saying: (Memory) so that he knows that it is the right of the sake of the sake of being With the Sunnah, the month, and the days, and if he said: to harvest, or to the anals, or to the pilgrim’s resurrection, it was not permissible for the name of the name.* * * As for his words, he said: He wrote it, so know that he is up to the end of the two things, one of them: the writer, and it is the saying of it, so we wrote it: the second: Two martyrs from your men and in which two issues: the first question: the benefit of writing and stress is that what is in which the larger enters, the delay in it is delayed in it, and the request is delayed in it, and it will be made.Jahid, the book is like the reason for keeping money from the two sides; Because if the debtor has known that his right has been restricted by writing and stressing, he warns of the request of Ziadah, and from the applicant for students before the solutions He warns about the pity, and takes before the sake of the wandering in the acquisition of money, to be able to perform the time of the debt, so when it was obtained in the book and the wise of this, this is not the same God commanded him and God knows.The second question: those who say that the apparent matter to the delegate is not a matter of them in this With the beard, which is the giving of Ata, Ibn Jarraj, and Al -Nakha’i, and the choice of Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri.Mawlul at the scar, and on this, the jurisprudence of the jurisprudence is the diligent, and the evidence is upon him that we see the gathering of Muslims in the whole of the path of Islam.Unfortunately, there is no writer, and that is a gathering of their answers, and because in their positive ones, the greatest tension on the Muslims, and the Prophet ﷺ says: “ The glimpse of “people and a people said: Rather, it was a duty, except that it became a fool with his saying, then some of you are safe, so let him lead the one who believes in the one who is safe.” Al -Hassan, Al -Sha’abi, Al -Hakam and Ibn Ayna, and Al -Tayami said: I asked the good about it and said: If he wants to test Hope: If some of you are safe and know that he is up to what he had written, this is a matter His saying: Let a writer write among you justice and know that his saying is up to the Almighty: (So write it).It is possible, so that human being is not a writer, so the meaning of his saying became: (So write it), that is, it is necessary to obtain this writing, and it is like the saying So they cut their hands as a reward [Al -Maaidah: 38] If it appears, and if it requires the discourse of all of this action, we know that the intended is from it that it is not from it that there is no one from it.One person, either the imam, or his deputy or the mour, so this is then that this is confirmed by this, which we said with his saying, “Let him write between you, so that he is a good man.The intended is the case of this writing from any person.And he writes it in terms of the pilgrimage to him.It is necessary to write it in terms of each one of the two characteristics safe from the one who can be able to do the other.He has among the people of science and does not be in terms of a judge from the judges of the Muslims, as a way to his heights on some of the two Muslims.The sum of the conflict that is intended for it, and these things that we have mentioned cannot be sponsored unless the writer is a disobedient, and he is a disobedient, and the one who is a good thing Distinguished among the likes.About the abstinence of writing, and the affirmation of writing on everyone who was a writer, in which there are faces: the first: that this is on the way of guidance to the first, not on the path Writing, and honored it with the knowledge of the legal rulings, for the first one is to write a crime of their brother, his Muslim brother God is good for you [Al -Qasas: 77], for people will benefit from his writing, as God benefits him by learning it.He finds one who is written only by one, and it is necessary to write on it.With his words, it is not harmed A writer and no martyr.And the righteous saying: that the attachment of the positive is to be written as God has taught him, it means that he is able to write, so the duty is to be written on what he knows, and that he does not know what he knows, and that he does not know what he knows Breasts, and there is no need in which he is broken by the meaning of the human being, and that is because if he wrote it from other than taking into account these paths, he was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who did not.To him: If you write, write it about justice, and to adhere to all the bases that God has adopted.The second question: His saying: As God has taught him, they are in it: the first: to be attached It is not possible for him to write other writers that God taught to it, then he said after that: Let that write that God taught him.The second indifference: that it is attached to what is after it, and the ability: a writer does not refuse to write, and here the words were fulfilled, then he said after him as he knows, then he knows that The first is a matter of writing, and then he added it to the matter of the writing that God taught it, and the vags mentioned the gospel.* * * The second condition in the book: His Excellency said: Let him be filled with the right and in which there are two questions: The conditions and records, but that is only fulfilled by the righteousness of those who have the right, so let him enter the sentence of his mother, whose condolences are with what he has in the right to the right and his righteousness and his right So, for that, for that, the Almighty said: Let the right to the truth.The second question: the imams and the elderly are two languages, the Farah said: The book is upon him the language of the people of Hijaz and the sons of Asad (P-98), and I have a language of Tamim, In the two languages, he said in the second language.* * * Then he said: May God fear His Lord and do not underestimate anything from him, and this is a matter of this mortality, which the right has to be approved by the money of the money that is not upon him.* * * Then the Almighty said: If the right of the right is, he was weak or weak, or it is not possible to tire of him, so let him be filled with justice and the meaning that the one who has to do so is the one who has to be.Advisable, the one who is considered is a declaration and for it.Then in the verse: the first question: the introduction of a letter “or“ between these three westering, meaning the shed, and the weak, and whoever cannot be overwhelmed by it.Againing; Because it is meaning that the one who has the right if it is described by one of these three attributes, let him be filled with justice, so it is necessary for the three to be in the three, then it is necessary for it to be.The luxury was carried out on the weak The opinion is deficient in the mind from the two idols, the weak over the young, the madness, and the sheikhs, who are the ones who have lost the mind in the kidneys, and the one who does not He weakens his tongue from the rituals of a devotion, or ignorant of his money and what is on him, for all of these are not valid from them, the righteousness and the declaration, so it is necessary for them to do so.Let him be filled with justice and what is the one of the three of these three, because the guardian of the shed, and the boy: He is the one who decides on him, as is the one who decides with him.His affairs, and this is the correct saying, and Ibn Abbas and Muqtiq and the Lord said: What is meant by his guardian and the religion of the religion means that the one who has the religion is full and this is with me.Because it is how he accepts the saying of the claimant, and if his saying is considered, then what is the need for us to write and martyrdom?* * * The second type: One of the things that God has expressed in the category is the martyr The custody of you can be able to testify with the pity from the connection to the acquisition of the truth, and in the verse the issues: the first question: The man, and his martyrdom in meaning, and the two martyrs are the two witnesses, so it is an effective sense.The second question: the addition in its saying: from your men in it in it: the first: it means from the people of your fullness and they are the Muslims.The second: Some of them said: It means free.And the third: (from your men) who are accustomed to the testimony of the same.The third question: the rituals of the martyrdom are many mentioned in the books of jurisprudence, and we remember this one of the one: which is that it has a sheriff and a son of Sir and Siri The testimony of the servant, and when Al -Shafi’i and Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with them, do not allow them, the Hajj of Sherih is that his saying is up to the Almighty: and they are martyred from the two men of the year And others, and the meaning that is beneficial from the text is also indicative of it, and that is because the mind of the human being and his religion and his equivalent is prevented from the lie, so if it is a witness, then if it is a witness to it The bodies are confirmed by the saying of the claimant, so that is a reason in the neighborhood of his right, and the mind and religion and the equality are not different from the reason (p-99), the freedom, and the freedom, and the freedom, The testimony of the slave is an acceptance.The Hajj Al -Shafi’i and Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with them, said: The exalted: The martyrs do not refuse if they are called, then this requires that it is obligatory to everyone who was a witness to the one who is a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who is a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was a witness to the one who was the one who is the one who was a martyr The testimony, and the promise of the goat is forbidden to perform the testimony, so when the verse indicated that everyone who was a witness was obligated to go and consen That the servant will not be a witness, and this is a good.* * * As for his words, he said: And martyred two martyrs from your men, so we have indicated that some of them said: and martyred two martyrs from your men who are accustomed to the performance of the testimony, and the testimony of this The slave like that?* * * Then he said: “If they were not two men and two men, and in the reaction (one of two men and two days), four are the first of the first ages: let you be a man, and two men, and two men, and two men, and two men A man and two women, and the third: the witness is a man and two, and the lord: a man and two women who testify, all of this is a good, good, good.May God have mercy on him.* * * Then he said: Whoever you are satisfied with the ritual and is like his words, the highest in divorce, and testify with the same way Good for martyrdom and jurisprudence, they said: Breasts of the acceptance of the martyrdom are tenth: to be free, in the language, Muslim, just, and a scholar of what he witnessed, and he did not Its souls and do not defend it from itself, and it is not known for the many mistakes, nor by the blessing of the tranquility, and it is not between it and between it.* * * Then he said: If one of them is misled, then the last one is mentioned, and the meaning is that the forgetfulness is the majority The forgetfulness is in the mind of the breasts of the forgetfulness on the one woman, so the two days were established from the one man, even if they are if he forgot, then he is a remembrance of this.The intended from the verse, then there are questions: the first question: read Hamza, "if it is misleading," it is a break, then it is reminded of "raising and stretching, and with it, and it is clear “A reward is misleading, but it is not indicated in the burning,” so he reminds, “Raeda is that no part is a beginner Jahan: One of them: the estimation: to be misled, then the rejectionist is deleted.The second: It is an act of it, that is, the will to be misleading.If it is said: How is this words and the strain of the remembrance, not the misguidance.We said: We are the gaze: The two women are the place of the one man is the justice in the case, and that is only in the misguidance of one of the two women, so if each one of these two things is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one of the two things The woman is intended, and there is no path to that except for the misguidance of them and the last remembrance of the other, there is no crime.The position, and for the two gravies, is the most important of what it is improved and the books are included in it, and God knows.(P-100) The second question: The delusion in its saying: Being misleading themselves in it: The second: that it is that it is lost in the way if it is not guided by it, and the vagina is bound, and Abu Amr said: The origin of the misguidance in the absentee language.The third question: Nafaa, Ibn Amir, Asim, and Al -Kisa’i, “Remember“ Thaddid and Al -Shas, and read Hamza with tension and raising, Umar with lightness and position, and they are two linguists mentioned and mentioned the like, descending and descending, and the tension is more extreme, he said: So, remember And whoever reads the diminishing, he has made the verb aggressively with the wildness of actions.The general public is that this remembrance and the remembrance of the forgetfulness is only what is narrated from Safyan ibn Ayena that he said in his saying: So you remember the one who will be removed from them It is mentioned that the group of the martyrs of the two women is like the martyr of the one man, and this direction is stated by Abu Amr ibn al -Alam, he said: If the woman is witnessed She witnessed her remembrance; Because they are standing in one of one man, and this face is false with the general agreement of the interpreters, and it is indicated by its weakness and Jahan: the first: that the women are not, and it is not the same.With them a man, their martyrs did not reward them, so if it is like that, the second woman did not mention the first.The second face: that his saying: (So you remember) is an interview for what he accepted from his saying: that one of them is misled, and when the misguidance was evident in the forgetfulness, the misfortune was not.The forgetfulness.* * * Then the Almighty said: The martyrs do not refuse if they are called in it: the first question: in this verse, it is guided by: the first - which is the most correct - that it is forbidden for the witness from The owner of the right to her.The second: that what is meant is the testimony of the launch, and it is the saying of a mourning and the choice of the locking The testimony is carried out; Because each of them is related to the other, and in their numbers the loss of rights.The third: that what is meant is the testimony if there is no other.The lord: It is the saying of the gospel: that what is meant by the group of the two things is the one who is first, and the performance is second.And those who say the first saying of his faces: The first: that his saying: The martyrdom does not refuse if they are called, it is necessary to provide them as a shame, and there is no way The testimony, but I was boring, that it did not advance that time, as they are a testimony.If it is said: This is formed by his saying and martyred two martyrs from your men, and so he called him a writer before he was written.We said: The evidence that we mentioned has become a result of the harm in this verse, so it is not permissible to We leave it for the cause of a harm in that verse.And the second: that the appearance of his saying: The testimony does not refuse if they are forbidden to abstain, and the matter of verb, and that is for the obligatory in the right of the whole, and the one who does not know.Everyone, it was not permissible to carry it on it, and the performance after the lowering, then it is obligatory for all, and it is confirmed that it is the Almighty saying: and do not conceal the testimony: [283] The third: that the matter of stress benefits the matter of the witness with some of the faces, so the matter became the testimony of martyr His saying: The testimony does not refuse if they are called to the command to perform a pregnancy for him on a new benefit, so that was the first, and he did not appear in what he mentioned.The witness is not to be able to reside in the testimony if he is called to it.(P-101) Know that the witness is either to be subject, or that there is a lot in them, if it is a subject, it must perform the testimony, and if it is a lot of it, then it is a lot of it Kafaa.The second question: We have explained the significance of this verse that the servant is not permissible to be a witness, so we do not restore it.The third: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: It is permissible to judge the witness and the right, and Abu Hanifa said, may God be pleased with him: He will not be permissible, and the father of Hanif is permissible.God is upset and answered when the martyrs of two men are the martyrs of the man and the two women on those who are aware.And the argument of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, “He ﷺ has eliminated the witness and the right.* * * Know that it is up to what he was at the first time, and then by the second, he returned that time again on the path of affirmation, and he said: You write it as young or old to it, in which it is in it: Writing is less money or much, for the few money in this way is like many, because the conflict that occurred due to the few money may lead to a great corruption In the many and few writing, he said: Do not be guided, and do not dictate, then leave, and then sleep.If it was said: Do you enter the love and the carat in this matter?We said: No, because this is the presumption of the habit, it is not in the habit to write the trivial.The second question: “In the place of the monument for two people: if you want it to make it with the verb, it is a source, then it is destined: and you will not be able to do it The rejectionist is its ability: and do not give it to you to write it for it.The third question: Al -Sadir in his saying: (To write it) and it is necessary and it is necessary to return to the mentioned.The following question: Reading, ”and they do not seek to write it in them.* * * Then he said: “Thus, I have the best of God, and I do for martyrdom, and the lowest is that you do not know, know that God Almighty indicates that the writer is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one: His saying: This is the most descendant of God and in his saying: (That) and Jahan: The first: that it is a sign of his saying: (to write it) because it is in the meaning I take.The second: The lock, may God have mercy on him, said: That is the one who commanded you from the books and the martyrdom of the people of satisfaction and the meaning of the most important of God, and the best of God A source, it is said: the righteousness of the ruling is the ruling, it is a ruling, if it is justice, it is a ritual, and the Almighty said: God loves the assets [Al -Ma’idah: 42], and it is said: The rituals were to Hadim Hattab (Al -Jin: 15), but this was more amended by God; Because if it was written, it was to the one and the honesty is close, and from ignorance and liar a distance, then he was amended by God and he is like his saying: “He pray [Al -Ahdab: 5] That is, amended by God, and I approach the truth that they will be attributed to their parents.(P-102) And the second one: its saying: and the resurrection of the testimony of the meaning (more).The wavy bends.If it was said: What are the sons, do I do the precedence, meaning: I have been and I do?We said: It is permissible for a sacrifice to be two siblings, and it is permissible for us to be more powerful, and I will be more powerful.Know that the writing was only for the testimony; Because it is because of the memorizers and the male, it was close to the righteousness, and the difference between the first and the second is that the first is: it is related to the sake of God By obtaining the reconciliation of the world, but the first was presented on the second, a notice that religion must be presented to the world.The third is the saying: it is its saying: the lowest is that you do not relax, meaning the closer of the disappearance of doubt and clothes from the hearts of the two wealth, and the difference between the first, the first, the first of the two The first two definitions indicate the reconciliation, for the first: a sign of the reconciliation of the reconciliation of religion, and the second: a sign of the establishment of the reference To pay off the soul from the soul and from others, but about the soul, it does not remain in the idea that this matter is how it was, and this is the one who said, was it a righteous or a liar or a liar, or a liar or a liar, or a liar, or a liar, or a liar, or a liar, or a liar, or a liar, Other than that, maybe it is attributed to lies and defaults, so he will fall into the punishment of absence and fading, so what The best of these benefits and what he entered in the installment, and the best of its installation.* * * Then the Almighty said: Unless there is a present merchant that you will turn between you and in it issues: the first question: (except) in it and Jahan: one of them: that it is that It is interrupted, as for the first, he is in the first and the first time: He returned to his words, the Almighty: If you redeem you with a debt to a nameful term, then write it and that it is for the sake of the good A closeness, and it may be for a long time, when he ordered the writing at the duration, I am excluded from it if the term is close, and the estimation: if you come to me, then you will be in a time The term is close, and it is what is meant by the present and the second: that this is a discretion from his saying: A writer does not refuse to write as he taught him, and the one who is the second is the second Included, cut, and appreciation: if the merchant is present, you will turn it between you, so there is no ward to you that you do not write it, for this is what you are The transgression of the height of the writing and the strain in this type of trading, for the many of what is running among the people, would be among the people.Each one of the two dealers is his right from his owner in that sitting, and there was no fear of unjust, so there was no need for writing and dirt.The second question: His saying: (To be) in it is saying: One of them: that it is from the universe in the sense of the limits and the fall as we mentioned it in the saying of it: Al -Farah said: If you want to make (it was), we are deficient on the name that the name is present, and the news you will turn it, and the ability: except that there is a merchant present.The third question: a reader (a merchant) was read by the setting, and those who are raised, and the readers with the position are on the authority that it was a news, and there is no one in it, and it is necessary for it, The estimation is only that the merchants will be present as the book of the book, and it is the saying of the poet: (P-103) ؎ Bani is a lion, do you know our ways if it is a day.That is, if the day is.And the second: that the estimation is: except that the matter and the matter are a merchant.And the third of it: Al -Zajaj said: The estimation is that the duration is present, and Abu Ali al -Farisi said: This is not permissible; Because the ducts are not a present merchant, and it can be answered by it that the duration if it is to the time of an hour, it is true that it is called by the merchant, then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones The dhimma, on the condition that the dirham in this hour be performed in this hour, that was present and present, and the present, and the readers with raising, the face in it is what we mentioned in the second.Know.The loyal question: the trade is a phrase On the behalf of the money, whether it was present or in the dhimma of the request of the profit, it is said: the man is traded, a merchant is traded, and it is a merchant, and he knows that it is whether it was the same, or it was the same.The merchant is present, and it is said: It is only a present merchant that cannot be carried on its appearance, but what is meant by the merchants is what is traded in it I managed it between them, their treatment in it is a hand, then he said: There is no wing for you that you will not write it with it: there is no harm to you in the leaving of the book, and it is not for you to leave the book, and it is not for you, and it is not for you.The ingredient was the written book on them, and the owner of the right enriches its blessing, and it has proven the disagreement of that and that it is not harmful to them.* * * Then the Almighty said: And testify if you are creative and the most trusted people said: What is meant is that the writing, even if they were raised from them in the merchants, except that the testimony was not raised from them; Because martyrdom without a writer is lightering, and because the need, if you fall into it, is not afraid of the forgetfulness.And know that there is no doubt that the intended one of this matter is guiding to the way of the point.* * * Then the Almighty said: There is no writer or martyr, and he knows that he is enticed to be this forbidding the writers and martyrs on the authority of those who have the truth, but the writer is more The one, but the martyr is that he does not witness or witnesses where he does not get a benefit with him, and it is required that he be forbidden to the right of the right to the right of Or it prevents them from their tasks, and the first is the saying of the most interpreters, goodness, jackets, and murmur, and the second is the saying of Ibn Masoud, Giving and Gaad.He knew that both of the two faces are permissible in the language, but the two directions were carried by the cause The writer and the martyr are the actor for the harm.The second: that its origin is not confused by the opening of the first Arab, so they are the verb with them, which is the harm, and the view of this verse that is presented in this is the one who is said in this The mother is in her son, and we have tightened this.And the readings of Ibn Abbas (and not in confusion) with the purification and the conquest, and the choice of the gospel is the first saying, and he was transmitted to him with his saying, after that, then he said: That is because the name of immorality is the one who warns the writer and whoever refrains from the testimony until the right is invalidated by the whole of the whole of it, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same On the performance of martyrdom and whoever you hold it, it is the sinner of his heart [Al -Baqarah: 283] and the sinner and the evading are bound, and the second said is the second saying That this was if (P-104) was a speech for the writers and the martyr, it was said: If you act, then it is a market for you, and if this is a speech for those who are submitted to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones And God knows.* * * Then he said: And if you do, then it is a market for you and in which one of them is the same: it is impeded that it is carried on this position in particular, and the meaning is what you do.And the second: It is general in all the costs, and the meaning: If you do something from what I have forbidden or left anything from what I commanded you, then what is it for you: Human and obedience.* * * Then the Almighty said: And fear God, meaning when he warned about him, and he is the one who is the one who is the one who is a year, or it is a year, and the meaning is fearful of God in all or his goodness.* * * Then he said: God knows you and the meaning: that he teaches you what is guidance and underlined in the matter He is his grace and the highest scholar of all the inhabitants of the world and the hereafter.
