The Quranic researcher (P-233) [Surda Al-Marsalat], which are five verses; Meccan ﷽ and the messengers are known, as the descriptions are described and the essences are published, so the separators are separate, as the metaphors are a virginity or a vow ﷽ and the messengers are the same And the appeals are a publication, as the separators are a separation, as it is an excuse or a vow; In the verse: The first question: Know that these five words are either that is what is meant by a single gears or different segments.As for the first imams, they mentioned it in it: the first: that what is meant by its families is the angels, so the messengers are the angels who have sent them to God.To deliver the resource to two others.And his saying: a custom in it is a face: one of them: a follower like the poetry, it is said: they came with one, and they are like it as the definition of the hyena; If you look at it.The second: that it is in the sense of the knowledge that is the effect of the denial; For these angels, if they are sent to mercy, then this meaning is in their appearances, and if they are for the sake of torment, then that torment, and if it is not a good Far for the prophets and believers who have come to them from them.The third: to be a source; As if it was said: the messengers are asking, that is, followed.And "Arafa" is on the first point in the first place, and on the second to be an effective, that is: I was sent to the people and the well -known, and his saying is the one who is in the hands of The first: It means that God is exalted when he sent those angels, and they understood their kindness as the wind is described.The second: that these angels are described as the unbeliever spirit, it is said: it is described as the sheet if it exalts it and its people, it is said: a curtain is a stick, that is, it is described as it is, and it is described as it is.The speed, and the war was described as the people, that is, it went with them, the poet said: ؎ He met and the lusts of a mantle who are described by the acceptance (and the one) And the essences are published by them that they published their wings when they were destroyed to the earth, or they published the bodies in the land, or spread the mercy or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, or the torment, They publish the books on the day of the account, which are the books in which the children of Adam, the Almighty said: And we bring out to him the day of resurrection as a book that he received a publication [Al -Israa: 13] The thing that was commanded to communicate it to the people of the earth and spread it in them, and its saying is up to the Almighty: the separators are separately, meaning that they separate the truth and falsehood.And his saying: The masculinity is a male, which means that they are remembered to the prophet, then what is meant by the remembrance is required to be the divorce of knowledge and wisdom, as he said, as he said: In the spirit of his command on the one who gives him his worshipers [Al -Nahl: 2] and it is necessary that what is meant is the Qur’an in particular, and it is his saying: I am the remembrance of it from the moon: And what you were hoped for the book to be given to you [Al -Qasas: 86] This is the lying, even if it is Gabriel, peace be upon him, alone, except that it is permissible to name the one in the name of the one.And I know that you have known that the intended is from the department on the majesty of the division of it, and the honor of the angels and the arrangement of their arrangement: Their perseverance in obedience to God Almighty, as he said: And they do what they command, they do not precede him by saying and they are doing his command.[27] And the second: that they are sections: some of them are sent to remove the gospel on the prophet, and among them is those who send to the young people of Adam to write their business; A group of them with night, and a group of them at night, and among them is those who send the arrest of the sons of the children The sky is to the earth, and among them is the angels who descend every day from the house that is perpendicular to the Kaaba on what was narrated in the news, so this is what is said: Knowing, then the speed of the walking, and cutting the many distances in the easy period, as its saying: the angels and the spirit are brought to it on the day ألْفَ سَنَةٍ [المعارج: 4] ثُمَّ ما فِيها مِن نَشْرِ أجْنِحَتِهِمُ العَظِيمَةِ عِنْدَ الطَّيَرانِ, ونَشْرِ العِلْمِ والحِكْمَةِ والنُّبُوَّةِ والهِدايَةِ والإرْشادِ والوَحْيِ والتَّنْزِيلِ, وإظْهارِ The difference is between the right and the falsehood, due to the landing of that life and the download, and the meeting of the remembrance in the heart and the tongue in the cause of that revelation.And in the sentence, the angels are the ribs between God Almighty and among his servants in the louz of all the urgent and sacrifice, and the generous goodness, the spiritual and the spirit With them.The second saying: that what is meant is one of these five words with the winds of the winds, the chaos of God with the winds of torment that he sent a kraf, that is, a follower of the poetry of the one who said: [Al -A'raf: 57], and we sent the wind [Al -Hijr: 22] Then it is tightening until it expires and the winds of mercy.Between the hands of his mercy [Al -A'raf: 57], and he said: God who sends the winds, then he enriches a cloud, so he will be in the sky [Al -Rum: 48] and it is permissible to say: And the tree on the essence and germination; That is because it is spilled, so the plant is highlighted with that, according to what he said: And we sent the winds to the ulcers [Al -Hijr: 22], so this way is the wind, and the wind is spreading, A sink of faces: one of them: that the winds separate some parts of the clouds from each other.And the second: that God Almighty has raised some of the villages by shedding the winds on it, as he said: As for us, they will be blessed with the scent of a sorrow [Al -Haqaqah: 6], and that is the reason The difference is between the guardians of God and the performance of God.And the third of it: that the different winds of the winds and the formation of the wondrous effects on it from the warden of the clouds and the deposition of the resurrection is to make the creation to those who are obligated to the one who is obligated to the one (P-235) and the duties at the door of his mercy, so the difference will be obtained between the acknowledgment, the denial, the united and the united.And his saying: The stamps are mentioned that the sane person sees the winds of the winds that take off the castles and threw the rock and the mountains and raise the waves - God, so that the winds are as if it was the remembrance of the remembrance, the faith and the servitude in the heart, and there is no doubt that this addition is on the path of the metaphor from the one who is the same This is amazing.The third saying: One of the people who carried some of these five words on the Qur’an, and when I can carry all of them on the Qur’an, the one who said: Including the following verses sent to the tongue of Jabril, peace be upon him, to Muhammad ﷺ, and his saying: Arafa, that is, these verses have come down to all of them The path of survival and connected to the mosques of goodness, as the descriptions are described, so what is meant is that the state of Islam and the Qur’an was weak in the first, and then the bone of the boring of the boredom As if the state of the Qur’an ranked with the captives of the country, the boredom, the religions, and its abundance, and made it a constant falsehood.And his saying: The essences are the one that is intended that the verses of the Qur’an have published the effects of wisdom and guidance in the hearts of the two worlds, with a strange and a west, and his saying: The separation is a difference.Because the verses of the Qur’an are the ones that separate the truth and falsehood, and for that, God called the Qur’an the Qur’an, and its saying: the masculinity is remembrance, and the matter is a matter of it.Because the Qur’an is remembrance, as he said: P.And the Qur’an is remembered, and it is a remembrance for you and your people, and this is a blessed remembrance, and a remembrance of the time: and he said: and it is a remembrance of the one who said: 48], and I remember as he said: Male for the two scientists [Al -Anam: 90], so it appeared that the interpretation of these five words can be the Qur’an, and this is not, and this is not.Owner.The righteous saying: It can also be carried on the mission of the prophets, peace and messengers, who are the people who were sent by the good And well -known, because he does not doubt that they were sent without God except God, and it is the concession of every good and well -known.Then he threatens, glorifies, and becomes in power, such as the wind of winds and essences, publishing what is meant by the spread of their debt, their gaze, and their article, and the separation of the separation of the separation of the separation They separate the truth, falsehood, al -Muhaili, and union.And they command them and search them for it.The fifth saying: that what is meant is that a man may be analogy with the reconciliation of the world, asking for a request for her sacrifice and her rest, in the heart of that, he rejoices in the heart of his heart On the authority of the world and the desire for the servant of the mour, so that the reasons are the messengers, then these messengers have two effects: one of them: the removal of the love of what is only What is meant is from his saying: the descriptions are described.The second: the appearance of the effect of that preacher in all the wounds and the members until he hears only God, and only God will see, and only God is seen, so he is the one who says: When the light of the majesty of God will reveal to him, and he sees it as a supply, and he sees all other things His love, and he does not remain in his heart and his tongue except his remembrance, so he said his saying: the metabolism is remembrance.He knew that this one is the three faces, even if it is not mentioned, but it is a very impaired.As for the second indifference: that it is not intended from the five words one thing, so it is in its faces: the first: what is mentioned by al -Zajaj and the chief of the judge, which is that the three are the three His saying: The messengers are the winds that connect to (P-236) the usual knowledge, and the descriptions “what he considers,“ and the appeals ”what spreads the clouds.As for his saying: The separators are separate, they are the angels who separate between the truth and the falsehood, the solution and the forbidden, with what they bear from the Qur’an and the one who says: The stamps are mentioned that they are the angels that are loaded with the masculinity that is mentioned to the messengers.If it was said: What is the crane between the wind and between the angels until they collect between them in the division?We said: The angels are spirituality, so they were understood because of their kindness and the speed of their movements like winds.The second saying: The first two are the winds, so it said: The messengers are known, as the descriptions are the winds, the winds, and the remaining three are the angels; Because it spreads the revelation and religion, then for that beyhd two effects: one of them: the separation between the right and the invalid.The second: the appearance of the remembrance of God in the hearts and the tongue, and this saying what I saw for anyone, but he also appears to be the appearance The descriptions are a ravine of the second one on the first of the fulfillment of the fulfillment, then the Waw mentioned, and he said: and the enemies are a publication and the rest of the two, the remaining two, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The first is distinguished from the last three.The third saying: It can be said: What is meant by the first two angels, so his saying: and the messengers are the same The torment, and the remaining three verses of the Qur’an; Because it is The truth is spread in the hearts and the souls, and separates the right and falsehood, and the remembrance is delivered in the hearts and the tongue, and this saying is also what I saw for anyone, and it is a one who is a person, and he is the one who has been We mentioned it to me to remember it in it, and God knows.The second question: Al -Qafal said: The face is in the entry of fulfillment in some of what the division was fell in, and the waw in some - based on the original, which is that the family of the family is And the comment, then it was said: He rose up and went to go, so the meaning is that he rose to go, so his arise was a reason for his fear and connected to him, and if he said, he said: A standard of himself does not relate to the other.Then the lock is when this origin is paved, so the words were made on it in this verse with its faces, and it is not inclined Two descriptions of something and the last three are the characteristics of one thing, for the forms of it are false.If you are sent quickly, and that bird is the zero, then the hand is arranged on the sending, so it is not a crime of the fulfillment of the fulfillment.What informs the lion to the messengers, does not immediately become a circular, emerging, but the creation is harmful A crime was not mentioned by the fulfillment that benefits the punishment, but the wow is mentioned, but if the publication obtains the arrangement of the difference between the truth and the falsehood and the falsehood of the right The Sunnah, so there is no crime of mentioning these two things by the ritual of fulfillment, so that he and God knew it was said: O Muhammad, I sent the king to you with the authority Everyone is good, but you do not reassure that we spread that matter immediately, but it is imperative to be patient and the hardships are carried out, then if the time comes, I will make the time of the day.The world and its westernity, and when the spread appears, the difference appears, so the falsehoods of falsehood are weak, and your debt is the religion of the right to appear, and you are overwhelmed by you The Sunnah, and in the incest and on the lengths, and the world becomes full of the remembrance of God, then this is if we carry these five words on the angels, and whoever knows this What he marred in the winds and the bridges of the faces; And God knows.As for his saying: excuse or vow; There are two issues: (P-237) The first question: there are two readings: lightness, and it is the reader of Abu Omar and Asim from the narration of Hafs, and those who read the distress, as well So we do not have a conflict in his universe.The lonely and the gossip, so that it is a source, and the discharge and the slight are two languages, and Abu Ali decided to say the fear and the gossip, and he said: the excuse and the virginity and the virginity and the virginity Like the den of denial and the nickname, then Abu Ali said: It is permissible in the readers of those who say that it is a “excuse” A group of vows, the Almighty said: This is a vow from the first vow [Al -Najm: 56].The second question: in the text three of the faces, as for the value of its universe, a source of virtue: one of them: that it is a verb on the one.The second: that it is an effective for it, and the meaning: the metaphors are mentioned for excuses and warning, and as for the appreciation of his unanimousness, then we are in the case of the case, The metaphors are remembered as they are as far and warned.
