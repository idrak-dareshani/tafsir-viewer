The Quranic researcher said in the special blessings of the children of the Israel, I know that he was glorified and exalted when he established the diligence of the tribute and the prophecy, and the re -is first and then the one who is not the same He followed her with the remembrance of the specials on the predecessors of Jews as a breaking of their stubbornness and their chicken by reminding the righteous blessings, and a tendency to their hearts and their hearts with their hearts The prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ from where it is a news about the absence.And know that they were groaning, reminding them of that blessings first on the way of the bulls, and he said: My son, I will remember my blessing, which I have been blessed with you And he spread on its remembrance of the matter of faith in Muhammad ﷺ and he said: And believe in what I descended as a believer to what is with you [Al -Baqarah: 41] Then he commends it with the remembrance They reminded them of that blessings on the second way of the talism They forgive them, then I add this reminder of the desire to be tempted by his saying: that I preferred you over the world It is permissible for a soul about the same thing [Al-Baqarah: 48] to the other verse, then it was launched (P-28) after that in the number of those blessings on the way of the separation, and the one who is clear, This is the end in the goodness of the syntax for those who want the supplication and the conclusion in the heart of the listening.And when this old has achieved this, let us speak now on interpretation of the help of God.* * * His Excellency said: My family, I remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and fulfilled my covenant, I will fulfill your covenant, and I will see it.The first): The interpreters agreed that the Israel is Jacob ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim and they say: The meaning of the sake of the servants of Abdullah; Because “Asra” in their linguistics is the servant and “Il” is God, as well as Gabriel, and he is the servant of God and Michael, the servant of God.Al -Qaflal said: It was said that “Asra” in the crossing in the sense of a human being, as it was said: A man of God, and he said: Son, my family is a discourse with a group of people, who was the one who was a group of people.Peace be upon him, peace be upon him, in the days of Muhammad.(The second question): The limit of the grace is that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who says: The good is the good, the good, the one who is the one who is the one who said: But we increased this; Because the grace is entitled to thank it, and if it is a dignity, it is not worth it, and the truth is that this restriction is not considered; Because it is permissible for the thanks to the charity, even if it is prohibited; Because the side of the merits is not the right of the sake of defamation and punishment, for what abstaining in their meeting?Do you not see?The immorality deserves the thank you for its general and the disobedience to its disobedience, so why is it not permissible for us to be the matter as well?Let us return to the interpretation of the limit, so we say: As for our saying: the benefit; Because the urban harm is not permissible to be a grace, and our saying: the act on the authority of charity; Because if it was a benefit and the intended of the actor, he used to use himself, and we would not benefit the verb with him as someone who did good to his neighbor to be forgiven, or he wanted him, or he wanted him, or he wanted to do so I feed a lamb that is poisoned to destroy it, and that was not a blessing, but if you are the one who is effective on the purpose of charity, it was a good.If you know the limit of the grace, let us separate it from it.God Almighty said: “And what you have in your grace, and from God [Al -Nahl: 53] Then the grace is on three of the faces: one of them: a grace that is separated by God.And secondly: a blessing that came to us from the side of it other than that, that it created it and created the blessing and enabled it from the year, and he created in it the ability of the year, and his goodness, and his goodness, This is the grace in the truth, too He said: To thank me and your father [Luqman: 14] So he started with himself, and peace be upon him said: “God does not thank those who do not thank the people.” And the third of it: a blessing that has come to us from God Almighty by the mediation of our obedience, and it is also from God Almighty; Because if it were not for him, he would have succeeded in obedience and helped us and guided us to it and removed excuses, otherwise we would not have reached anything from it, so he appeared in this regard from the ritual of the heart.Glory be to Him and Him: And what is with you, from God, from God [Al -Nahl: 53].(P-29) The second height: that the blessings of God Almighty on His servants, which cannot be promised and confined to what he said: And if you count the grace of God, do not count it.[18] Because everything that has been deposited in us from the benefits and the pleasures that we benefit from, the wounds and the members that we use in the mountains of the benefits and the payment of the municipality, and what is the one who created the one who created the one who created It is dedicated to it and inferred from the existence of the champions, and what is found in the world is what the displacement obtains with its vision of the sins, which is not the same as its number, Because the benefit is the pleasure or what is the way to the pleasure, and all of what God has created, as well; Because everything that is entertained is a blessing, and everything that is entertained with it is a means of paying the bush, so it is like that, and who is not a man who is gone to the presence of the present, the present, the present, the present, the present of the present, the presence of the present, no Correct to infer It is on the wise man, so it is a way to its knowledge and its obedience, and they are two ways to the eternal pleasures, so it was proven that all the creatures of his success The slave, and when the minds were limited to the number of things in the least things of the benefits and wisdom, how can it be able to be informed of all the worlds and the rule of the world Hope: And if you prepare the grace of God, do not count it [Al -Nahl: 18] then it is said: If the blessings are uninterrupted, and what is not emancipated is not the knowledge of it in the right of the truth In his saying: Remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and the answer is that it is not ethical in the sense of types and people, except that it is sufficient in the shades of the guns, and that is in the shades of the guns, He who benefits the knowledge of the wise of the wise man.And know that when it was proven that the investigator of praise, the praise and the obedience is not achieved except to communicate the grace, it was proven that it is his pursuit and the Almighty is the one who deserves And for this, he said in the cursing of idols: Do they hear you, when you call, or they will benefit you or harm [Al -Shuara'a: 73] and he said: And they worship from the one without God, and he does not benefit them.He guides the right to follow a mother who does not guide him except to be guided [Yunus: 35].The third perpetrator: that the first of what God has blessed with him is that he created them with life and the evidence is upon him.You are gone, then he will protect you, then you will return to you [Al -Baqarah: 28] He who created for you what is in all the earth [Al -Baqarah: 29] to the last verse, and this is clear that the origin of the blessing; Because he is the first to mention the blessings of the blessings, but he mentioned life, then he is the Almighty, he mentioned the wise man, who is the pleasure The world is the life of the other and the reward.He indicated that all of the sedimentary created and beneficial to it, this is the saying of the disgrace.And the people of the Sunnah said: It is his pursuit of the creatures of the harmony, and there are no symptoms for one of it, and this is called its soul.The righteous plot: the disgraceful said: God Almighty has blessed the costs of the grace of the world and the blessing of religion, and the one between the whole of the religion is settled In religious blessings, because everything was in the fate of the roll, he did with them, and that he did not do, and he would not do it in the capacity, for if it is for the sake He does the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost, and in the world, it is on the saying of Baghdadin in particular; Because they have the patronage of reconciliation in the world, and the Basrin is not obligatory.The people of the Sunnah said: God Almighty created the infidel to the fire and the torment of the last, Then they disagreed that there is a blessing for the infidel in the world?Some of them said: This is a few blessings in the world, when it was a leading to the last of the last in the last, and that was not a blessing on the infidel in the world, for the one who is in the world The benefit that occurred from the eaters of the sweetness is no longer a blessing for what (P-30) was a way to the great release, and this is the Almighty: He does not count those who are unbelievers Because of themselves, we are tired of them to increase sin [Al -Imran: 178] and among them who said: It is up to God, even if it is not blessed on the infidels with the grace of the religion, so he is a good religion The saying of the judge, Abu Bakr al -Baqalani, may God have mercy on him, and this saying is a wicker and his faces are indicated by him: one of them: the words of the Almighty: O people, worship you From your before you, you may fear the one who has made you a butterfly and the sky with a constructive [Al -Baqarah: 22], so he warned that it is obligatory for all his obedience to the time of this And sustenance.Second: His Excellency said: How do you disbelieve in God and you were the mother to the end of it, and this is mentioned in the disposal Yes, what is correct.And the third of it: His saying: My children, I remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you and that I preferred you over the two worlds [Al -Baqarah: 122] and this is a text that is good As the addressee of that is the people of the book and they were from the infidels, and also his saying: My children are broken.The book and the difference may be guided [Al -Baqarah: 53].And all of that is a matter of blessings on the slave.ورابِعُها: قَوْلُهُ: ألَمْ يَرَوْا كَمْ أهْلَكْنا مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِن قَرْنٍ مَكَّنّاهم في الأرْضِ ما لَمْ نُمَكِّنْ لَكم وأرْسَلْنا السَّماءَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِدْرارًا [الأنعام: 6].Fifth: His saying: Say: Whoever saves you from the darkness of righteousness and sea you call it [Al -Anam: 63] to his saying: Then you share [Al -Anam: 64].And its sixth: its saying: And you have enabled you in the land and made us for you in the standards of a little.And if they were not a blessing from God, this would not have a good saying.And the sake of it: His saying: And remember when he made you a breathtaking after a return, and you will be in the land [Al -A'raf: 74] 86] And he said about Moses: He said, “God bless you, and he will give you a god, and he preferred you over the two worlds [Al -A'raf: 140].And eighth: His saying: That is that God did not change the grace that it was blessed with people [Al -Anfal: 53] and this is clear.And the ninth: Its saying: He is the one who made the sun a light and the moon is a light and its destiny House to learn the number of years and reckoning what God created only with the truth [Yunus: 5].And I see it: His Excellency said: And if the people have given us mercy after the harm of their touch [Yunus: 21].Hard: his saying: He is the one who brigade you in righteousness and sea even if you are in the ark and run with them with a good wind and rejoice in it [Yunus: 22] They want to the ground without the right [Yunus: 23].“ And he said: He is the one who made you the night to dwell in it and the day is insightful [Yunus: 67].The third is the tenth: Did you not see to those who have changed the grace of God with disbelief, and their people, the house of Al -Bawar, Hell, they prayed, and the misery of the decision [Ibrahim: 28].The fourth is ten: God, who created the heavens and the earth and has descended from the sky with water, so he brought him out of the fruits, and he was blessed with you, and he will be rewarded for you.[32] The fifteenth: His Excellency said: If you prepare the grace of God, do not count it, the human being is unbelievers.He knew that the dispute in this question is back to the phrase, and that is because there is no conflict in that these things are the meaning of life, mind, hearing, sight, and the types of rituals; Rather, the dispute is that the ideals of these benefits if they get their headquarters, that eternal harms, is it called the name of the name of the grace or not?It is known that this is a dispute in a ferry, and the one who indicates that what the cost does not enjoy is, it is the Almighty, but it created it to be intended in it in the man.His kindness and charity are matters: one of them: His exalted say in Surah (the command of God): The angels are revealed in the spirit of his command to whom he prays: Rather, the messengers are sent, preaching, warnings, and for the sake of the supplication to his hostility and faith in his murmur and his justice, then he said: He said: He said: He created They share [bees: 3] The human being created from a sperm, so if he is a clear, clear [Al -Nahl: 4], then he showed that the servant’s impermissibility with the infidels in it, who is the greatest of the diligent His conversion is from one state to a state, from his sperm, then a relationship, then a chew until he is finished from his brother, his condition, which is his sperm, to the honor of his hearts, and he is the same Then he mentioned after that, the faces of it, and he said: And the doorstep created it for you in a warm and benefits, and who you eat [Al -Nahl: 5] to his saying: It is the water of you: From it is a drink, and there is a tree in which they are descending [Al -Nahl: 10] showing that response to the forefront and the companions of the doctor; Because it is exalted, indicating that the water is one and the dust is one and with that The colors, the dumper, and the narrators disappeared, then he said: And the night and the day are harnessed [Al -Nahl: 12] showing the response to the stars and the companions of the people of the wise And her crying is mocked on a single way on her edge, so she established his chances and attributed to these verses that everything in the world is created for the sake of the time.Because everything in the world is what he seduces the same cost, it is not free from the cost of the cost to him, and he will be rejected by him, so he will obtain it with him, or he will come to him, He will have it for him, and we are the same as the harmful bodies such as life and the drug, so he remembers the looks to them for the types of punishment in the hereafter, so he will be broken from it, and it is conquered by it, The greatest, so you have proven that it does not come out of its creatures from these benefits, then it is his pursuit and the Almighty alerted to the greatness If you count the grace of God, do not count it [Al -Nahl: 18].And the second: His Excellency said: And God crushed a village that was safe and reassured, which is brought to her, as well On the authority of the enemy, it is necessary for them to be the disbelief of its disbelief, because it is a reason for the extermination, and the third: it is said in the story of Qarun: And he said: Did you not see that God has harnessed for you what is in the heavens and what is in the land and the best of your blessings is back and in the end [The incident: 58] And he said: With any of your Lord, you are lying [Rahman: 30] on the way to repeat, and everything in this surah is of blessings, either in religion or in this world, then this is what is attached to this.* * * (The third question): In the special blessings on the sons of Israel.Some of those who know: The servant of the blessing is many and the slaves of the blessing are a few, for God Almighty mentioned the children He reminded them of the blessing and said: So remember me, remind you [Al -Baqarah: 152] So that referred to the grace of the nation of Muhammad ﷺ on the path of the nations.And he knew that the blessings of God be upon the sons of the children of many And give them the servants of the servants as he said: We want to sleep on those who are weakened in the land and make them imams, and we will make them in the lands and we will be in the land of the people and we will be in the land of the people and we have the people.Pharaoh, Haman, and their soldiers from them, were not warning [Al -Qasas: 5].(B) He made them a prophet and an angel after they were a slave to the dome, so your family is their elders, and they inherited them, their lands, their paths, and their mothers, as he said: Likewise, and the poets of them.The great books that were revealed to them by the nation Other than that, as he said: When Moses said to his people, O Yaqam, so remember the grace of God on you, when he made you a prophet and made you angels, and you did not give you no one.[20] (D) Hesham narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: From the grace of God, the Exalted be upon the children of Israel to escape them from the family of Pharaohs, and he will be upon them in the gossip, The one who gave them the stone that was the head of the man watered by what they wanted from the water when they wanted, so if they seek to the water, they raised it, then the water will be given to them, and the water will be given to them.They have at night, and their heads were not disturbing and their clothes were not spared.He knew that he was glorified and exalted, but he reminded them of this blessings for his faces: one of them: that in the sentence of blessings, what is witnessed by the righteousness of Muhammad and the ritual.And the second: that the multiplication of the blessings requires the great disobedience, so those blessings reminded them, so that they warn against the violation of what they were called to the faith in Muhammad and the Qur’an.And the third: that the reminder of the many blessings requires the life of the violation.And the one that is the one that reminds the many blessings that it benefits that the blessing has been specialized among the people of the people with it, and whoever specializes in a lot of blessings, then it is not the same for them, so it is not the same for them.Completing the well -known is better than its predecessor, as if the reminding of the righteous blessings is reassured in the following blessings, and that bond is forbidden from the purification of the violation and the opponent.If it was said: This is the blessing of the addressees, but they were on their fathers, so how would they be a blessing on them and because of the greatness of their disobedience?The answer is from his faces: one of them: if not for this blessing on their fathers, they did not stay, so what was happening this bond, then the blessings of the fathers are as if they were the blessings of the father.(P-33).And the second: that the affiliation with the fathers and God has begged for the blessings of religion and the world, a great blessing in the right of children.And the third of them: The children when they heard that God Almighty summarized their fathers with this blessing because they obeyed them and their symptoms of infidels and the wives in the desire of this Because the child is obligated to imitate the father in the actions of goodness, so this memory becomes a reason for the preoccupation with goodness and symptoms of the evil.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: And fulfill my covenant, I will fulfill your covenant, so know that the covenant is added to the male and female committers, and they mentioned in this era: the one who said: What is meant by all of what God has commanded is not to be specialized in some of the clogs without some and then there are narrations, and one of them is that it is the highest of it, he made it to be a custody of it.Where they are obligated to do their thanks, as the one who is obligated to the covenant and the covenant, and his saying: With the covenant from Where their partnership is that it is not permissible to shake it.Second: Al -Hasan said: What is meant by the covenant that God has taken upon him is the sons of Israel in his saying, the Almighty: And we sent from them the twelve, and he said: And the zakat came [Al -Ma’idah: 12] to his saying: And let us enter the gardens that will run from under it.And the third of it: It is the saying of the philosophers of the interpreters: that what is meant is fulfilled by what I commanded you from obedience, and I have forbidden you from the ticks, and I will give you the best of you Al -Dahhah narrated it on the authority of Ibn Abbas and fulfilled what he said in his words, the Almighty: God is part of the believers himself With his covenant from God, then preach to you, who you sell it [Repentance: 111].The second saying: that what is meant by this covenant is what he has proven in the books presented from the description of Muhammad ﷺ and that he will send it to what was stated in that in the authority of the Lord: And God has taken the charter of the children of Israel [Al -Ma’idah: 12] to his saying: I will disbelieve from you, and I will enter you with gardens that run from the rituals: [12] And my mercy and all anything sought, so I will write it for those who fear and pay zakat and those who are our verses believe in those who follow the Lord They find it written at them in the mourning and the Gospels [Al -A'raf: 156].Their equity, and he said: And when God took the covenant of the prophets, what I came to you from a book and a judgment, then a true messenger (Al -Imran: 81) came to you.And he said: And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, my children, I am the Messenger of God, to you, believing in what is between the hands of the teeth, and a missionary with a messenger who comes from the grace of وقالَ ابْنُ عَبّاسٍ: إنَّ اللَّهَ تَعالى عَهِدَ إلى بَنِي إسْرائِيلَ في التَّوْراةِ أنِّي باعِثٌ مِن بَنِي إسْماعِيلَ نَبِيًّا أُمِّيًّا فَمَن تَبِعَهُ وصَدَّقَ بِالنُّورِ الَّذِي يَأْتِي بِهِ - أيْ بِالقُرْآنِ - I forgave him his sin, and I entered Paradise and made two wages for him, a reward to follow what was brought by Moses, and a path came to him by the children The illiterate is from the child of Asmail, and this is true in his saying: “Those who came to whom the book came before him.What they were patient [Al-Qasas: 54] and Ali ibn Issa said: You believe that in his saying: (P-34), O you who believe, fear God and believe in it.His mercy [Al -Hadid: 28] and his belief also while Abu Moses narrated.Al -Ash'ari on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “Three of the two wages are given two times a man from the people of the book.Difficulty and taught her, so he would know her, and then he grabbed her and married her, so he has two wages, and a man obeyed God and obeyed his master, so he has two wages: The matter as you said, how is it permissible from their collection?The answer is from Wajin: The first: that this science was with the scholars with their books, but the many number did not have the number of them.The second: That the text was a hidden text, not an existing, and the struggle of suspicions and young people in it.The second question: The person preached to it in these books, either that it has been mentioned in these books and the time of its exaltation and the place of its exaltation and the one who is the one Or there is nothing of that, if that text is a pure and replied text in the books that are transmitted to the people of science with frequency, so it would have been blessed with the sake This is a well -known one from the religion of the prophetic prophets.And if the second, that text does not indicate the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ to be analogy to say: that that prevails in it will come after that, after that.والجَوابُ أنَّ الَّذِينَ حَمَلُوا قَوْلَهُ تَعالى: وأوْفُوا بِعَهْدِي أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ عَلى الأمْرِ بِالتَّأمُّلِ في الدَّلائِلِ الدّالَّةِ عَلى التَّوْحِيدِ والنُّبُوَّةِ عَلى ما شَرَحْناهُ في القَوْلِ The first is only the power of this question, but whoever wants to support the second saying, then he answers him by the help of time and place, and the place is not a matter of time Galilee, which is known to every one, but it was stipulated in a hidden text, so it is not a crime, and it is not necessary for him to be known for the harm of the religion peace.Let us now recall some of what came in the books of the Prophet who advanced from Al -Bashra by the oldest Muhammad ﷺ: The first: He came in the first seller from the first of the first traveler.A goodness has an angry with it with a king [from before] God, and he said to her: O immigrant where do you want, and from where did you accept?She said: I am one of my master Sara, so he said to her: Return to your master and reduce her, for God will multiply your agriculture, and your offspring, and you will be blessed And his name is called for the sake of the sake of God that God has heard you With all his brother.And know that the recipient of these words is that this speech came out of the outskirts For God Exalted, and it is known that the hearing and his child were not bound by all of me in the greatest of the world and the greatest nations, nor were they mixed with all of all the way to all of them; Because they were before Islam, counted in the state, and they did not dare to enter into the days of Iraq and the people of the Levant, except for my fear, so when the Islam came to you And the west of Islam, and they mixed the nations, slowed down their country, and the nations mixed them and they did their house, and entered their guidance with the causes of the calamity, so if it was not the same If this mixing of them was for the nations and from the nations, they have a disobedience to God Almighty and the externality of his obedience to the obedience of the Satan, and God Almighty is upon him.And the second: In the sharp chapter, he came ten from the fifth travel: “The Lord your God will establish a prophet like me from (P-35) between you and from your brothers.” And in this chapter, the Lord said: A resident of them is a prophet like that among their brothers, and no man heard my word that he performs from that man in my name, I will take from him.” This is indicated that the Prophet, who is evaluated by God, is not from the children of Israel, just as whoever said to the children of Hashem: He will be from your brother, who is not the imam, Then, the peace be upon him is the brokenness of it, and there was no brother except for the stick, and the piper did not have a son of the prophets, and it was before it, and it was before the peace of it Moses, peace be upon him, be preached to him, and as for the hearing, he was a brother of the crushing and the father Yaqoub, then every prophet was sent after Moses, then it was from Moses, then it was from Moses Peace was not one of them, but it was one of their brothers; Because it is from the hear of the hearing, who is the brother of peace be upon them.If his saying is said: “Who among you” is forbidden to be what is meant by Muhammad; Because he did not rise among the children of Israel.We said: Rather, he rose among them; Because he, peace be upon him, appeared in the Hijaz, and he was sent by Mecca and immigrated to the city, and it has his command.It was about the city in the country of Jews as Khebir and the sons of Qanaka and Al -Nadir and others, and too Muhammad in the Hijaz, then he rose from among them, and also, then if he was from their brothers, then he rose from among them, then it is not far from them.The third: He said in the twenty chapters from this travel: He loved them to the peoples and called for a whole of the heights of the blessing.Because in the severity, he is heard Al -Rami learned in the righteousness of Varan, and he knew that he was dwelling in Mecca.If this is proven, then he says: If his saying: “Glory be to them,” it is not permissible for what is meant to be heard, peace be upon him.Because he did not get a healing of peace be upon him, there is a pride, and there is no gathering of the Lords of the Qadisin, so it is obligatory to carry it on the authority of Muhammad.The Jews said: What is meant is that the fire appeared from the phase of Sinai, it appeared from the first fire of fire, and from the mountains of Varane as well, so it spread in these positions.We said: This is not valid; Because God Almighty, if he created a fire in a place, it is not said that God came from that if that follower follows the location of a neighborhood, and he will come down to that The appearance of the fire follows a neighborhood, and there is no words except from the phase of Sana, so what was not empty, except that it is said: He appeared from Sa’ir and from the mountains of Varane, so it is not permissible for him to come as it is not.Harqa and fire, as this agrees in the days of the Lord, and also in the book Habqouq Bayyan what we said, which is: God came from the phase of Sana and the sanctuary from the mountain of Paran Muhammad, and the earth took off from his praise.The beans of hisor will be like the light, he preserves his country with his glory, the flow of the loads in front of him, and he accompanies the prey of his soldiers, he rose up and wiped the land, On the authority of it, the mountains were destroyed, and the Rawabi and the foresight were destroyed, and the people of the people were visited.And you will be rushed into your cruelty, and the arrows are raised with your command, Muhammad Al -Mawhari ran out of exile and terrifying, raising her hands, leaving and separating, and the sun and the moon stopped from its chapters, and you walked in the lightning of your arrow The earth is angry and the mourning of the nations is a mit.Because you appeared in the salvation of your nation and the saving of the dust of your fathers.We say: “It appeared from the mountains of Varan.Because you appeared in salvation (P-36) your nation and the sacrifice of your Christ.Its appearance is a person who is described by this characteristic, and that is only our Messenger, Muhammad.We said: It is not permissible and the description of God is the highest that he is riding the imagination, and that the beans of his view are like light, and that the feelings are permissible, but the saying: (And to save your Christ), for you are Muhammad, peace be upon him, saved the Christ from the lies of Jews and Christians.And the fourth: What came in the book of Isa'a in the second and ten chapters of it: The dark earth is evacuated and covered with the nations of fog, and the Lord shakes you with an eagerness and shows its dignity to you.You are around you, and they are contemplated, for they are gathered at you, and they perform Hajj and come to you from a country far away because you are the mother of villages, so the children of the country of the country, as if the country is as if And your clothes are decorated with your opinions and the secret when you see that you are pleased and adopted for the sake of the sake that it tends to you with the animal of the sea, and it is forbidden to you A debt, and the people of Sita come to you and talk to the blessings of God and glorify Him The mother of Muhammad is Hamid, “So he went to the stipulation that all the characteristics are all, and it is for me.And he said: “And I spoke to the house of Muhammad, Hamid,” which means that the Arabs were repenting before Islam, so he said: I have no partner for you, but you are for you.Then it became in Islam: God bless you, for your heart, there is no partner for you to your father.This is
