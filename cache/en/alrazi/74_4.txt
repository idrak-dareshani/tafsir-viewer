The researcher is the Almighty: Your clothes are purified and know that the interpretation of this verse falls on four directions: one of them: that it is left to give the clothes.The second: that the clothes are left to the clothes, and it is carried out for the purification of its metaphor.The third: that the clothes be carried on its metaphor, and it will be left to the prudence of its right.And the four: that the two are carried on the metaphor.As for the first indifference: which is to be left to be given to the clothes, and the prudence is notified of his truth, so it is that we say: What is meant is that he is upon him the prayer and peace be upon him.Agshes and dignity, and on this estimation, it appears in the verse of three inflicts: one of them: Al -Shafi’i said: The intended from it is the media that the prayer is only permissible in the clothes.And the second: Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Asim said: The participants were what they had been on their clothes from the spoils, so God commanded it to be exalted.And the third of it: “It was narrated that they were strengthened on the Messenger of God ﷺ Sehs of a sheep, and he was hard on him and returned to his house with two sorrows and he was pronounced in his clothes, so he said: This sorry for the warning.The second indifference: that the clothes of the clothes remain on his truth, and make the purification of its metaphor on its metaphor, for it is the saying: the first: that the one who does not say: So they were palated, and that is because the Arabs were lengthening their clothes and running their bonds, so their clothes were unclean, and because the tire of the one who does not do, but it is not the same The Messenger was forbidden ﷺ from that.The second saying: And your clothes are purified, that is, it is not possible for the clothes that it wears is purified from being broken or forbidden, but it is a place.The third indifference: that the purification is kept on its right, and the clothes are carried out on its metaphor, and that is to be carried to the sake of the clothes of the garments The Arabs did not clean the time for the sake of success, so he commanded him to pray and peace with that cleaning, and it may be made to memorize the clothes from the nose.Antara said: I scattered the deafness of his clothes, that is, his soul.And for this, he said: The generous is on the prohibition (P-170) the fourth: It is that it is carried to memorize the clothes and the prudence of the sake of the metaphor, and the remembrance of this Wooh: The first: It is the saying of the most interpreter: and your heart is purified from the oppressive attributes, and on the authority of Hassan: and your clothes are purified, he said: He said: He is tired of his faces: one of them: that the infidels when they nicknamed the magic, the hardship of that was very much, until he returned to his house and was stuck with his clothes, and he was so And the lack of patience that is required by the misfortune of creation, so he was said to him: arise, so warn and do not carry them with their savings on leaving their warning, but rather good.And the second: It is a darkening of creation with their ethics, so he said to him: Clear your clothes, that is, your heart from their morals, in the definition, the conversion, the liar, the liar.The third: purify your soul and your heart from being determined to stand up to them and insult them to them, then if we are pleased with the verse of this way, then in the way of it, in the way of it The first: To be said: God is upset when he called him at the beginning of the Surah, so he said: O you who are the developed, and the infertility was a dress, and the joke from the clothes, it was said: the purification of your clothes that you are.He wore it on this thinking, severity, and draining from the partnerships.The second direction: that the developed in its formation is interpreted by the prophecy, as if it was said: O you who have been depleted by the prophecy of the purpose Patience, anger, and hatred, for that is not appropriate for this joke, then he explained that by saying: Your Lord, be patient, and know that he carried the scatter The adjectives are permissible, it is said: so that the purification of the jabb is the purity of the stirring, if they describe it with the purity of the criteria, and it is said: So that the desecration of the clothes if it is described by the elderly, who said: A father and a son like Marwan and his son ∗∗∗ If he is in the glorious, he will be paid and visited, and the reason for the good of this is the one who is the first: the first: that the garment is like the one who is the good For this reason, they made the garment as a man from the human being, it is said: the glory is in its garment and the chastity in its wraps.The second: that the majority is that whoever purifies his interior, then he purifies his appearance.The second direction: In the interpretation of the verse that his saying: and your clothes are purified by an order to him with the exclusion from the sins and the visit that was presented before it, and this is before it.Whoever carried his saying: (And we put us from you and your button, which has broken your back [Al -Sharh: 3] The verse.Muhammad ibn Arafa said: The women in the clothes, the Almighty said: They are a dress for you and you are a dress for them [the cow: 187] and this interpretation is distant, because on this direction, it is not good.
