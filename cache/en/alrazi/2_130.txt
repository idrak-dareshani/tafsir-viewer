The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And whoever desires the religion of Abraham except for those who shed his soul, and we have chosen it in the world, and it is in the hereafter for the one who is the righteous (P-63) If the matter of His Excellency, peace be upon him, mentioned his hands from the parties of his parts that he walked with him, and from the building of his house and his command of his God, the Lord of God From the urgency of the reconciliation of his servants and his supplication for the good of them, and other things that are a predecessor in this verse, the wonder of the people who said: Ibrahim and faith in what came from his parts, so he was in the shelter of Jews and Christians and the Arabs of the Arabs, because the Jews are the ones who fell into it and they will come from it and they will come from it.We attribute the Israel, and the Christians, so they have been shattered, and it is not an affiliate from the mother’s side to the Israel, and the Quraysh is that they have received every good in the ignorant of the ignorance of the They call for the book of God, and the Arabs of the Arabs who are the two artists, so they returned them to hearing while they are choosing to the Qahniyan with the hearing of what he gave to the one who gave it to God.When the investigation of all of the prohibitions of peace be upon him, and when you were proven that his premature peace be upon him, he is the one who asked God to send this to the Lord of this He was raised to God Almighty in the argument of this intended, so it is a pleasure from the greatest of his pronunciation and his virtue of his affiliation with the righteousness of peace be upon him, then he is not.The call of Abraham, peace be upon him, and his demanding, with the burden, is not doubt that this is what he deserves to be admired.* * * As for his saying: And whoever desires the religion of Ibrahim, except for those who shed his soul, then he will have questions: I wanted it.And from “the first is the one in the sense of denial, and the second in the sense of the one, the owner of the scouts said:“ Whoever sheds it ”in the place of lifting on the substance from the one who is in the authority of the one who is in the authority You want other than an obligation as your saying: Is it only a more Zuid?The second question: It is a saying that we say that there is a question, which is that what is meant by the mortality of Abraham is the mortality that Muhammad, peace be upon him, came to him, because the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the words The acceptance of this religion, so they do not leave either to be said: This is the deadline of the religion of Abraham in the origins and the branches, or it is said: This is the religion is that of those in the name The prophecy and the sponsorship of the honorary dignity, but they differ in the branch of the bouquets and how the work of the work.As for the first: it is invalid because it is peace be upon him.As for The second: It does not benefit the one who is required, because the confession of the origins means the neutrality, justice, and the honor of the ethical and the restoration does not require the affiliation with the Prophet.He holds this words in this demanding.Another question is that Muhammad ﷺ when he was recognized that Abraham is a woven, and he memorized the mill Also on the authority of Abraham, it is necessary for them to be obligated.And his answer: He is up to him when he narrated from His Eminence, peace be upon him, that he had been destroyed to God Almighty and asked him to send this messenger, and he will be blessed, The meaning is that it is the religion of Abraham, so when he greeted the Jews, the Christians, and the Arabs, as the pioneer, peace be upon him, is attached to his article, and it is obligatory for them to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The one who is required to be granted, peace be upon him.(P-64) The questioner said: The saying is what they have greeted that Abraham asked for the same as this Messenger from God Almighty, but rather praise be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, narrated this.To build me on this narration, it is obligatory for them to be the disobedience to the Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him, so if the prophet does not prove that it is not.The narration, and this narration does not prove that it has not been proven by his prophets, and it is referred to the light while he was falling, and we greeted us that the people are peace of the validity of this This is the narration, except that the Abraham is asking for God to send a messenger from his offspring and the atoms of his hearing, so how is the piece that the one is the one?Perhaps another person will come after that, and if it is permissible for the answer to this supplication, this supplication is delayed with the destruction of a thousand years, which is the time between him It is not permissible to be delayed in the amount of three thousand years until it is the one who is called in this supplication another person except for this person?.The answer to the first question: Perhaps the succession and the Great witnessed this narration, and if not for the Juda and Christians, the Christians were from the most hurry to the one who is in this way Advocacy.And on the authority of the second: that the one who drew in the proof of his prophethood, peace be upon him: the appearance of the miracle on his hands, which is the Qur’an and his confusion about the unseen that he knows only The stories, then this argument runs the course of the affirmative for the intended and the one who is required, and God is the highest.The third question: In the exploitation of his “soul”: The first: because it is an effective, the mighty said: His shed is necessary, and his shed is prepared, and on this one: Its they have been subjected to it, and the origin of the lightness is light, and it has a shed, and the evidence for it is what came in the hadith: “ People “and that if he desires what is not desired by a sane, then he lost a language to remove himself and migrant it, where he has a sacrifice.And the second: Al -Hassan said: Except for those who ignorant of his own and he lost his own, and his right is that he does not want the religion of Abraham except for those who ignored it, so he did not think of it, so he did not think of it One of the effects of the industrialization is on the height of God Almighty and on His ruling, so that this is inferred on the validity of the prophecy of Muhammad.The third: Your soul is his soul and his stay on the authority of Abu Ubaidah.And the four: his soul is lost.The second saying: that its soul is not a verb and mentioned this saying: The first: that his soul is based on the rejection of the rejectionist.The second: He poured on the interpretation of the frequency, and it is a breath of breath, then he added and appreciated it, except the shed, and the remembrance of the soul is a certainty as it is said: What is meant by the exaggeration is in its shed.The third: Reading: (Except whoever sheds his soul) by tightening the fulfillment, then he is up to him when he was judged by the sorry for those who desire the religion of the peace of the Prophet We chose it in the world and what is meant by it, if we choose it for the abuse without the caliph of the creation, and we introduced the mortar that is a gathering of the neutrality, justice, and the part of the rest, and the rest of the sake of the rest.Then the ruling of God was added to him, and God honored him with this title in which the majestic is the majesty of those who received it from the king of the angel of the good Let everyone with a lap and mind be fulfilled that the one who wants to do his mortality is his sorry, and then he indicated that in the last one, he is the great of the house so that he would like it to be like in the same way.That is the house, and it was said in the verse is an estimated, and its estimation: and we have chosen it in the world and the hereafter, and it is for the righteous, and if it is true, and if it is true, if it is correct And late was the first, Al -Hassan said: Who are the ones who are inserted into dignity and good reward for the generosity of God Almighty.
