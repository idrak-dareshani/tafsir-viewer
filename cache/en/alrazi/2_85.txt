The researcher is the Almighty: Then you are killing themselves and removing a group of you from their paths, you will appear to them with iniquity, and the one who will come to you They are forbidden for you to release them God is unaware of what you do, but the Almighty saying: Then you are a problem, because he said: “You are for the present and“ these are the ones who are the ones who are Similar to the same?And his answer is from his faces: one of it: his estimation, then you are these.And the second: its estimation, then you mean these present.And the third of it: that in the sense of which you reached “you kill” and the position of killing a lifetime if it is a news and is not subject to it if it is a link.Al -Zajaj said: And the same in the prayer is the Almighty saying: And what is with your right, Yamousi [Taha: 17] means and what is that of your right.And the sequence of it: these are sure because you are, and the news is “you kill”, and as for his words, you are killed?(P-157) He yourself has mentioned it in it, and it is correct that what is meant is killed by each other, and some of the people were killed for the sake of it, it is said that it was said that it is that it was said that it is that it was said that it is that it was said that it is that it is that it was said that it is that it was said that it is.Everyone in the same soul is the same and we have been intended for the exit of the current.As for his words, the Exalted: You appear to them with iniquity and aggression, and it has questions: the first question: Read Asim, Hamza and Al -Kisa’i.By stretching, the direction of the lowering is the one who is the one who said it: and do not return [Al -Ma’idah: 2] and the direction of the tiredness of the tuning of the time in the shadow: The deletion is lighter and the slurring is the same.The second question: Know that the backs is the time, and when the lame was from the home and killed one, some of what the temptation is greed They did that they did it on the face of the use of those who appear to be against injustice and aggression.The third question: the verse indicates that the injustice is as forbidden, so the support of the oppressor on his injustice is forbidden, for if it was said: Is it not the oppression He removed the obstacles and the inhibits, and the lust for the darkness was overwhelmed by the darkness.God is exalted, and the answer is that it is the exalted, even if the oppressor has enabled it to be imprisoned from the darkness with the supplies and the dirt, with the disagreement of the one who has the shadow of the shadow, so it is the shadow of it.He improves him in his eyes and invites him to him, so the difference appeared.The following question: The verse does not indicate that the destiny of the sinner is like the destiny The promise, if it was obtained with the without the monster, would not affect the injustice, and if the mourners would get the bid of the enemies, we would have come to the lap, so that the lamb, so that we did not know.The deprivation of insult.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: If you come to you, you will benefit them.It is only a thousand people in them and the rest: “I seek a thousand and“ you redeem them ”with a thousand and“ the captives ”is a prisoner as a hurry and a wound, and in the captivity of the people: Kaskari and Dakari.The second: a group of a prisoner, and Abu Omar separated between the captives and the captives, and he said: The captives who are in a trust, and the captives who are in the hand, as if he goes until he is a woman That is, and Ali ibn Issa said: The choice is a one who has a thousand because he has the most of the imams, and because it is evidenced by the sense of gathering, when it was said in a lot of one, and it is in it, and it is in it.And because it is the language of the people of Hijaz.The second question: they benefit them and benefit them two famous languages ​​that benefit them from the redemption, which is the righteousness of something for him.The third question: the phrase of the interpreters said: What is meant is from his saying: they benefit them and describe them to them with what is obedience, which is (P-158) to be made from the families of the money of the money.Their disbelief, and the father of a Muslim mentioned that it is against that, and what is meant is that you are with the killing and the latter Then, when they come out of the family, the father of Muslim and the interpreters said: They came from the authority of his saying, the Almighty: They believe in some of the book, and this is the best of the book, Because this saying is returned to what was presented from the remembrance of the Prophet ﷺ and what was revealed to them, and what is meant is that if it is in the book that is with you the news of Muhammad, then he is a mour The book and you disbelieved with one, and both of the two sayings bear the utterance of the benefit, because the abuse of the captive is described as his vraveal I am gathered by those who are close to him, because he said: I believe in some book and disbelieve in some of what you have to do with it.To matters, its remembrance is presented after verses.The following question: Some of them said: Those who were brought out and those who were a single partner, and that is that the Quran and Al -Muddir were two brothers like the people and the ward Al -Nadir with Al -Khurajj and Quraysh with the Aws.So every group was fighting with his horses, and if they prevailed, they would be raised and brought out.You fight them, then you will redeem them, and they say: command us to We redeem them and forbade them to fight us, but we are ashamed to be humiliated by our love, and others said: You are not those who have come out, but they are the people of God.As for the saying of the Exalted: It is forbidden for you to leave them in his saying: It is Jahan: The first: that it is the guarantee of the story and the affairs as if it was said.The second: It is a seduction of the lame, I will restore it, confirming that it was separated between them with words, so he put it on this, as if it was a lifting of it, as if it was the one who said: Return their remembrance of the first to the first.As for his saying: You believe in some book and disbelieve in some of the scholars, the scholars have disagreed with it on and bodies: one of them: they are the one who is a disbeliever Abbas, may God be pleased with them, and Ibn Jarraj, and he did not give them the sake of redemption, but they defame them on the contradiction, as they came with some duty and left the bone, Enter in the defamation, and it is not said that that exaggeration is a disobedience, so he called it a disbelief with the fact that it was proven that the sinner does not disbelieve; Because we say that they may say that that launch is not obligatory with the fact that the wise man was indicative of his duty.And secondly: What is meant by the alert is that they are in their contact with the Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, with the denying of Muhammad ﷺ with the argument of the pilgrim.The way of the predecessor of them is to believe in one another and atone for one another and all in the charter are both.As for the saying of the Almighty: Then you are killing yourself, the origin of the shame is humiliating and time.It is said: God's shameful, if he stood up and his distant, and it was said: The origin of the sacrifice, then it was said: God's shame is as if it was said: He sore him, and he signed from him, The great defamation, and they differed in this treasury on its faces: one of them: the good said: the purpose is the reward and the young, and it is weak because it is not a sign of that the reward was in the reward.Their project, but if we carried the verse on those who were in the time of Muhammad ﷺ it was true of this face, because it is from the sentence of the horse that occurred in the people of the people.And the second: the exit of the children of Al-Nadir from their path, and the children of Quraysh and the captivity of their slaves, and this is true if we carry the verse on the present in (P-159).And the third of it: It is the first that what is meant by him is the great defamation and grievances that are not devoted to some of the faces without some of the faces without some and denial in the saying The defamation is located in the great end.As for his saying: On the day of resurrection, they are returned to the most severe torment, so it is a question, which is that the torment of forever who deny the laws must be more severe, and it is more severe than the torment of the Jews: They are returned to the most severe torture and the answer: What is meant is that it is more severe than the holy hoop In the world, the “most severe” was preserved, even if it is divorced, but what is meant is more severe than this side.As for the saying of the Exalted: What is God with the heavie of what you do, in his two questions: the first question: the son of a lot of a lot, a farmer, and a nakedness in the winter of the rhetoric, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one: Building on the first words, you believe in some book and disbelieve in one another, and the second face: the construction is that the last of the words and the choice In the sense to be closed to the speech on the absence if they are gathered.The second question: His Excellency said: What is God with the heavie of what do you do hard and a great mit.It is forbidden for him, with him, with the ability of the Qadirin, and the facts arrived, not referring to its investigators.
