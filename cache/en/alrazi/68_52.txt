The Quranic researcher said: And they said: They say that they are crazy, and he is on the opening of the Surah.And what is this and this Qurâ€™an that claim that it is a connotation of his madness except for the remembrance of the two worlds, for it is a reminder to them, and the evangelization of them, and the evidence for them, Their minds are from the evidence of the neutrality, and in it from the etiquette and the judgment, and the path of the sciences, there is no limit to it or the restriction, so how is he who calls it a madman, and the one who is a madman, and the opposite of it, It is an evidence of things on the same as the mind of the righteous and the mind.And God knows the correctness, and to Him the reference and the mold, and may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and his companions and peace.
