The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, as we sent a messenger from you, who recites our verses, bless you, and teach you the book and wisdom, and teach you what you did not know.God Almighty has inferred the validity of the religion of Muhammad - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - with his faces: some of it is synonymous, which is that this religion is a religion With his saying: And whoever desires the religion of Abraham, except for those who shed his soul [Al -Baqarah: 130] and some of it is a proof, and he said: He said: Abraham, Smile, Isaac, Jacob, and Tribes [Al -Baqarah: 136] Then he is his pneumators and the height of this follower of this extension of two likes.One of them: Say it: They said they are sodels or Christians guided [Al -Baqarah: 135].And the second: The reference to the denial of the copying in this law, and it is his saying: The fools will say from the people what they have before the one who was before them.[142] And God (P-129) is the Almighty in the answer to the suspicion and the truth, so he did that; Because the greatest suspicion of Jews in the denials of the prophecy of Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - the denials of copies, so the sins of God Almighty do not come in the answer to the answer The answer is by saying: And to fulfill my grace to you, then this speech became with the answer in it about the suspicion, which is alerted it to the greatness of God To obtain the glory and honor in the world, and to reduce humiliation and insult it is desirable in it, and when the two things were met, he has reached the end in this door.* * * As for his saying: As we send us, he has an questions: the first question: this is enough, either that it is attached Wahwah: The first: that he returned to his saying: And to fulfill my blessing on you, that is, and I will not be blessed with you in the world by sending the Messenger.The second: that Abraham - peace be upon him - said: Our Lord and send them a messenger of them who recite your verses and teach them the book and the ruling, and he will be blessed.Our offspring is a Muslim nation for you and show us your insults [Al -Baqarah: 128] So that he was upset said: Let my blessings be upon you with the two bodies, and I will give you the same, and I will give you the same As we sent a messenger in you, a messenger answered his call, on the authority of Ibn Jarir.The third: the saying of my father, the Muslim Al -Asifahi, which is that the estimation: and so we made you a nation and a simplicity as we sent a messenger in you, that is, as we sent you a messenger of you And you described it as such and such, so we made you a nation and a simple nation, but if we say: It is attached to what is after it, then the appreciation is: as we have sent you from you, and you will send you a messenger of you.Remember me, remember you, which is the choice of the deaf, and its report: You You were on a picture that you do not recite a book, nor do you know a messenger, and Muhammad ﷺ a man from you who is not a book of a book, then I will come to you with the arrogance The Prophet, in which the news is about their conditions, and in which the alerts are on the evidence of al -Tawheid and al -Da`dah, and in which the alerts are on the ethical ethical, and the forbidden of the ethical of the ritual The proof is on his sincerity, so he said: As I have this grace and made it a sign for you, so tell me the thank you, and I remember you, The Almighty said: He has been among the believers, as he sent a messenger from them By remembrance and thank you, if it was said: (As) is it permissible to be an answer?We said: Al -Farah was distinguished and made for (remember me) two answers.One of them: (as).The second: I remember you and face that, because he was obliged to remember them, so that God will remind them of his mercy, and when he preceded him, he said: Because it is before the words, if the words are found in the words of the words, then it is a chapter, and it will be attached to it.The second question: In the face of the likeness of the saying: We said: The sufficiency is related to its saying, and my grace was fulfilled, the meaning was that the grace in the matter of the rhythm; Because he is the Almighty, he does the righteous, and if we say: He is attached to his words, the Almighty: so let me remember that, that the grace is with the male of the neighbor.The third question: (what) is in his saying: As we sent a source as if it was said: as we ask you in you, and it is necessary to be all.As for his words, the Almighty: It is for you, what is meant by the Arabs, and so is his saying: From you and in sending it in them and from them, a great blessing upon them, and for what is for them, and for what is for them, and for the one who has the same The state of the Arab nose of the nose of the purpose of others, so God sent him to the Almighty from their mediators; To be close to acceptance.(P-1330) As for his words, he said: Our verses are attributed to you, so know that it is one of the greatest blessings; Because it is a miracle of remaining, and because it is recited, and the worship is performed, and because it is recited, then all the sciences will benefit from it, and because it is recited, then the brother will benefit from it.As if he gets from his recitation, all the curators of the world and the hereafter.* * * As for his saying: He shares you in his words: one of them: that he - peace and blessings be upon him - teach them if they are touched by him, they have become zakat;
