The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: and they have come to Hajj and Umrah for God, for if you are confined, then what is made from the guidance and do not threaten your heads until the sake of the guidance of the guidance: The first question: “Hajj” in the language is a refinement of the intention, but it is said: the pilgrimage to the sole of the thing if he intended it once after another, and the conflict is perpetuated to him, “and the argument is for him” Rather, it was said that it is a pilgrimage that the people are pilgrimage every year, but on the urban, it is a name for a verb that is devoted to it, and there are no bones, and there are no bodies.Until he comes to him and the frustration is the obligations that are left something that is forced with blood, and the bodies are not obligatory to leave them, and the lanes of us are five: With the house, and the pursuit between the luxury and the bitterness, and in the head of the head or its shortness of it, they say: I am correct that it is a human being who does not get the solution except with it, And the one who is known to the strangers in a saying, and the house of the night of the night of the night in the saying, and the threw of the obstacle of the obstacle, and the house in the son of the one who said.As for the pilgrimage, the pilgrimage is a Sunnah.As for the pillars of Umrah, it is four: the warning, the tawaaf, and the pursuit, and in the throat, they say, then the domain, then he emptied from the pursuit, if it was with it, then it is with it.Look, and the solution does not stop the sacrifice of guidance.* * * Our companions went to the fact that it is divorced, and the meaning: do the pilgrimage and Umrah on the mourning of the blame and the perfection.And the second saying: It is the saying of Abu Hanifa - may God be pleased with him: This matter is crushing, and the meaning is that whoever is allaw in it is for him to fulfill it, they said: and from (p -119) Something is obligatory, but after the entry in it, it is a duty, and this disagreement is that the age is a duty of our companions, and it is not obligatory.The Hajj of our companions from the faces: the first pilgrimage: His exalted say: and the pilgrimage and Umrah are completed to God and the face of the one who is inherent in it that the perpetrator may be intended to do so And it is necessary to want it if you are based on the verb, then protect it, and if the invalidation is proven, it is necessary to be what is meant by this memory is that, but the exaltation of it is the one who does not say that Abraham, his Lord, was fulfilled with words, so they gave them [Al -Baqarah: 124], that is, they did to the path of completion and the fullness, and the Almighty said: Then they come to fast to the night: The night, and the sake of the memorizer on this is the first of the saying of those who said: What is meant, and they are granted in fasting and then they fulfill it, because on this appreciation he needs to need The guarantee, and on the estimation that we mentioned, does not need it, and it has proven that it was said: and the pilgrimage is to be entitled He carried it to him, the maximum in the chapter is that it is also enticed to be that what is meant by it is that if you seek it in it, they will fulfill it, unless the lord is made to the first one, and the first is the first, and the first is the first, and the first is the first The first: that carrying the verse on the second direction requires that this matter be the conditions of the Which we support do not need this condition, so that was the first.The second: that the people of interpretation mentioned that this verse is the first verse that came down in the pilgrimage, so he carried it on the positive pilgrimage, the first of its pregnancy on the imam.The third: He read each other (and established the pilgrimage and Umrah for God), and this is, even if it was an anomalous and anomalous reader, the author of the one who has the news of the one, but it is good for the righteous.The lord: that the face that we support it is beneficial to the pilgrimage and the Umrah, and the level of their completion is beneficial after the hurricane in them, and the interpretation of the one who is not mentioned is the one who is not.The garment, so it was the most largest one, so it was the pregnancy of the words of God, the first.Fifth: The door is the chapter on worship, so the one was in it in it, and the saying is positive for Hajj and Umrah with a closest to the point, so it is obligatory to carry the word.Sixth: Give us the sake of the word on the top of the perfection, but we say: The memorizer indicates the duty of the perfection as a reward.The completion is preceded by the honesty, and the duty is not fulfilled except by it and it is an estimated for the cost, so it is obligatory, so it is necessary that the hurricane be obligatory in the pilgrimage and in the pilgrimage.Al -Sabaa: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: He who is my soul in his hand is that it is its readers in the book of God, meaning that the Umrah is for the veil of the pilgrimage in the matter It was like his saying: they established the prayer and came to zakat [Hajj: 41].If it was said: Ali and Ibn Masoud read and the people “and the Umrah of God“ by lift, and this indicates that they intended to leave the life in the ruling of the pilgrim.We said: This is a buffer from its faces: the first: that this is an abnormal reader, so the frequent readers do not oppose.The second: that it has a weakness in the Arabic, because it requires the kindness of the nominal sentence on the actual sentence.The third: that his saying: Umrah is for God that it means that the Umrah is the worship of God, and the inventory of its place is the worship of God, and it does not contradict its answers, except for the slope It is not permissible.The lord: that when it was his saying: Umrah for God is: Umrah: Umrah The worship of God, P-120) must be a life that is commanded to say to Him, the Almighty: And they are commanded only to worship God [Al-Bayain: 5] and the command of the rituals.The second pilgrimage is in the path of Umrah: that its saying is the Almighty: the day of the greatest pilgrimage [repentance: 3] indicates the ritual pilgrimage, the miniature of what is upon him, and what is the right to do so.In agreement, and if it is proven that Umrah is a pilgrimage, it must be a duty to say it to the highness: and the pilgrimage is completed, and his saying: And God is on the authority of the people.[97] The third pilgrimage: In the question, there are no hadiths from what the son of Al -Jawzi wanted in the one who agreed among the two correct ones, “Jabril, peace be upon him, asked the Messenger of God.She testifies that there is no god but God and praise the Messenger of God, and that the prayer will be evaluated, the zakat will pay, the fasting, and the pilgrimage, and the exhaustion.Al -Naman narrated Ibn Salim on the authority of Umar ibn Os, “On the authority of Abu Razin, he asked the Prophet - peace and blessings be upon him - and he said:“ My father is a great old man, and he does not, Al -Dhana, so he said - upon him the prayers and peace: He was Hajj on the authority of your father and mourned.- He said: “Hajj and Umrah are Ramadan, which does not harm you with any of them, you have started.” God is a jihad for women?The fourth pilgrimage: in the garment of Umrah, Al -Shafi’i said, may God be pleased with him: He who is obligatory, and the argument of the one who said Umrah is not a duty of faces: the first pilgrimage: “The Arab who asked the Messenger - upon him the prayers and peace be upon him - from the peace of God Zakat, the pilgrimage, and the fasting, so the Arab said: Is this other than this?If you believe." And upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The sons of Islam are based on five: a testimony that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, the prayer of prayer, the payment of zakat, the fast of the pod.” And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Fifth of you, bless your mother, and perform your house.He responded, and on the authority of Muhammad ibn al -Makdar on the authority of Jabir ibn Abdullah, “On the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he was asked about the Umrah and is obligatory, it is not?” Mu'tazidah Al -Dair on the authority of Abu Salih Al -Hanafi on the authority of Abu Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - that the Prophet ﷺ said: The answer is from its faces: one of them: that what you mentioned is a single news, so do not oppose the Qur’an.And secondly: Perhaps the Umrah was not a duty when the Messenger mentioned - upon him be prayers and peace - that hadiths, then he came down after it, and he said: Because this verse was descended in the year -old.And the third of it: that the story of the Arabs is a disgrace to the mention of the pilgrimage, and there is no detail of the pilgrimage, and we have shown us that the Umrah is a pilgrimage because it is the pilgrimage, so it is not the pilgrimage For the authority of Umrah, and the hadith of Muhammad ibn al -Makdar, so they said: The narration of Hajj ibn Arqat is weak.* * * (P-121) The third question: Know that the pilgrimage is on three sections: the individuals, the Qur’an, and the enjoyment, so the individuals are to perform Hajj and then after the void of it It is perpetuated before a month, then he performs Hajj in that Sunnah, and the Qur’an is to be forbidden with Hajj and Umrah with the most famous pilgrimage that he intends them with the heart of it, and it is not in the heart of it.The most famous pilgrimage, then before the circumambulation, he entered the pilgrimage to become a couch, and the enjoyment is that it is forbidden for the urbanization in the most famous pilgrimage, and it comes to the ears, then it comes to the pilgrimage, Rather, it was called because it enjoys the prohibitions of warning after the dissolution from Umrah before it is forbidden for Hajj.If you know this, then say: People differed in the best of these three, so Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him - the best of the individuals, then the mortality, then the Qur’an, then The enjoyment is better than the individuals, and with it, the money of God, may God be pleased with him, said, and Abu Hanifa said - may God be pleased with him: the Qur’an is better, then the individuals, then the one who has the good Isaac and Al -Murwazi from our companions, and Abu Yusuf and Muhammad said: The Qur’an is better, then the enjoyment, then the individuals, the argument of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him The first: the one who is responsible for the Almighty saying: and the pilgrimage and Umrah are completed to God and the one who has been subjected to it from three of the three aspect He calls for the one between the consequences and the consequences of it, and the Maghreb does not get it except when the individuals, but when the Qur’an is the one who is the one, and it is one, and it is one of you, and it is one of you It is forbidden to be valid.The second: His saying: And take the Hajj and Umrah to God, it is necessary for the individuals, with evidence that he is upset, he said: If you are in conformity, then what is pleased with the guidance, Also, he is the highest of creation at the performance of one ransom, and the comparison is obligatory.When exclusively.The third: This verse is indicated by the duty of the perfection, and the perpetrator does not come except with the individuals and indicates that it is a matter He is pilgrimage to him, because he is pilgrimage from his homeland, and if not the travel is intended in the pilgrimage, it would not have been pilgrimage to him from the lowest times, and it also indicates that they said that they said: A kneeling is obligatory, and it has proven that the travel is an exclusive and the Qur’an requires the decrease of travel, because in its causes the travels becomes a travel, so it is not a traveler, so it is not the same In individual.The second: that the pilgrimage has no meaning except for the honorable bouquet, and an honorable viewer, and the pilgrim is the Zayyar of God, and God is the Almighty, and there is no doubt that it was the same as the time.Its satellite at the servant is greater, and when the Qur’an turns the two visits, one is a single resurrection, but the truth is that the total of the types of obedience in the pilgrimage and in the Umrah, and in the Umrah, One of the Qur’an, so it was proven that the individuals were close to the completion, so the individuals were that if it was not obligatory for you to judge this verse, then no less than it is better.The second pilgrimage: In Bayan that the individuals are better: that the individuals require that it come with the pilgrimage once, and then with the urge after that, then the hearts are in the shadow.It is obligatory to be the best of his saying, peace be upon him: The third pilgrimage: that he - peace be upon him - was a single person, so the individuals should be more than me, but our saying: It was a single, so I knew that the companions of the companions, the companions of this.A Muslim narrated in his authenticity on the authority of Aisha - may God be pleased with her - that the Prophet ﷺ was unique with Hajj, and Jabir and Ibn Omar narrated that he was a single, and he said: Standing with (P -122) Jarah, the Messenger of God ﷺ, and its saliva was flowing on my shoulders, so I heard him saying, “Low to you with Hajj and Umrah” On the authority of him - the narration of Aisha - may God be pleased with her - and Jabir and Ibn Omar on the narration of Anas from Wahwah.One of her: in the case of the narrators, as for Aisha, because she was a world, and with her knowledge, she was the most severe people to stick to the Messenger of God ﷺ, and the most people who are affiliated with him, I present a companion to the Messenger ﷺ from Anas, and if it was young in that time before the science, and the son of Omar, then it was with his jurisprudence to his jurisprudence to the one who is a grace.Because his sister was the wife of the Prophet ﷺ.The second: that the prominent of the Qur’an is sure of the accompaniment.And the third: that the individuals require the multiplication of worship, and the Qur’an requires its decrease, so the incidence of the individuals to the Prophet - upon him prayer and peace be upon him - was the first, and if the Prophet It was a single, and the individuals should be more likely; Because he - peace and blessings be upon him - was choosing the best for himself, and because he said: “Take your suffering from me.” That is, learn from me.The fourth pilgrimage: that the individuals require the multiplicity of worship, and the Qur’an requires its decrease, so the first was first, because the intended is the creation of heaven, and it was the creation The abundance of worship was better.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa - may God be pleased with him - from his faces: the first pilgrimage: holding the saying of His Excellency: and the pilgrimage and Umrah are to God, and this is the reason Each one of them, or the person who is intended to have a gathering between them on the path of completion, if we had carried it on the first, he would not benefit the second.It is more extensive, so it is obligatory to carry the memorial to it, because the first carried the words of God to what is more extensive.The second argument: that the Qur’an is a collection between the people, so it is necessary to be more than one of the two women.The third pilgrimage: that in the Qur’an, it is hurry to the two people, and in the individuals, it is left accelerated to one of the two women, so the Qur’an should be more preferred to say: The answer to the first: I indicated that this verse is indicated by three aspects of the significance of what is more accurate on the individuals.Where you said: Carry the memorizer on what is more over first, and if it was like that, the survival was for our saying.The answer to the second and the third: that everything that the penalty does does the individual does, but the Qur’an was a trick in the overthrow of the obedience, so the matter will be ended in it As for being better, not, and in the sentence, the philosophy - may God be pleased with him - does not say that the exclusive pilgrimage without a life is more than the pilgrimage, for the sake of the argument.With the pilgrimage at its time, then the Umrah at its time, so the group of these two things is better than those who come to the argument.* * * The loyal question: In the interpretation of the perpetrator in his saying: and take the Hajj and Umrah to God, and in it it is face.One of them: It was narrated on the authority of Ali and Ibn Masoud that their completion is to be deprived of his family's role.And the second: Abu Muslim said: The meaning is that whoever intends to perform Hajj and Umrah for God, the perpetrator must be required, and he said: It is indicated by the validity of this state that this is the same The infidels ﷺ in the last year of Hajj and Umrah, for God Almighty has commanded his Messenger in this verse that he does not return (P-123) until this is fulfilled, and this is the case.It is a construct of jurisprudence, which is that the pilgrimage and Umrah are voluntarily.And the third: The deaf said: God Almighty imposed the Hajj and Umrah, then it is commanded His servants are to fulfill the arrogant etiquette, and Sheikh Imam Abu Hamid Al -Ghazali - may God have mercy on him - mentioned in the book of life what is related to this door, so he said: Al -Kharj to the eighth warrant: the first: in the money, then it is not possible to start with the repentance, the response Return, and he returns what he has from the donations, and the good money is accompanied by what is sufficient for him to go away from his forth and his forth from otherwise, but rather from the face of the face of the face The increase and the companionship of the poor, and it is true before its exit, and it is bought for itself a strong tuberculosis on the bearer or for it, and it is for it, so it is for it, so it is for it, so it is for it, and it will be Everything he is satisfied with.The second: In the companion, then he will seek a righteous righteous, with good, insisted on him, if he forgot his remembrance, and if he recites his help, and if he is his help, and if he is his help, and if he is his help, and if he is happy Its strength, and if his breasts are narrowed, his patience is, and the brother and predecessors are residing, and he will call them, and seek their prayers, for God Almighty has made them in their prayers He says: May God call your religion, your safety, and the ends of your work.The third: In the elderly of the house, then if they are elderly, the two rak'ahs prayed in the first, after the conqueror, say, O infidels [the disbelievers: 1], and in the second It is lost to God with salvation.Al -Rabaa: If he gets at the door of the house, he said: In the name of God, I trust in God, there is no power or power except with God, and the more calls are more than.Fifth: In the knee, then if the rest is installed, he said: In the name of God and God, and God is greater, I trust in God, there is no power or power except for God It was not, the Glory be to God, who was harnessed for us and what we had for him, and we are to our Lord, to be transferred.Sixth: In the descent, and the Sunnah is that the most of his path is at night, and it does not come down until the day is dominated, and if the ritual ritual rituals, he will be blessed.The sword: his intention is an enemy or a seventh in night or day, so let him read the verse of the Karsi, and God is witnessed, the salvation, and the one who said: And I sought the neighborhood that does not die.The eighth: What is the honor of the land on the way, so it is possible to grow up three.The ninth: that this travel is not disturbed by the effect of urgent purposes, such as merchants and others.The tenth: that the human being for his tongue from the spoiler, the immorality and the roots, then after the coming of this advanced, it comes to all the pilgrims on the authority of the ritual And the Sunnah, and it is its abuse in all these things.Umrah is a comprehensive word of this suffering, then if the servant comes with Hajj on this direction, it was followed by the religion of Abraham; Where he said: And when his Lord, his Lord was given up with words, then they gave them [Al -Baqarah: 124].The luxury face: In the interpretation of his Almighty saying: And take the Hajj and Umrah to God that what is meant is: Express each one of them with a travel, and this is the one who said: With the evidence, and this interpretation is narrated on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, and he may be narrated from Abu Hurairah, and the age of the Qur’an was left That is to fulfill the pilgrimage and Umrah, and that he will be promoted in the past, the Hajj, for God Almighty says: The pilgrimage is a well -known months [Al -Baqarah: 197] and he narrated that he said: Your Hajj and your age.* * * Fifth question: Nafaa, Ibn Amir and Ibn Katheer, Abu Omar and Abu Bakr on the authority of Asim “Al -Hajj” by opening the H in all the Qur’an, which is the language of Hijaz, Al-Kisa’i and Hafs, on the authority of Asim by breaking in the family of Amran, said (P-124) Al-Kisae: They are two linguists in one meaning, as a rib and a rib, and it was said: And the Almighty said: If you are in conformity, Ahmad ibn Yahya said: The origin of the confinement and the blockade: the love, and it is said to the one who does not reveal its secret: Because he loved himself from the wip, the confusion of the absence, and the king's stories; Because it is like the loved one between the veil, and in a poetic poetry: ؎ is a jinn, but the door of the statistics is a ritual and the straw is known to be called to some parts of the parts By confusing the thing with others.If you know this, then say: They agreed on that the exclusivity is allocated to the enemy's prevention if he prohibits him from his meant Three sayings.The first: He is the choice of Abu Ubaidah, Ibn Al -Sakit and Al -Zajajj and Ibn Qatibah, and the most people of the language are that he is specialized in the disease.The travel, and a fox said in the eloquence of the words: And the second saying: that the memorization of the blockade is the benefit of the love and the prevention, whether it was due to the enemy or by the cause And the third saying: It is specialized in the prevention that has the one who is from the enemy.The enemy is limited, and the most people of the language are returned this saying to the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him The rule of blockade is when the enemy is fixed, and is it proven by the path of the disease and the bridges of the obstacles?Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, said: Al -Shafi’i said: I do not prove.And the Hajj of Abu Hanifa Dahir on the people of the language of the language, and that because the people of the language are men: one of them: those who said: The blockade is specialized in the love of the one who is the same This verse is a clear text that the blockade of the disease benefits this judgment.The second: Those who said: The blockade is a name for the divorce of the love, whether it was caused by the disease or by the enemy, and on this saying, the Hajj of Abu Hanifa is the same God Almighty suspended the judgment on the name of the blockade, so the judgment must be steadfast at the arbitration of the blockade, whether it is obtained by the enemy or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The blockade is a name for the prevention that has the enemy, for this saying is false with the agreement of the people of the language, and by the ability to prove it, so we can measure the sickness, and the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one A phenomenon, a phenomenon, for this is the report of the saying of Abu Hanifa - may God be pleased with him - and it is a strong phenomenon What is meant by the siege in this verse is to prevent the enemy only, and the narratives mentioned about the people of the language are opposed to the narrations that are mentioned on the authority of Ibn Abbas, and no Or to give them the lowest in the definition of the language and in the knowledge of the interpretation of the Qur’an, then we then confirm this saying of the state.The first pilgrimage: that the blockade is action from the exclusivity, and the verb is a way that comes in the sense of preparedness, we are: Zayd is more, and I am gone, and it comes with the meaning of this He became a lunch, and the man was raised if he became a foolish camel, and he came in a sense and found him with a description of such a bond, as well as: To prepare, it is obligatory to either carry it on the process or on the presence and the meaning: that they have become counted or found the counters, then if the family The counted is the meaning of the enemy, not by the disease, so the meaning of the blockade is that they have become a variety of people, or they found that they are in the way We went.The second pilgrimage: that the exclusivity is a phrase of prevention, but it is said to a person: it is a variety of his action and a loved one from his intention, if he is able to do so He prevented him from what he forbids, and the ability is a phrase from the entity that has the reason for the accustomed to the mood and the peace of the members, and that is the fact that it is the right of the path The verb, so the judgment is evident from it that it is a variety; Because referring the judgment to the obstacles calls for the necessity of the requirement, but if it is varied by the enemy, then it is the ability to do the act, except that it is not possible.The defending of the enemy, so it was correct to say that it is a variety of The verb, so it was proven that the vengeance of the blockade is a right in the enemy, and it cannot be a right in the disease.The third pilgrimage: that the meaning of its saying: you are confined to any love, you are forbidden, and the love must have no impur Plural and obedience, because love and prohibition are act, and adding the verb to the disease is a mind, because the disease is a symptom that does not remain two times, so how can it be an act of and the one who will be verb, and it will be an act.The enemy is that it is impressive and obedient, a true description, and the carrying of the words on his right to his pregnancy on his metaphor.The hungry Hajj: The blockade is derived from the exclusivity and the memorization of the exclusivity, there is no notice in it with the disease, so the siege is preserved.The derived.The fifth pilgrimage: that he said after this verse: Whoever is from you is sick or has a harm from his head, then he will be satisfied with him Inside in it, this was a kindness to the thing about itself.If it was said: He summarized this disease by mentioning because he has a special judgment, and it is the shave of the head, so the estimation of the verse has become if you are forbidden, and you will be in the sickness of you With a disease, you disbelieved and disbelieved.We said: This is if it is good for this syntax, except that with that, the kindness of the thing is obligatory on itself, but if it is not the restriction of the one who is a good man Something on itself, so the carrier was carried out other than the sick.The sixth pilgrimage: He said in the last of the verse: If you are safe, then whoever enjoys the urbanization to the pilgrimage [Al -Baqarah: 196], and the security of the security is not used in the good In the disease: he was cured and pardoned and is not said.If it is said: We do not surrender that the utterance of security is only used in fear, for it is said: the security of the sick is from the destruction and the one in the last of the verse is not the same.We said: The security is noticed if it is absolutely not restricted, then it is only beneficial to the security of the enemy.And his saying: Those of the other verse is not prevented from the first of it.We said: Rather, it is obligatory to say it: if you believe [Al-Baqarah: 196] there is no way that the security is obtained as of what, then (P-126) must be from the one who will be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not want His remembrance, and whose remembrance is presented is the blockade, then the estimation became: if you are safe from that blockade, and when you have proven that the mother’s memorization is not called only to the right What is meant by this blockade is the prevention of the enemy, and it has proven by this evidence that the blockade is removed in the verse is the prevention of the enemy only, but the saying of the one who said: It is the one who said: With this indicative.And there is another indication: that the interpreters are all together On the basis of the descent of this verse that the infidels restricted the Prophet ﷺ with the limitations, and the people, and if they disagree that the revelation verse is in the reason for what is it?However, they agreed on that it is not permissible for that reason that is outside it, and if the blockade was a name, the disease would be prohibited, so that it would be the reason for the revelation of the verse, With consensus, it has proven by what we mentioned that the blockade in this verse is a phrase of preventing the enemy, and if you prove this, then it is said: It is not possible to prevent it from the one who is the one who is forbidden, The first: The word ““ a condition for the people of the language, and the ruling of the condition is the detention of conditions from its optimism, so it is necessary that it does not prove that the ruling does not The verse is upon him.The second face: that the warrant is a must -to -copy of the copy.Until his elimination and the sick must not be like a enemy, and because the sick person does not benefit from his solution and his return from his illness, but the restriction is from the one who is a murder He stayed, so if he returns, you will be saved from the fear of killing, then this is what I have in this question on what is appropriate for interpretation.* * * As for his saying: What is pleased with the guidance is in his minds: the first question: the lock, may God have mercy on him, said: In the verse, there is an existence, and the estimation is: As his saying: Whoever is from you is sick or on a travel of several days from the last days [Al -Baqarah: 148], that is, the breakfast is a matter of time, and there is another gossip, and that is because it is from it: The guidance is completely complete, in which there must be angry, then they have two impersonations: one of them: to be said: the place of "what" is raised, and the ability: it is obligatory for you.The second: Al -Farah said: If you set up in the sense: guided what is easy, it was right, and more than what came in the Qur’an from its similarity.The second issue: The third question: the guidance: the gathering of guidance, as it says: a date and a bitterness, Ahmad ibn Yahya said: The people of the Hijaz are afraid of the “guidance” A gift, a gift, a folded, and a folded, the poet said: I walked with the Lord of Makkah and the prayers and the embrace of the guidance and the meaning of the meaning of the “guidance”: what is guided by the God of God.To him, with the guidance of the guidance, the human being guides to otherwise, approaching him, then Ali and Ibn Abbas said, Al -Hassan and Qutdah: The guidance is the highest of it A sheep, so he has the most easy of these sexes.* * * (P-127) The Funny: If he is a gift of guidance, does he have a swiftness that does not move to him?The Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - has a saying: One of them: He has no way for him and the guidance will be in his immersion forever, and with him the father of Hanifah said: He was obligated to the guidance of the guidance, and what you have proven to him is instead.The second: that he has an instead of transmission to him, and he is the saying of Ahmad, so if we say the first saying: Is he for him to be analyzed immediately or resides on his warning?In it, they say: One of them is that he establishes his warning until he finds it, and he is the saying of Abi Hanifa and indicates that the verse appears.And the second: that it is immediately analyzed to the hardship, which is the most correct, then if we say the second saying, then there are many disagreements and its closeness is to say: the guidance of the guidance is that It leads, but we said that because it is close to the guidance.* * * The fifth question: the limit if he wants to be analyzed and slaughtered, and it is necessary to intend to be analyzed at the sacrifice, and it is not permissible before the sacrifice.* * * The prevailing question: they disappeared in the life, so the jurisprudence has multiplied.It is invalid because his saying is up to the Almighty: If you are the masculine of the pilgrimage and Umrah, then it was a follower of them.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Do not threw your heads until the guidance is informed of his place, so he has questions: The guidance is his place, but rather the solution does not get the sacrifice, so the estimation of the verse: until the guidance is attained by its place and it is sacrificed, then it is sacrificed.The second question: Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him: It is permissible to subjugate the blood of the blockade, not in the sanctuary, but rather where he is, and the father of Hanifa said: The forbidden, and the origin of the seat in the interpretation of this verse, so the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The place in this verse is a name for the adulterers of the one who is the same.Abu Hanifa: It is a name for a place.The argument of Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - from his faces.The first: that he - peace and blessings be upon him - is confined to the limitations and erupted with it, and the Hadaybiyyah is not from the sanctuary.Bloom Mecca, which is from the forbidden.Al -Waqidi said: The Hadaybiyyah is on the expense of the sanctuary on nine mothers from Mecca, the lock - may God have mercy on him - replied in “his interpretation” on this question, so he said: That guidance did not fall into the sanctuary.Prevent the Prophet ﷺ from informing the guidance of his place that was He wants it, so this is indicated that they were sacrificing that guidance in the past.The second pilgrimage: that the confined to the solution or in the forbidden, it is a matter of the sacrifice of the guidance, so it is obligatory to be able in the solution and the deprivation of the sacrifice of the guidance.The first place: that his saying: If you are confined to everyone who was confined, whether it was in the solution or in the deprivation, and the saying of what is from that of what is from that of what is from that: It is a lot of guidance, or with it (P-128), so they removed what was facilitated from the guidance, and on the two estimates, it was proven that this verse is a sign of the authority that is upon me.The confined to whether it was limited to the solution or in the sanctuary, and if this is proven, it must have the sacrifice in the solution and the deprivation, because the cost of the thing is the first to be the first of the path The one who is taught to it, and if it is like that, the confined should be able to be able to be able to do so.The third pilgrimage: that God is the pursuit of His limitations, which enabled the limitation of the solution with the slaughter to be able to detect the soul from the fear of the enemy, so that the enemy is in the case of Silence except in the sanctuary and what the sacrifice does not obtain, the solution is not obtained by the verse of the verse.This judgment, and because the connected to the sacrifice to the sanctuary, if it is, he has denied the fear, and how is he believed in this act from the fear of fear, and if it is not, then it is not the same Do?.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa - may God be pleased with him - from his faces: The first: that the place is broken by the actual eye of the place, such as the mosque and the Majel The guidance is its place indicates that it is not in the immediate language to the place of the solution, and it has a language of its place at once.His answer: The place is a phrase of time, and that it is a famous that the debtor is the time of its garment.The second: He endowed that the note is not the place, but God Almighty has removed this involvement by saying: Then its place to the ancient house [Hajj: 33] Al -Kaaba [Table: 95] There is no doubt that what is meant by it is forbidden, because the house is not to be shed in the blood.His answer: Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him: Everything that is required to be forbidden in his money from the body and a gift of guidance, so it is not permissible except in the forbidden for the people of the people of his family: One of them: Whoever shot guided, then he will swear in his way, his slaughter and the one between him and between the poor.The second: the bloodshed of the enemy, for it is the ruggedness of where it is confused, for the verses that you mentioned in the path of blood, so you did not say that this is the one.The third: They said: The guidance is called guidance because it is a neighbor of the guidance that the servant sends to his Lord, and the guidance is not a gift unless he sends it The Mahdi to the House of Mahdi to him, and this meaning is not imagined except by making the position of guidance is the forbidden.His answer: This holding the name, then he is the most preferred at the ability.The lord: that the pilgrim of the pilgrimage is all near, or unbelievers, which only corresponds to the sanctuary, so this is this.His answer: that this blood is obligatory to remove fear, and the demise of fear is only if he is able to do so where he is in conformity.This meaning is not used in the path of blood, so the difference appeared.The third question: This verse is indicative of that they do not want them to be solved and they will be stuck to their head The Messenger, after the validity of the charity.* * His Excellency said: Whoever is from you is sick or with him from his head, then a vagina is from fasting, charity, or forgetting The guidance, whoever does not find the fasting of three days in the Hajj and seven if you return to that complete ten, that is for those who are not the people of the mosque, and they are the one God is the most powerful punishment; In it, there are questions: the first question: Ibn Abbas said: This verse was revealed in Kaab Bin Ajara, “He said as a player: My head is many of the lice and the worshipers, and he is spreading on my face, so the prayer and peace be upon him: The hurts of your head will harm you?So God Almighty revealed this verse.The second question: Faddiya is raised because it is a beginner, its news is deled He has a ransom.The third question: Some of them said: This verse is specialized in the confined, and that is because before the guidance of the guidance, its place may be in his right, and it is true that it is a pleasure, or it is a pleasure Patients, God is permission to him in that, with the condition of the vigil of the ransom, and others said: Rather, the words are insulted for every forbidden to the right of the sickness, or to his body In his head, he needed the throat, so God has shown that he has that, and he has explained what he must have from the acres.If you know this, then we say: He praised him on the condition of the ransom, and he may also need to seek goodness in many diseases; So the judgment is in it, and as for those who have it, whoever is his head, then this is the cause With the causes of headache, and it may be with the fences of illnesses or pain, and in the sentence, this judgment is general in all the prohibitions of Hajj.* * * The loyal question: they disagreed that it provides the ransom and then clears, or delays the ransom of the licensing, and which is required by the shadow that it is required.Fudity from the license; Because the feet are made for licensing as the cause in the duty of the accent, it was presented to it, and also, it was clear to us that the estimation of the verse is: then it is true.Speech except for this limit, then it is obligatory to delay the ransom.(P-1330) * * As for his words, the Almighty: from fasting, charity, or humanity, it is what is meant that this ransom is one of these three matters, and in the verse of the questions: the first: The worship, the son of Al -Arabi said: The human being is your silver captain, every captain of them is a human being, then it was said to the worshiper: people of you; Because he saved himself from the sins of the sins and described it, such as the saving captive of the slag, this is the origin of the meaning of the humanity, then it was said to the sacrifice: your forgetfulness; Because it is among the honor of the worship that it is close to God.* * * The second question: they agreed in the human being that the least of it is a sheep; Because the human beings do not perform except with one of the three things: the camel, the cow, and the sheep, and when the least of which was the sheep, there is no generosity, the least duty in the human beings is the sheep, but the ritual is the one who is fasting, but the ritual is the fast, but the ritual is the one who is fasting, but the ritual is the fast.On their own and how they are, and what he gets his two people; In it, they say: One of them: that he was obtained from Kaab bin Ajra, which was narrated In his head, he said to him: Fluce, then slaughter a sheep, or deaf three days, or feed three more than six days.And the second saying: What is narrated from Ibn Abbas and Al -Hassan that they said: Fasting is for the enjoyment of ten days.Two beautiful ones in this position, their pregnancy must be done on the interpreter, while it came after that, and it is the one who is obligated to enjoy if he did not find the guidance, and the one who says the first.* * * The third question: the verse indicated the ruling of those who submit to something from the prohibitions اللَّهُ عَنْهُ وأبِي حَنِيفَةَ الواجِبُ عَلَيْهِ الدَّمُ, وقالَ مالِكٌ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: حُكْمُهُ حُكْمُ مَن فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ بِعُذْرٍ, والآيَةُ حُجَّةٌ عَلَيْهِ; Because his saying: Whoever is from you is sick or with him from his head, then a fool of fasting indicates that this is the ruling on this excuses, and the ritual The condition.And the Almighty said: If you believe, know that you can be able: if you are safe from the blockade.And his saying: Whoever enjoys the Umrah to the pilgrimage; There are issues in it: the first question: the meaning of enjoyment is the pleasure, it is said: it is enjoyed by the thing, that is, the pleasure of it, and the enjoyment: everything that comes with it, and it is from it They say: a doorstep; That is, long, and everyone who has affected his companions with the thing, so it is enjoyed by it, and it is enjoyed by the urge to the pilgrimage is that it is made by Makkah, and it is a good thing in With a halal king, the pilgrimage is established, and it is Hajj from that year, but it is called a enjoyment because it is being resigned with the forbidden prohibitions of what is from the time He is forbidden by Hajj, and enjoying this face is correct, and there is no view in it, and we are other types of enjoyment, and he is the one who warned him, and he is the one who warned him of the authority of him, and he is the one who warned him of his life.Two enjoyment that were on the covenant of the Messenger of God ﷺ, and I have forbidden them and punished them: the woman of the women, and the enjoyment of the pilgrimage.What is meant is from this useful to collect among the two warmers, then the pilgrimage is annoyed to Umrah and enjoyed it to the pilgrimage, and it is narrated that the Messenger of God is the one who is good copies.It was narrated on the authority of Abu Dhir that he said: The pilgrimage was not for me except for me, so the reason was that they were not seeing the life in the most famous pilgrimage, and they are the one who did it.The Messenger of God ﷺ is the heroic of that belief in them, in which we will transfer them in the most famous pilgrimage from Hajj to Umrah, and this is a reason that he does not share with them.The pilgrimage is for them.(P-131) The second question: His Excellency said: Whoever enjoys Umrah, that is: whoever enjoys the cause With the prohibitions of forbidden in the cause of his edema, and this is the meaning of enjoyment by ude to pilgrimage.* * * As for his words, he said: What is easy from the guidance; In it, the first question: our companions said: For the blood of the blood of five, one of them: one of them: to offer life to the pilgrimage.And the second: to be forbidden by Umrah in the most famous pilgrimage, for if he is forbidden before the most famous pilgrimage and he came with something of the flood, and if it is a one who is in the same way This year is not required by blood; Because he did not collect between the two women in the most famous pilgrimage, and if he is forbidden by Umrah before the most famous pilgrimage, and he came with its tanks in the most famous of the pilgrimage, in which he said: It is obligatory to enjoy it; Because he came from the pillars of Umrah before the most famous pilgrimage, as if he had rushed before him, and said in “Al -Qadim and Al -Amal”: He is obligated to do so, and he will be made.His renovation, and Abu Hanifa said, may God be pleased with him: If he comes with some rituals before the most famous pilgrimage, then he is enjoying if he does not come with more.The third condition: to perform Hajj in this The Sunnah, if a pilgrimage in another year is not obligated by blood; Because there is no jungle of pilgrimage and life in one year.The loyal condition: that it is not from the present of the mosque for the sake of the Almighty saying: That is for those whose people were not present in the mosque, the mosque, and the present of the mosque, who was His family is at least less than the distance of the palace, so if it is at the distance of the palace, then it is not from the present, and this distance is considered from the Mecca or from al -Haram.The fifth condition: that it is forbidden for the pilgrimage from the hollow of the Mecca after the emptiness of the Umrah, then if it returns to the meeqaat, then it is forbidden for the pilgrimage that the blood is required; Because the blood is obligatory to leave the forbidden from the meeqaat, and it is not found, this is the prevailing conditions in the obligation of the blood of enjoyment.* * * Snack, and eating from it, the argument of the Shafi’i from the faces: the first argument: that the enjoyment has a creation in it; The blood must be a blood.Bayan, the crops of the immortality in it from the three faces: The first: It was narrated that Uthaman was forbidden from the one who used to be the one, so he said to him, may God be pleased with them: And the west, and that indicates a shortage of it.The second: It is the highness of its name, and the enjoyment of the pleasure and the integrity, and the building of worship on the hardships, so it indicates that it is in the case flaw.The third: It is the evangelization of the cell on the way of detail: that in the enjoyment, the travel became for Umrah, and it was his right to be for the pilgrimage, so the pilgrimage is the best pilgrimage The delegation is the time of the replacement between them, and that is a Khalil, and it was also from its right to make the meeqaat for the pilgrimage, so it is greater, so when he made the meeqa for the age of the age, then it was for the age As the vinegar in this pilgrimage, it is necessary to make blood the blood of a garden, no blood.The second pilgrimage: that blood is not an inherent from your insignificance, the pilgrimage or the Umrah, as if it is not overwhelmed with them, and as in the right of the angel, and the gathering between the servants, there is no With the way that those who combined the prayer and fasting and the reward are not obligated by blood; So you have proven that this blood is not a blood.It is necessary to have a blood.The third pilgrimage: that God is the Almighty and the guidance of the enjoyment is not to be tight, and his universe is not temporary, indicative on that it is a blood (p-132); Because all of them are temporary.The fourth pilgrimage: that the fast has an income, and the blood of the humanity does not replace the fast, and if you know the validity of what we mentioned, then we say: God is the Almighty.His saying: And take the Hajj and Umrah to God, and we have spoken to us The pilgrimage of enjoyment is completely; For this, he said: “Whoever enjoys the urge to the pilgrimage, then what is facilitated by the guidance, and that is because your enjoyment is signed by a lack I have performed you, for this is a sense of good concept from the verse of the verse, and it is not decided except on the gold of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him.* * * The third question: the blood that is required by enjoyment: the blood of a shame from the light, or the second of the goat, and if you share six in the core, or a bid, or a bid, or a bid, or a bid.Its must be deprived of the pilgrimage; Because the fulfillment is in his saying: So what is pleased with the guidance indicates that he is the reason for the enjoyment, and it is desirable to slaughter the day of the day, so if the day of the sacrifice, then the sacrifice of the day.Because the enjoyment may be fulfilled, and when Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, is not permissible, and this is the origin of this that the bloods are the blood of Jabr al -Jabran.The blood of the sacrifice, so that the day of the sacrifice is allocated.As for the saying of the Exalted: Whoever does not find the fasting of three days, the meaning is that the one who enjoys if the guidance is found, then there is no words, and if he does not find it, then he has lost the one who has been.الهَدْيُ أفْضَلُ أمِ الصِّيامُ?The apparent is that the principle is the most preferred, but it is exalted in this way that it is in the fullness and the reward like the guidance, and it is like it: that is a fully ten; And in the verse: the first question: the verse is a text, if it does not find the guidance, and the jurisprudence was measured by it if the guidance found and did not find it, or if it was a money, or if it was expensive, or if it was expensive We also turn to fasting.The second question: His saying: The fasting of three days in Hajj, that is, he has three days when he was assumed by Hajj, and he was separated from him.It is that the one who is enjoying if he does not find the guidance, his fast is not valid after the warning of Umrah before the pilgrimage is forbidden, and Abu Hanifah, may God have mercy on him, said: The argument of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, from his faces: The first: that he fasted before his time; It is not permissible as someone who fasted Ramadan before him, and if he fasted the seventy days before the return, but rather said: He fasted before his time; Because God Almighty said: Fasting three days in the pilgrimage and wanted him to warn the pilgrimage; Because the quarrels of the Hajj do not reconcile a way for the fast, and the forbidden reconciles; So it is obligatory to carry it on it.The second: that what is before the warning of the pilgrimage is not a time for the guidance that is better, so it is not a time for the fast that is the same as his admiration, and the argument of the family, Al -Badel, if it is the same as the origin of its place; He will become in the judgment as if it is the original, so it is not permissible to get at a time, if he found the origin, it is not permissible.If you know this, then say: They agreed on that it is permissible after the hurricane in the pilgrimage to the day It is permissible for the day of the sacrifice, not the days of the sequence; For him, peace and blessings be upon him: “And do not fast in these days,” and the desirable to fast in the days of Hajj, where the day is a break.* * * The third question: They disappeared in the intended from the return in his saying: If you return, then the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said in “the new”: He is the return to the people, and he said: May God be pleased with him: What is meant from the release of emptiness (P-133) is the pilgrimage and the taking of the return, and it is separated from it that if the seventh days are fasted, the seventh of the seventh is the way The commandment is to his house, he does not reward him with the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, and rewards him when Abu Hanifah, may God have mercy on him; The argument of Al -Shafi’i Wooh: The first: His saying: If you return with its intention to the stomach, then God Almighty made the return to the stomach condition, and there is no condition, and there is no existence of the condition, And the return to the stomach does not get until the end to the stomach, so he accepted it, and the condition was not found; It is obligatory not to find the conditions, and he will make sure of what he said that if he died before the prayer, there was nothing.The second: What was narrated from Ibn Abbas said: When he came to the Mecca, the Prophet said ﷺ: “Make your affection with Hajj with Umrah, except for those who imitated the guidance, and we have the guidance, The women, and wearing the clothes, then commanded the east of the narration that we will be with Hajj, so when we emptied it, he said: The guidance must be guided, so if you did not find, then there is a fast in the three You returned to your sales." The third: God Almighty has fallen from the fast from the migrant in Ramadan.So the enjoyment of enjoyment is the most lighter than it.The following question: The son of Abi Abla read “Seven” with a compassion on the place of three days, as if it was said: the fasting of three days, as well A day that is desirable to despair [the country: 14].* * * As for his words, the Almighty: that is a complete ten, and those who cursed God have cursed them in it from two sides: one of them: that the one who is good is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is good.His remembrance is a clarification of the clear.The second: that his saying: a complete illusion and the existence of ten completely in its entity, and that is referred, and the scholars mentioned the types of al -Fawid in this words: His saying: And seven, if you return, there is no text in the collection, but it may be in a sense or as it is in its saying: Muthani, three and three times: الحَسَنَ وابْنَ سِيرِينَ أيْ جالِسْ هَذا أوْ هَذا, فاللَّهُ تَعالى ذَكَرَ قَوْلَهُ: عَشَرَةٌ كامِلَةٌ إزالَةً لِهَذا الوَهْمِ.The second type: that the accustomed is that the substitutes are weakened by the extension, as in the overall with the water, for God Almighty indicated that this is not like that, it is not like that Performing the pendant; To be the lost for the degraded guidance for the domain of the fast, the soul will be the same to what he obtained from the best reward for God, and the remembrance of the twenty is to the one who is the same, but it is the same His saying: (complete), as if he said: That is complete, it is permissible for him to want the three of the seven, or the seven of the three of the three, so there is no one in the three, so there is no Ten, then know that his saying: (complete) bears the bias of the Khamal from three times: one of them: that it is complete in al -Badil from the guidance of his standing.And the second: It is complete in the fact that the reward of its owner is complete, such as the reward of those who bring the guidance of those who are able to do it.And the third of it: It is complete in that the pilgrimage of the enjoyment if this fast comes to be complete, like Hajj, who did not come with this enjoyment.The third type: that God is exalted, if he says: I have to fast for you ten days, and it is not far from that there is a sign that requires the ears of this one of these days.If the public is specialized in a lot on the legs and the kinship, and if he said: Three days in Hajj and seven if you return, the rest of it is the rest of the The specialty, if he says after it: that is a full ten, then this is a meantion that this special is not found, so you will be a little.To discharge and copy.The loyal type: that the duties of the numbers are four: one, the twenty, the hundred, and the thousand In this sense of interpretation, it is something that needs to be destroyed, so (P-1334) became the ability to speak: I have been answered by this number to make it a number of the elderly And installation.The fifth type: that the confirmation is a way that is famous in the words of the Arabs, as his saying: But the hearts that are in the breasts are miraculously died [46] 38].And what is in it is that the words that express it with many expressions, and it is known for many lines, far from the goodness and the humanity of the words that express it The one, the expressions of the many expressions indicate that it is in itself, including many interests, and the brotherhood is not permissible for it, but it is not the same as it It is not known from him as a salvation that is not permissible for him, and if the confirmation is a disgrace to this wisdom, his remembrance was in this place that is a sign of this The number in this fast is one of the tasks that its stains are not permissible.The sixth types: in the Bayyan, this speech is that this speech is with the Arabs, and they did not be the people He said in the month: This Thus, he indicated three times, and he pointed out again and he grabbed his thumbs in the third, stimulating the first signal on thirty, and by the second on nine and twelve.The sequence: that this speech removes the dominant dignity from the correction of the line, and that is because seven and nine are similar in the line, then if he said: Fully, this spatial is removed.The eighth type: that its saying: the fasting of three days in the Hajj and the seven if you return, it is necessary for it to be what is meant by it is that the obligation will be after the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the duty after the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be the one who will be the duty after the one who will be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is due after the return, On the basis of these seven of these three advanced, until the rest of it is after the pilgrimage, such as the three of those It is intended for it to be the duty after the return seven except for those three advanced three, for this speech is an innervated for these two, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said: Fullly removed this forms, and indicated that the duty after the return is seven by the three of the three.The ninth types: that the word, even if it is a news, but the meaning is an order, and the estimation: these fasts are complete fasting; Because the pilgrimage is a complete pilgrimage to what he said: and take the pilgrimage and Umrah to God, and these fasts are a barrier to the devils that occurred in that Hajj, so the rituals of these are the fast, so the fasts are the fast, so the fast is the fast, so the rituals of these fasts, so the fasts are the fast.In full until it is a domestication of the existing emptiness in that pilgrimage, which must be complete complete, and what is meant by the fact that these fasts are complete, what is reminded of the fullness of us, so that we mentioned in Bayyan, as well Rather, it was amended from the memorization of the matter to the memorization of the news; Because the abuse of the thing if it is very sure, then the purpose is the entry of the cost of it in the existence, for this reason, it is permissible to make the news from the authority of the people from the authority Emphasize the matter of it, and the grace of the law.The tenth type: that it is their pursuit and the exalted, when it was done by fasting three days in the pilgrimage and seven after the return from the pilgrimage, so it is not in this destiny that it is the best Glory be to him, and when he said after him: That is a complete ten, indicating that this obedience is in the end of the kinship, and that is because the fast is added to God Almighty: “The fasting is for me” and the pilgrimage is also added to God Almighty with the words of the one who is the one who said: “Do the pilgrimage and Umrah for God, and the text is indicated by the purpose of the sake of the two people.And exalted, the mind is also indicative of that, but in the right of fasting, it is because it is a worship that does not listen There is no crime that is not given only to the path of the pleasure of God, and the Hajj is also a worship that does not listen It is with that very hard; Because it requires the parties of the people and the cotton, and it is necessary for the most pleasant pleasure, so there is no crime that is not given it only to the illness of his illness, then if this is the one who is the same, then this is the one.It falls into the time of the pilgrimage, so it will be a collection between two things that are very hard, and some of it is signed after the emptiness of the pilgrimage, and it is the transfer of the hard to the hardship, and it is not difficult, The reward and the high level; There is no crime, and God is obligatory to fast these ten days, and his grace witnessed that he is worshiping in the end of the fullness and the highest The position indicates the greatness of the situation, as if he said: ten and any tenth, fully tenth, so he appeared in this twenty -year -old The spuring benefits, and this bay was fell in this way in this verse and praise for God, the Lord of the two worlds.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: That is for those whose people are not present in the mosque, and he has anxes: the first question: his saying: that is a sign of what is.The male is the male of what is required of the gift from the guidance and its replacement, and the most remarkable of them is the remembrance of their enjoyment.For this reason, they disagreed, and the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: He is returned to the closeness, and it is the necessity of the guidance and his extension on the one who is enjoying, that is, it is not that it is not.The present mosque is the forbidden, but if it is one of the people of the sanctuary, it is not obligated by the guidance or his replacement, and that is because when the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him;
