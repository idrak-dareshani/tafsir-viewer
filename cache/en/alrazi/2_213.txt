The Quranic researcher, and his saying is the Almighty: After what the sons came to them, it is necessary that God be the coming of the book, after the coming of the evidence, so the sons of the signs, so the signs of this A majestic that is not referred to the fulfillment of the book, and this structures cannot be carried on anything but the mental indicators that God has stabbed, the Almighty is not the same The saying of the prophecy, except after its evidence; That is because the speakers say: Everything that is not valid to prove the prophecy is only after its evidence, so it is not possible to prove it with the nobility of the hearing It is necessary to prove it with mental evidence, as this is the evidence that is presented to God's orphans.أمّا قَوْلُهُ تَعالى: بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ فالمَعْنى أنَّ الدَّلائِلَ إمّا سَمْعِيَّةٌ وإمّا عَقْلِيَّةٌ, أمّا السَّمْعِيَّةُ فَقَدْ حَصَلَتْ بِإيتاءِ الكِتابِ, وأمّا العَقْلِيَّةُ فَقَدْ حَصَلَتْ With the evidence presented on the coming of the book, then that the evidence has been completed and there was no excuse in the enemies, and if the symptoms and the no In the interest of envy, prostitution, and disgrace on the request of this world, and the opposite of this verse is the saying of the Almighty: and those who have been separated from the book are not separated from the book.As for his words, the Almighty said: God guided those who believed in what they have disagreed with the truth with his permission, so know that he was up to the state of the people of the book, and that the people of the book are the same The disbelief and ignorance of the cause of prostitution and envy showed that the condition of this nation is unlike those of those; For God, he who was immune to the shame and guided them to the truth in the things in which the people of the book were disagreed, narrated that he is peace and blessings be upon him, he said: “We are the last one, And we are the first people to enter paradise on the day of resurrection, even if they gave the book before us and we gave it after them, so God guided us to what they have disagreed with it, then they are the right of it The one who guides us, and the people have a follower and tomorrow for the Jews, and after tomorrow to the Christians, “Ibn Zaid said: They disagreed with the kiss, and the Juda was separated to the house.Al -Mushrq, God guided us to the cord, and they differed in fasting, so God guided us to the month of Ramadan, and they differed in Abraham, so I said to the Jews: We said: He was a Muslim Hanaf, and they disagreed with Jesus, so they were exhausted, and the Christians were overlooked, and we said just.* * * And he remained in the verse: the first question: from the companions who hold this verse on the fact that faith is created for God Almighty, he said: Because the guidance is the knowledge, and the knowledge is the knowledge of the knowledge God guided a text that the gift was obtained by the verb of God Almighty, and that indicated that faith is created for God Come here.He knew that this face is weak because we have shown that the gift is not, and the deduction is not, and the one that indicates here is that the guidance cannot be from the faith: The guidance to faith is not faith, as the success of faith is not faith.The second: that he said at the end of the verse: with his permission, and this permission can not be done to his saying: God guided; It is not permissible to give permission to itself, so we must be from the addition of this permission to it, and the appreciation is: God guides those who believe in what they believe, so they will not be.With his permission, and if it is the gift, the guidance is a definition of the insult.* * * The second question: The companions took this verse that God Almighty may be the believer with gifts that he does not do in the right of the disbeliever, and the one who answered it: They were taken into account, so he made a special guidance for them (P-16) as his saying: a guidance for the righteous [Al-Baqarah: 2] Then he said: Hadi: And the second: that what is meant by it: the guidance to the reward and the way of paradise.And the third: He guided them to the right to kindness.* * * The third question: His saying: Why did they disagree about it, that is, to what they have disagreed in it as the Almighty saying: They will return to what they said [the argument: 3] The way, the style, and the way.If it was said: Why did he say: He guided them for what they have disappeared in it from the truth with his permission, and he did not say: He guided them to the truth when they disagreed, and the conflict came?The answer is from Wajin: The first: that when the care was the remembrance of the difference, they started with it, then he made it easy for those who guided him.The second: Al -Farah said: This is from the heart, that is: guided them when they disagreed about it.* * * The following question: His saying: His permission is in it.The second: He guided them with his command, that is, the guidance was caused by the matter as it is said: I cut off the knife; That is because the right was not distinguished from falsehood and the matter of the matter, so the gift was made by the reason for it.The third: Some of them said: It is necessary for it to be lost, and the stine: guided them, so they were used with his permission.As for his saying: And God guides whoever is brought to a straight path, so the companions of the companions are known to him, and the disgraced is answered from three of the faces: one of them: The costs are special.The second: What is meant by the way is the way to paradise.The third: The kindness is intended for it, so it is special for those who know that he is reconciled to him and he is the saying of Abu Bakr Al -Razi.
