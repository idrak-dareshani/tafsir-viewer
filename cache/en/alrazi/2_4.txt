The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you and the hereafter they are sure to know that his saying is: He believed in Muhammad ﷺ, whether before that was a believer in Moses and Jesus, peace be upon them, or what was believed in them, and the significance of the general memorization of what is in the way The significance of the special memorization of that some, because the year leads to specialization, and the private does not involve it, so when this surah is civil, and the honor of the peace be upon you With his saying: He was guided by those who are righteous who believe in the unseen, so he mentioned after that the people of the book who believed in the Messenger: the servant of the Messenger of God With his saying: Those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, because in this specialization with the remembrance of more, they will be more like what was in the saying God, His angels, His messengers, Jabril and Mical [Al -Baqarah: 98] Then the sake of Abdullah bin Salam and his proverbs specializes in this supervision, so you will be desired, so he is a liking The reason for the remembrance of this special after that year, and then we say: As for his saying: And those who believe in what has been revealed to you, and he has the best of the first people: And among the disgraceful that faith, if it is prepared with cunning, is what is meant by believing, then if we say: So and so he believes in such, so what is meant is that he is true, and he does not have a fast, and he will not be.With faith, here is the belief in agreement, but it must be with the knowledge; Because faith is the way out of the praise, and the believer with the doubt is not safe to be a liar, so it is to the defamation.* * * (The second question): What is meant by the removal of the revelation and the universe of the Qur’an is descended, descending, and descending from it - that Jabril, peace be upon him, heard in the heavenly So the Messenger was revealed to him, and this is said: The mission of the Emir came down from the palace, and the message does not come down, but the listener listens to the message from the same.And the saying of the Emir does not separate himself, but he hears and he listens to and performs and performs with the same memorial, and it is said: So and so the words are transmitted if he hears in a place in the place.If it was said: How to hear Jabriel, the words of God Almighty, and his words are not from the letters and voices with you?We said: It is possible for God to create a hearing of his words, then he appreciates him on a phrase that he expresses from that the valuable words, and it is permissible to be in the right The preserved is written in this special systems, so Jabril read it to him, and he kept him, and it is permissible for God to create the voices of this.A special, so Jabril will be grabbed by peace, and he creates a fierce science for him Because it is the performing phrase, meaning that is the valuable words.* * * (The third question): His saying: Those who believe in what has been revealed to you this faith and obligatory; Because he said in the last: And those are the ones who are successful.Knowledge of what was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ on the way of detail; Because the woman cannot do what God has to do with knowledge and work unless he knows him on the way of detail, because if he does not know that he does not know that he does not know However, this science is attributed to the path of sufficiency, for the knowledge of the knowledge (P-31) is the descending on Muhammad ﷺ on the authority of the one who is over.As for his saying: And what was revealed before you, what is meant by what was revealed to the prophets who were before Muhammad, and faith in it and the obligation of the sentence; Because God Almighty is what we have worshiped now with us until he is obligated to know him, but if we know something from his conquest, then there is a reason for us.* * * As for his saying: And by the last they are certain of it in the books: (The first question): The last is the row of the last house, and it was called for that, because it is a delay The world is a minimum because it is lower than the hereafter.(The second question): The jungle is the knowledge of the thing after the owner was complaining about it, so this is not the saying: I have been taught and the extent of the soul, So, because when knowledge is not, it is not intended, and that is said in the knowledge of the knowledge of matters, whether this science was a warning or the one who said: In this words, even if he has known that he wanted him with persecution, and he says: I was taught that God is one, and if he had taught him to acquire; Therefore, God does not describe the exalted that he is skeptical of things.(The third question): God Almighty praises them as they are mastered by the hereafter, and it is known that he does not praise the woman, that the one who will be lost, and the one who will be lost, and the one who is lost, Rather, the praise does not deserve unless the hereafter is found with the arouses and question in it, and the insertion of the believers is the paradise, and the infidels are the fire.It was narrated from him, peace be upon him, that he said: “O wonder, all the wonder of the complainant in God, and he sees his creation, and wondering who knows the first woman, then he denies the ritual Whoever denies the resurrection and the enemy while it is on every day and night dies and lives - the meaning of the day and the vigilance - and the wonder of those who believe in the paradise of the paradise and what is in it The deception, and the arrogant of the proud of the proud, and he knows that his first is an excused sperm, and the last is a dirty fabrication.
