The Quranic researcher (P-37) [Surah Al-Banna] and it is the eight civil verses ﷽ It was not the disbelievers of the people A cleansing press in which there is a valuable books and what was separated from those who have been the book except after what the evidence came to them ﷽ It was not those who disbelieved The dismantling of the sons to come to them is a messenger from God that recites a pure newspapers in which there are valuable books and what was separated from those who have come from the book, except for the book Know that in the verse: the first question: The one said in the book Al -Bassit: This verse is one of the most difficult things in the Qur’an, in terms of purpose May God have mercy on him, and he did not summarize how the forms are summarized in it and I say: What is the Messenger, then it is the highest that they did not remember that they are dismantled about what is known, as what is meant is the disbelief that they were on, so the righteousness became: They disbelieved the disbelief of their disbelief until the evidence that is the messenger comes to them, then the word even if the end of the end is that this is the same On the authority of their disbelief at the Messenger of the Messenger, then he said after that: and those who have been separated from the book were separated only after what came to them, and this is the same The coming of the Messenger, peace be upon him, then obtains between the first verse and the second verse is contradictory in the phenomenon, this is the end of the forms, while I think.The answer to it is from the faces: the first and the best of the face, which was summarized by the owner of the scout: that the infidels are the two parties; The people of the book and the slave of the second, they were saying before the resurrection of Muhammad ﷺ: We do not disassemble what we have from our religion, and we do not leave it until (P-38) The promises, which are written in the severity and the splendor.He is Muhammad, peace be upon him, and God told the exalted, what they were saying, then he said: And those who have been separated from the book, which means that they were preparing the words of the word The Messenger came to them, then what separated them from the truth and does not read them to the infidels except for the coming of the Messenger, and his counterpart in the words is that the immorality of the one who is the one who preaches it is said: In it from the ugly verbs until God blessed me, and when God blessed him, the wealthy gave him the increase in immorality, and he says and preaches it: It was not a municipality, and it is not a municipality.You clouded your head in immorality, except after the right to remind him of what he was saying tabs and commitment, and this answer is returned to one of the letters, which is that he said: Those who disbelieved disbelievers from their disbelief The evidence comes to them, “a story of a story about them, and his saying: What separated those who have been separated by the book is a news about the fact, and the meaning is that the one who was faded was.And the second: that the estimation of the verse was not the one who disbelieved in their disbelief, even if they came to the evidence.Explanation of a word until this is not a language in anything.Muhammad with the opposite, the virtue, and the meaning: the people who disbelieved were disbelieved from the remembrance of Muhammad with the veiled and the virtue until you come to the sons, that is the son of the sons, Until you come, the memorization is the memorial of the past and its last meaning, and it is like the words of the Almighty: what the two devices recite [the cows: 102], that is, what followed, and the meaning is that they were not.Its vengeance, then when Muhammad came to them, they separated in it, and every one said in it another saying, and his counterpart, his saying, was the Almighty: They were from before They disbelieved, and when they came to them, they disbelieved, and they disbelieved in it.Dafon from their disbelief to the time of the Messenger, and the word “until” it requires that the situation be after that, with the difference of what was before that, and the matter is that, and the matter is that They did not remain on the infidels, but they separated, for those who have become a believer, and for those who have become disbelieving, and when the state of those of these gathering remains after the coming of the Messenger, as was the same as the one who did not That is in the work with a significance of even.Permanent, his truth, then that reward remains after the messenger of the Messenger, but they remained doubts, who are confused in that religion and in the path of the religion.People are one nation, so God sent the prophets, missionaries and warnings [Al -Baqarah: 213], which is the meaning that the religion that they were upon him became as if it was the same The Judaism was assertive in his Judaism, as well as Al -Nasrani and the worshiper of Al -Wathn, so when Muhammad was sent upon him, peace and blessings be upon him: the rituals were forced and the thoughts were forced.And his gaze and his article, and his saying is up to the Almighty: two people who feel this because the disintegration of the thing about something is his separation from it, so that it is what we have made Al -Aqadi, and what was separated from the reward, then the matter was not the matter.The book is as a separation of Jews and the Christians, and they were disbelievers with their events in their religion.They disbelieved in it as their saying: “Azir, the son of God” and “Christ the Son of God” and their permission to the book of God and his religion.The second: the two partners who were not attributed to a book, so God mentioned the Heaven of the September of his saying: Those who disbelieved on the scourge, then the exalt His saying: One of the people of the book and the participants, and we are two questions: (P-39) The first question: the estimation of the verse: the one who disbelieved from the people of the book and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The book of the book of them is a disbeliever and among them is not a disbeliever, and this is a right, and that the participants of them are disbelievers and who are not disbelievers, and it is known that this is not right.The answer is from his faces: one of them: the word “from“ here is not to be overflowing, but rather to the two people as saying it: so they will avoid the abomination from the second [Al -Hajj: 30].And the second: that those who disbelieve in praise be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, some of them are among the people of the book and some of them are among the participants, so the absence of a word from this cause.And the third of it: that it is his saying: and the participants are also a description of the people of the book, and that is because the Christians are like and the Jews are similar, and this is all, and this is all.The minds came to me, and he wants a people with them.And the Almighty said: The one who is the one who is prostrated by the well -known and forbidden from the denial and the preservatives of the limits of God [Al -Tawibah: 112], and this is a description of the sects of this Many, which is that people are brought up with various signs, some of which are overlooked by some of the waves of kindness, and it will be a description of one and one.The second question: Magus, do they enter the people of the book?We said: Some scholars mentioned that they were inside the people of the book because of his saying, peace be upon him: Among the infidels who were in the country of the Arabs, and they are the Jews and the Christians, he said a story about them: to say that the book was revealed to two sects before us [156] And the Christians.The third question: What is the benefit in the presentation of the people of the book in the infidels on the partners?Where he said: Did not those who disbelieved from the people of the book and the participants?The answer: The waw does not benefit the parasite, and with this in its in the wandering: one of it: that the surah is a civilian, as if the people of the book are the intended.And the second: that they were scholars in the books, so they were able to know the righteousness of Muhammad.And the third of it: that they are for them to be the scholars of others, so that they were unbelievers in the first place of the disbelief of others, so if they were presented in the remembrance.And its booster: that they are for them to be honored by them, so they were presented in the remembrance.The fourth question: Why did he say from the people of the book, and did not say from Jews and Christians?Answer: Because he said: From The people of the book indicate their universities, and that requires either a greater greater Increased in its infidelity, so they reminded this description, alerting it to that leadership of punishment.* * * The third question: This verse has rulings that are attached to the legs: one of them: that it is the highest, and it was pleased with his saying: those who disbelieve in the family, and the people of the people, It is required as one in the infidelity, and for that the scholars said: The infidels are all one billion, so the shared is inherited by Judaism and the opposite.The second: that kindness is obligatory, so we say: The dhimmi is not a polytheist, and peace be upon him said: The separation between the writers and the partner.The third: He alerted the remembrance of the people of the book that it is not permissible to seize the people of science, as he had spoken in the people of the Qur’an, such as what happened in the past nations.The following question: Al-Qafal said: The dissolution is the dissolution of the thing about the thing and its origin is from the jaw, which is the opening (P-40) and the ritual, and from it, then it is the book.So I opened it, and it is the fruit of the mortgagee, which is the demise of the fabrication that he had to do not see that he said: Something about something is that he removes it after the tampering with it, such as the greatness if it turns away from its detail, and the meaning is that they are clinging to the religion of them When the browning of the evidence, as for the evidence, it is the phenomenon that is distinguished by the right from false The evidence in this verse is sayings: The first: that it is the Messenger, then they mentioned that the Messenger was named after the sons, the first: the first: that the same was based That is because peace be upon him was in the end of the grandfather in the report of the prophecy and the message, and whoever is a liar who is manufactured, then he does not come from that Be honest or upset.The second is the information of the heroes, because it was in the end of the mind, and he did not remain except that it was true.The second: that the whole group in which it was in it was a single as a full miracle, and the note decided this meaning, and the hezali, may God be pleased with him in the book of the sake The two signs are called himself as evidence.The third: that his miracles of prayer and peace be upon him were in the end of the appearance and it was also in the absence of many, so that these two things were made as if he had made it like that Senior and argument, and that is the name of God Almighty: a bright sage [parties: 46].And those who say that what is meant is from the evidence He is the Messenger, with his saying after this verse: a messenger from God, so he raised the exile from the structure, and the servant of God has read: His saying: The evidence of the Evidence, that is, the one who preceded its remembrance in the mortality and the evangelization of the tongue of Moses and Jesus, or it is said: It is for the fool, that is, it is “the sons” The evidence is all the evidence, because the definition may be for the fools, as well as the denial, and God has gathered them.Then he praised the fabrication, and he said: A Messenger of God, that is, is a messenger and any messenger, and his counterpart is what God has mentioned in the praise of his soul, and he said: Then he said: It is effective, so he denied the aftermath.The second saying: that what is meant by the evidence is the absolute of the messengers, which is the saying of my father, a Muslim, who said: What is meant is from his saying: until the evidence comes to them, that is, to come to them, from whom you come to the one who comes to them.God is recited by them, and he is like his saying: The people of the book ask you to be revealed to them as a book from the sky [Al -Nasiyah: 153] It is an excuse to bring a published newspapers [Al -Muddar: 52].The third saying: It is the saying of Qutdah and Ibn Zaid: (The evidence) is the Qur’an and its counterpart is his saying: The first thing is that the evidence of what is in the first newspapers: After that: a messenger from God in which there must be an addition of deleted and estimated: that structure is a neighborhood: a messenger from God recites a purposeful press.As for the saying of the Exalted: He recites a cleansing newspapers in which there are valid books, so I know that the newspapers are a group of newspapers, and it is a kind of man, and in: (Purification) on the authority of falsehood, and it is like his saying: The falsehood does not come from between his hands or from his successor [separated: 42] and his saying: Marifa is purified [14].And the second: (purified) from the domestic remembrance, for the Qur’an is mentioned by the best remembrance, and the best of praise be upon him.And the third of it: to be said: (purified), that is, it is not possible to touch it except the purification, such as the words of the Almighty: in a book that they do not touch except the purification [78].(P-41) Know that the purification, and if it was running, is a mourning for the press in the phenomenon, then it is an obedience to what is in the newspapers, which is the Qur’an and its saying: it is written in it: The verses written in the newspapers.The second: The author of the system said: The books may be in the sense of judgment: God wrote to Ghulasabn [Al -Mujdalah: 21] and from the hadith of the Asif: With the ruling of God, it is necessary for the person to be said: “It is valid books, that is, valuable judgments The right to the right is shown Like the master and the dead, and it is like their saying: The evidence rose to such if he appears and was standing.The second: that the value will be in the sense of the standing, that is, it is an independent standing by the argument and the sign, from their saying: So, so that he would do it, and he will do it for him, and he will do it.The standing of the command of the people: the values, if it was said: how to attribute the recitation of the cleansed newspapers to the Messenger with the fact that it was illiterate?We said: If the legendary is recited in those newspapers, it was next to it and he came in a desperate book to Jaafar Al -Sadiq, that he was peace be upon him, and he was reading from the book.It was one of his miracles ﷺ.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: and those who have separated the book, except after what the evidence came, in it is the first: the first question: in this one, it is a question, and it is a question, and it is a question.The first surah is the people of the book and the participants, and we mentioned the people of the book only, so what is the reason for it?And his answer is from his faces: One of them: that the participants did not acknowledge their debt, so whoever believes is the intention and whoever does not believe in killing, with the disagreement of the people of the book of those who are the ones By making part of the part.And the second: that the people of the book were the scholars of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ because of the fact that they and their grandfather in their books, so if they were described as separation with the knowledge of the knowledge, then it was not for the knowledge of it Description.The second question: Al -Jubai said: This verse is invalidated by the saying of the estimated who said: People are separated in the righteousness and happiness in the origins The evidence, and the answer: that this is a pillar because what is meant by it is that God's knowledge of that and his will has it in the eternal, but its appearance is from the cost, but it is the case.The third question: They said: This verse indicates that disbelief and separation are their actions, not that it is estimated by them; Because he said: Except after what the evidence came to them, then he said: “The book, that is, that God and his angels brought them to that, so goodness and success are added to God, and the evil.The following question: The intended of this verse is the messenger of the Messenger ﷺ meaning: they do not separate you from their separation, so that is not for them in the Hajj, but rather to their curse So, they were not separated in the sacrifice and the worship of the calf: except after what the evidence came to them, it is a valuable habit for them.
