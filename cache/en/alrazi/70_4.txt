The researcher is the Almighty: The angels and the spirit are brought up to him on a day that was five years old, and we are a thousand years: The angels mentioned in the exposure of evolution and disagreement, the soul, after them, is mentioned, as in this verse, and as it is in its saying: the day of the righteousness of the soul: 38] This requires that the spirit is greater [from] the angels destiny, then it is a minute, which is that it is the highest mentioned by the elderly (P-109) the angels, first and the first, and the soul is the same And he mentioned the soul first and the angels secondly, as in its saying: the day the spirit and the angels establish a class, and this requires the universe of the soul in the first place in the first place in the first place in the first place in the first place in the first place The arrogance of the difficulty, and when this said some of the cosms: The spirit is a great light that is the closest of the lights to the majesty of God, and from it the souls of the sins of the good The homes of the signs, and among the two parties the dates of the monuments of the ownership and the paths of the homes of the Holy Lands, and he does not know its fullness except God The two speakers, which is that the soul is Jabril, peace be upon him, so we decided this question in the interpretation of his saying: The day the spirit and the angels will be righteous.The second question: The people who say that God is in a place, either in the throne or by it, in this verse from two sides: the first: that the verse indicates that the God is upon the authority of God.Knowledge, and it is like that if it was on the side of the authority.The second: His saying: The angels and the spirit are brought up to it, so he indicated that the elders of the angels and their reaction to it, and that is required as the one who is up to the authority of the The evidence is to abstain from it in the place and the party, it is necessary that it is necessary to be interpreted, and the description of God is that it is “the dioppers”, so it is mentioned to us.His saying: The angels and the spirit are brought up to it, so what is meant by him is not the place, but what is meant is to end the things to his intention as his saying: And to him, he will return The end to the position of splendor and dignity as his saying: I am going to my Lord [Safat: 99] and this is a sign that the house of the reward is higher and raised.The third question: the most of his saying: On a day of the link of a lameness, that is, the elderly will get in the same way as this day, and a fighter said: Rather, this is the one who said: Say and on this saying be in the verse, an evaluation and the last, and the appreciation: He asked a question with a torment and a fall, on a day that was five years old.And on the first estimation, that day is either that it is in the last or in the world, and it is possible that it is in the last, so that the length is either that it is that it is that it will be It is estimated that this is the faces that this verse carries, and we remember its separation.The first saying: that the meaning of the verse is that this is the elderly falls on the day of the last days; Fifth length is a thousand years, and it is the day of resurrection, and this is the saying of goodness.And the art of paradise and fire at that end, and this is not permissible, but what is meant is that their standing for the calculation until it is separated from the people, five years After that, the people of the fire settled in the fires of the fire, we seek refuge in God from them.He knows that this length is in the right of the infidel, but in the right of the believer, it is not, and the evidence is upon him the verse and the news, but the verse is the saying of the Almighty: Standardized and better, the one who is a ritual [Al -Faraqan: 24] and agreed on [that] that [the abode and the stable] is the paradise, and the news is what was narrated.God ﷺ: This day is long?He said: That is the stand, and if it is long, it is a reason for the more pleasure and the comfort of the people of Heaven, and it is a reason for the increase of sorrow and grief for the people of the fire.(The answer) It is that the hereafter is a house of reward, so it is not possible to hurry to those who reward them, and the house of reward is paradise, not standing, so then the one who is not the same With infidels.The second saying: that this period is located in the hereafter, but it is on the way of estimation, not on the way The minds of creation and their humiliation are for five years in it, and then it is a highness that completes that judiciary and government in the amount of half a day from the days They are brought up to the positions, even if one of the people of the world would be ascended to it to remain in that pharaoh in that one thousand years, and then they are in the way that they are in the time A saying, a gift and a group of interpreters.The third saying, which is the saying of my father, Muslim: This day is the day of the world, all of them are from the first of what God created to the last of the death, so he showed that there is no one in the day The angels and their descent, and this day is estimated at five thousand years, then this does not have to become known as the time of the resurrection; Because we do not know how much he went and how much.The loyal saying: the estimation of the verse: He asked a question with a torment and signed from God on a day that was five years of time, and then it is impossible for him to be a thousand years.The day is to be tightened on the infidels, and it is necessary for the intended to be able to do his duration, and on this, it is not intended The estimation of the torment of this fate, but what is meant to be alerted to the length of the period of torment, and it is also impeded that the torment that he asked for that liquid is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the question, Then it is a transcendence that takes it into another type of torment after that, because it was said that the son of my father narrated that Ibn Abbas was asked about this, and he said: His adherence is a thousand years [the prostration: 5] and he said: Makes called God Almighty, he knows how to be, how to be, and I will say that I say in it what I do not know, then what is said: Between these two verses?We said: He said, and he said in the answer to this: What is between the world to the top of the honor of the throne, the path of five years, and from the highest sky to the earth to the land; Because the show of every sky is a fifth year, and between the lower sky to the land of the earth, a fifth one, so he said: On the day of the day he wants from the day The fate of a thousand years, if they raised in it to the sky of the world, and the fate of a thousand years if they raised to the top of the throne.
