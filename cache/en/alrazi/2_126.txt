The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: And when Abraham said, Lord, make this a safe country and provide his family from the fruits of those who believe in God and the last day he said: He forced him to the torment of fire and the misery of the destiny, I know that this is the third type of the states of Abraham, peace be upon him, which God Almighty has said: And the last, because his saying: Lord, make this a safe country that can only be able to enter the country in the presence, and whom he mentioned after it while he said: The barriers are from the house [the cow: 127].The inhabitants of Mecca with security and expansion with what is to be made to Mecca because it is a country that is not planted and there is no gear in it, if not for security, then it is not overwhelmed with it, and it is not possible for it to be.God Almighty answered his supplication and made him safe from the pests, and there was no mighty to him except the divine of God as he did with the companions of the elephant, and we are the one: the first question: Al -Zubayr, and he raised the kaaba, and the intent of its people with all badness, and it was done for that?Answer: It was not intended to repel the heel for itself, but it was an exclusive thing.The second question: The one who is required of God is the Almighty is that the country makes a safe and a lot of shame, and this is what is related to the benefits of the world, so how can it be done.The answer to it is from his faces: one of them: that if the world is required to be strengthened by religion, then that was one of the great people of religion, then if the country is safe and he is in it His family of the obedience to God Almighty, and if the country was against that, they were against that.And the second: that he has made it a reward for people and people, but they can go to them if the methods are safe and the signs are soft.And the third: It is not far from being safe and the fertile from what calls the human being to go to that country, so that the great feelings are witnessed Security and the shame caused his connection to that obedience.(P-50) The second question: a secure country that takes two bodies: one of them: they are safe in it as an upper saying: in a satisfied life [Al-Qariya: 7].The second: that the intended people be the people of the country as its saying: and ask the village [Yusuf: 82], meaning its people, which is metaphor, because security and fear does not attach the country.* * * The third question: they disagreed with the security that is responsible in this verse on its faces: one of them: he asked him to security from the drought because he dreamed of his family.And the second: He asked him for the security and the generosity.And the third: He asked him the security of the killing, which is the saying of Abi Bakr al -Razi, and he took it He was upon him, peace be upon him, and he asked him for the first time The verse: Lord, make this a safe country and provide his family from the fruits and said in another verse: Lord, make this country a safe one [Ibrahim: 35] then he said in the last of the Lord: My offspring is a good, no one who has a transgressor [Ibrahim: 37] to his saying: and give them the fruits and know that this argument is weak.The security is from the eclipse and the generous, or perhaps the security is from the drought, then the security is from the drought, it may be by obtaining what it brings to it from the food, and it is in it.The first is the request of the removal of drought and the second question.The following question: They disagreed that the Mecca was safe and prohibited before the call of Abraham, peace be upon him, or if it was so that he said: Likewise, he never said to him, peace be upon him: “God has forbidden the Mecca on the day of the creation of the heavens and the earth.When your forbidden house [Abraham: 37] and this requires that she was forbidden before that, then his premature peace be upon him.Others said: It has become a safe sanctity with the claim of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and before him, she was the pads of the country and the evidence, upon him, peace be upon him: As he prohibited Ibrahim Makkah.And the third saying: It was a forbidden before the supplication in the face of the face, which it became forbidden after the invitation.The first is to prevent God from the Almighty from the darkness and what he made in the souls of glorification.The second is the matter of the messenger.The fifth question: He said in this surah: a safe country on the denial and said in Surah Ibrahim: This country is safe [Abraham: 35] on Al -Taraif: The first call was located, and the place was not made a country, as if he said: Make this valley a safe country because he is the Almighty, he said: He said: He said: He said: He said: Other than a group [Abraham: 37], he said: Here we make this valley a safe country, and the second claim was signed and it was made a country, so he said: He said: He said: He said: He said: A country with security and peace, as your saying: I made this man safe.The second: that the two calls are the place and then the place became a country, so it said: Make this a safe country that is able to appreciate it: make this country as a whole, as it is the country.A hot day, and this is reminding him of the exaggeration in his description of the free, because The denying is indicated by the exaggeration, and its saying: Lord, make this a safe country that means: make it from the full country in the security, and as for the saying of this: [Abraham: 35] There is nothing in it except for the request of security, not asking for the exaggeration, and as for his saying: He is given his family from the fruits, so the meaning is that he is peace be upon him.Their forces, so God (P-51) was attributed to him, so he made a maaka that the fruits of everything answered, but his saying: Whoever believes in them is from his saying: The believers are from his family in particular, and he is like his saying: God has the pilgrimage of the house whoever is able to be able to a path [Al -Amran: 97] and know that he is the best of them With his saying: The covenant of the unjust does not obtain a crime that is devoted to his supplication to the believers without the infidels, and the reason for this specialization is the text and the measure, but the text is not.On the unbelieving people [Al -Maaidah: 68] As for the measurement, he is one of them: The oppressors became a discipline in the question, so when God has distinguished the believers of the disbelievers in the chapter of the imam, there is no generosity of the believer in this God Almighty knows his saying: His enjoyment is a little difference between the prophecy and the provision of the world, because the corresponding to the prophecy and the imamate does not fulfill, because there is no one who does not fulfill, because there is no The imam and the prophecy is from the power of determination and patience on the back of the cultivation until God leads to God and forbids him and does not take it in the debt of the mother of the mother of the mother, The sustenance does not praise its delivery to the obedience, the infidel, the honest, and the hypocritical, so whoever believes, the paradise is his dwelling and its ideals, and whoever disbelieves, the fire is stable.The second face: It is impeded that Abraham, peace be upon him, is strong in his thinking that if he calls for all the many in the country of the infidels, then they will be in their dominance It is harmful to the people going to Hajj, so the believers summarized the claim to this reason.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty: Whoever disbelieves, he enjoys him a little, so he has two questions: the first question: Ibn Amir read, so he enjoined him with the absence.The rest of the Mim opening is tightened by the luggage, and the tension indicates the multiplication of the disagreement of diminishing.The second question: its enjoyment was said: with the livelihood, and it was said: by survival in the world, and it was said: they are to the Kharjah Muhammad ﷺ and he kills him or brings him out of him.The disbelief, and the meaning is that God is exalted as if he said: If you specialize in your believers, the believers, then I enjoy the infidel of them with the urgent of the world, and there is no one who does not do so The believers until his age is completed So he caught him and then forced him in the hereafter to the torment of the fire, so he made what the disbeliever was gave in the house With the lineage to them, they are very few, and it is obtained that God Almighty indicated that the blessing of the believer in the world is connected to the blessing in the last, with the success of the other It is interrupted with death and gets from it to the hereafter.* * * As for his saying: Then he forced him to the torment of the fire, so know that in the perseverance he said: One of them: to do what he is excused for him, and he is the one who is for him, and he said: Exalted: A day they call for the fire of hell with a call [Al -Tor: 13] and they are withdrawn in the fire on their face He gave him, and they said: His origin is from harm, and it is the bond of something from something, and it is the harm of women to her religion and her closeness.The second: that the persecutions are that the actor becomes eager to disagree and support until that the act is a choice, as the Almighty saying: So whoever is forced to do not: [173] So he described him that he is obliged to take over the dead, and if that is the most, then he will be the meaning: that God Almighty will resort to him until he chooses the fire, and he is the one who chooses the fire and the fire is that the fire is in the fire.If he had gone out of it, it would be forbidden from it, because whoever this is, he would make a refuge in the height in the fire, and then it is clear that this is the goodness Sleeping and pleasure, and the misery of destiny against it.
