The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: And fight them until it is not a temptation, and the religion is for God, for if they are over, then there is no aggression except on the oppressors in which the one said: This verse is a copy of its saying: Do not fight them when the mosque is forbidden until they fight you in it [Al -Baqarah: 191] and the correct one is that it is not like that The mosque, the forbidden, has denying its maximum, the maximum of what is in the chapter, that this row is general, but the Shafi’i is gone - may God be pleased with him - and it is true that the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the public.Or, delayed from him, he becomes a summary of it, and God knows.* * * In the Mecca until they went to the dug, then they kept on that harm until they went to the city and their imposition of the excitement of that temptation was that they left their religion, and they left their religion, So God Almighty has revealed this verse, and the meaning: they fought them until you appear on them, so do not give you every time for your religion, so do not fall into the evil.And the second: The father of a Muslim said: The meaning of the temptation is the generosity, he said: Because God Almighty commanded their fighting until they are not from them the fighting, which if they started, then they will be.They are afraid of it from the types of harms.If it was said: How is it said: and fight them until it is not a temptation with our knowledge that their fighting does not remove the infidels, and it is necessary that this is the news of God, not?We said: The answer is from two faces: The first: that this is the one who is the most difficult, because the most trivial when they are fighting the disappearance of disbelief and evil, because whoever has been killed, then he has been killed.From it the steadfastness on the infidels, then if this is the most difficult, it is permissible for that.The second answer: that what is meant by their murderer is intended from you to the disbelief of the infidels, because the duty of the fighting for the infidels is that it is his intent The infidelity, without the fighting, was obligated to him.As for the saying of the Exalted: The religion is for God, this indicates the burden of temptation on the evil, because it is not between the evil and between the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the religion The exalted be the worshiper who is obedient without a man who worshiped and obeyed otherwise, so the estimation became as if he was upset, he said: And they fought them until the disbelief will be removed and the disbelief will be removed, It leads to punishment (P-114) and obtains what leads to reward, and his counterpart is saying: They fight them or they are greeted [Al-Fath: 16], and in that, there is a matter The intended.As for the saying of the Exalted: If they are ended, then what is meant: if they are overlooked the matter that is for the sake of it, they must be rewarded, and it is either their disbelief or their fighting, then there is no They may fight them, and he is like his high saying: Say to those who disbelieve if they are finished, they will be forgiven for what the predecessor has been forgiven [Al -Anfal: 38].* * * As for his words, the Almighty: There is no aggression except on the oppressors, and he is in his face: The first: if they are ended, then there is no aggression, that is, then he will not be killed except for the one who is on the one They are their unjust in their disbelief, unjust to themselves with what he said: The evil is a great injustice [Luqman: 13].If it was said: This killing was not called an aggression with the same right and right?We said: Because that killing is the reward of the aggression, it is correct to release the name of the aggression against it, as it is the Almighty saying: and a bad way is a bad one: Take advantage of you, and they are used to him for the same as what you have taken over to you, and they were depleted and God has been depleted [Al -Imran: 54] so they will take mockery of them, God bless them from them [Tawbah: 79] They ended them from the polytheism and the fighting, you were unjust, so we will be obligated to you who is against you.
