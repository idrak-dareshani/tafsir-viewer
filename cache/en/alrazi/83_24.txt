which those close to.Know that he was glorified and exalted when they greatly in the verse of the verse that greatly gave this verse that you have, and he said: The righteous is in the nakedness of the righteous, and the righteousness is the same With three matters, the first of which is: his saying: On your opinions, they look at the locks: the families are familiar with the rhetoric, and do not be called as when they claimed, unless you are like that What is the rak'ah until we met a man from the people of Yemen, we told us that the rak'ah has that.As for his saying: (They look), it has three faces.One of them: They look at the types of their blessings in paradise from the eyes of the eye and the country, and the types of food, the drink, the clothes, the carrots, and others, said: He surrounds all of what God has given, and if we have been disturbed, he will be like the capacity of this world.The second: A fighter said: They look at their enemy when they are tormented in the fire.And the third: If they desire something, they look at it, then this thing will be attended by that, and know that this one is three in the section of the species of one, and it is the same The memorization is all, and it is taken in the Bags of a good interpretation: it is an honorable of all, which is that they look at their Lord and make sure of this interpretation of what he said: Their faces are the freshness of the ritual and the sequence of the freshness is the vision of God Almighty on what he said: The faces of the day are fresh to its Lord, the eyes of the resurrection: This interpretation confirms that it is obligatory to remember the male of the great pleasure, and it is only the vision of God Almighty?And the second: His Excellency said: It is known in their faces.Their faces of the readers indicating that, then in those readers say: One of them: that what is seen in their faces is from the laughter and the wickedness of what he said: A laughing traveler

a joke, in which there are two questions: the first question: in Bayan that the merciful is what is it?Al -Laith said: “The merciful” is the wine.And he sought to Hassan.Baradi is accompanied by the slaughter of the weapon.He spoils it, and perhaps it is the wine that God has described as the Almighty saying: There is no money in it [Al -Safat: 47].The second question: God mentioned the Almighty to this: (Al -Rahq).From the drink of a seal, it was chosen by his generosity with the chain of command of what the habit has been seen from the kings of what is honored and preserved, and there is another wine that is running from it.The pleasure of the two drinkers [Muhammad: 15] except that this seal is honored in the neighbor.The second: Abu Ubaidah, the mighty, and the dagge said: The seal who has the end of any punishment.And the third: It was narrated from the servant of God in Mukhtum that he is married.The wind of the musk was pleased with the married, because it was not mixed with the musk, when the winds of the musk obtained.Al -Rabaa: Mujahid said: A stretchy is a stretched, the one said: As if his intention is from the seal with the clay, it is that it is not touched by the hand until the abomination of the righteous, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the righteous, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the righteous, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is

one who is the one who sins.The first direction, which was mentioned by the lock.The second line: This merciful is his saying: His conclusion is a musk and in which it is a face: the first: the lock said: It is with it that the one who seals the head of the head of this Like the clay in which the heads of the boat are sealed, then that musk was a moisture in which the conclusion is printed, and this face is a picker for the first face of the one who told him about Explanation of his saying: Mukhtum.The second: What is meant by his saying: his conclusion is a musk, that is, the hold of the hold, that is, the last of it is sealed by the scent of the musk, and this face is a custodian for the one who is on the authority of the way Ubaydah in the interpretation of his saying: Mukhtum, as if he said, he said from a merciful, who has a punishment, then he was pleased with that punishment, and he said: That is the punishment of any He drinks it on the wind of the musk, and this is the saying of a relationship, the laughter, and Saeed bin Jabir, and the fighting and the murdered.The musk, the meaning of the (P-91) of the pool and the weaving of the wind, and its hugging, with the goodness And the reader of peace be upon him, and the choice of the Kasayi, is a reading: The meaning is that the conclusion is a name and the conclusion is a source as their saying: it is the

that the wine is marred by this warm, warm, which is concerned with the digestion and the strength of the desire, so that it is the goodness of the righteousness Their lust and the validity of their children, and this saying was narrated by Saeed ibn Jabir on the authority of Al -Aswad on Aisha, you say the woman, I have taken my time Taledi, Abu Al -Darwda said: It is a drink like silver, and they are sealed by the last of their drink, even if a man is one of the people of the world.There is no spirit remaining except for the goodness of his wind.The second line: His Excellency said: In

every one of the two people wants to be affected by it, and the meaning: and in that, let him desire the desire to be overwhelmed.He knew that the exaggeration of God is the Almighty in which it is indicated by the case of his affairs, and in which there is a sign until that competition must be in the same way as that, not in the same way The sneezing that is a secret of the annihilation.The righteous adjective: His exalted saying: His mood is from a tendon, and in which there are questions: the first question: a tendency of knowledge of the eyes of his eyes in the paradise, the name of the name The source of his sons if he raises it, either because it raised a drink in paradise, or because it brings them from above, on what was narrated that it is running in the air, and it is in the air, and it is in the air.Because it is for the sake of the many fullness and speed of it, it is up to everything that it passes through and it is its Sunnah, or because it is when it is seen, it is seen in it, and it is seen in it, and it is seen.Also, and that is because the origin of this word is for perhaps and the rush, and it is the one who sleeps the camel and I have been supported by the one if I am proud of him, and the saying of the immoral: Mahran that Ibn Abbas was asked about Tsanim, so he said this is what God says: Do not know the same as what is hidden from them from the village of the eyes of the one who said: It is that it is a matter that God has hidden from the people of Paradise.The second question: It is the highest mentioned that Sanim is a eyes that the

one who is the same This surah is that it mixes their drink from a eyes that the close people drink; We know that the two mockers are in this position, they are the companions of the right, and I say: This indicates that the rivers are varying in the garden, so the best of the righteous is the righteous.The best of the people of Heaven, and the Sunnah in the spiritual paradise is The knowledge of God and the delicacy of the view of God is the generous, and the Most Merciful is the approach to the knowledge of the world With the knowledge of the generous face, and the companions of the Yemeni, their drink is married, as it will be their view of it, and to its creatures.(P-92) And he passed.
