The researcher of the Qur’an, I am glorified and exalted: If my servants ask you about me, then I am a relative, I will answer the call of the bid.The first question: In the way of contacting this verse, what before it is a face: the first: that it is up to the one who said after the positive imposition of fasting and the rulings of the rulings of God: Perhaps you will be grateful [Al -Baqarah: 185], so the servant commanded the greatness that is the remembrance and the thank you, indicating that he was greeting him with his kindness, and the mercy of his soul His remembrance and thank you, so he hears his call, and he answers his supplication, and does not disappoint his hope.The second: He ordered the pride first and then wanted him to pray secondly, alert him that supplication must be (P -81) and that it is preceded by the good, not to be.When the supplication wanted the praise be upon him, then he said first: He who created me, so they guided [Al -Shuaraa: 78] to his saying: He who is uncomfortable to forgive me is the one who has forgiven me.[82] This is a praise of God Almighty, then he started after him in the supplication, and he said: Lord, grant me judgment and inject me with the righteous [poets: 83] So this is a matter In supplication second.The third: God Almighty when he imposed fasting, as he was imposed on those who were before them, and that was on the authority that if they slept, they will be forbidden to them Some of them until they disobeyed God in that mandate, then they were regretted and asked the Prophet ﷺ about their repentance, so God Almighty revealed this to God.Their repentance, and that tightening of them is due to their prayers and their burden.* * * After you call you?And he said: Oh Moses, I am the one who mentioned me.This is the description of God, His servants, in his remembrance, and in the return to him in all the conditions, so God Almighty has revealed this verse.And the second: “An Arab who came to the Prophet ﷺ He said: We are close to our Lord, and his successes, or distant, are calling him?And the third of it: “He - peace be upon him - was in a conquest and his companions raised their voices by proud and cheerful and supplication, so he said - peace be upon him:“ You do not call Hear close.And he paid it: What was narrated from Qutdah and others is that it was because the companions said: How do we call our Lord, O Prophet of God?Fifth: "Ata said and others: They asked him in Which hour do we call God?So God Almighty revealed this verse.So this verse was revealed.So God has revealed this verse.They regretted, and they asked the Prophet ﷺ that he is acceptable to accept our repentance?They asked the Prophet - peace be upon him - on the authority of God Almighty, then that question is either that he was a question about the same God Almighty, or about his attributes, or about his verbs, but the question is that Whoever passes the likeness, and he asks about the distress and the distance according to the self, and as for the question about the adjectives, it is that the questioner is asked about that he is a prayer The question signed as a listener, or the intended of the question is that it is the highest of the permission in the supplication, and is it permission in the supplication, and is it permissible to call it By calling it with a certain arrogance, and is we authorized to call it how is our thing, or what is the permission to call it on the face of a certain face, as he said: [Al -Israa: 110].Glory be to him: And if my servants ask you about me, all of these faces will be enticed, except that his pregnancy is on the question about the self.The question was about itself, not about his action.We know that the question was about kinship and distance according to the self, and also a saying that (P-82) says, but the question was on the verb, which is that he is the Almighty, and he is the one who answered, They are intended, with a sign that he said: I am close to him, he said: I answer the call of the bid.المَسْألَةُ الأُولى: اعْلَمْ أنَّهُ لَيْسَ المُرادُ مِن هَذا القُرْبَ بِالجِهَةِ والمَكانِ, بَلِ المُرادُ مِنهُ القُرْبُ بِالعِلْمِ والحِفْظِ, فَيُحْتاجُ هَهُنا إلى بَيانِ مَطْلُوبَيْنِ: المَطْلُوبُ The first: In Bayan, this near is not near the place, and it is indicated by his face Be in The small and the contempt is like the individual.If it was divided, it would be what was stagnant in its achievement to the achievement of each of its parties, and the part of the thing is otherwise Decreased to otherwise, and the lack of other places is possible for his own, modern and extremely incomplete to the Creator, and that is in the right of the Creator who is a referred, and he is a referral, so he is a referral, so he is a matter The place will not be close to the place.The second: If it was in the place, it was either that it was not dead from all the flaws, or it is not dead on one side without one side, or if it was died from all the sides; The first is referred to that the brightness of the seized was indicated that the custody of a distant distance is not referred.The second is also referred to this direction, and because if one of the two sides was deadly and the other is not deadly, it was the right of this one to the one who is not in the right The side that is not deadly, so it is obligatory from it as a richness of the different parts of the kindergarten, and the characteristic does not say that.As for the third division: that it is that it is depleted from all sides, then this is void by the agreement between us and between our own, so the saying is that it is the same.The third: It is that this verse is one of the strongest indications that the one is mentioned in this verse is not a nearby approach, and that is because it was the Almighty, if it was the one who was in the place, if it was the one who was in the place, if it was in the place, if it was in the place, if it was in the place, if it was in the place.Rather, he would be a relative of the burden of the throne, and far from other than them, and if he was close to the increase of the one who is the honor, he was far from the age of the age of the age It is a relative of all of us, knowing that the proximity in this verse is not close to the side of the side, and when it is prolonged that it is the same That the approach is what is meant in the sense that it is an adult that hears their supplication and sees their burden, or what is meant by this near: knowledge and memorization, and on this face, he said: 4] And he said: We are close to him from the rope of the person [Q: 16], and he said: What is from the Najwa three, except that he is the one of them [Al -Mujadila: 7] and the Muslims say that it is a place The mobilization, the keepers, and the prohibition if you know this present, then say: It is not far from being said that it was in some of those present, who was the one who was the one who was the one who was saying The Arabs of the Arabs and in the Jews and others who are his way, if they ask him - peace and blessings be upon him - so they said: Where is our Lord?It is true that the answer will be: I am a relative, and so if they asked him - peace and blessings be upon him - so they said: Do our Lord hear our prayers?It is correct to say in his answer: I am close, because the close of the speaker hears his words, and if they asked him, how do we call him by raising the voice or With his hide?It is true that he answers his saying: I am close, and if they ask him, do we give us our demand for the supplication?This answer is also reconciled, and if they asked him, if we are guilty, then we will be blessed, then may God accept our repentance?He reconciled that he answers his saying: I am a close, meaning: I am the one who looks at them, and the abuse of them and the acceptance of the repentance of them, so I have proven that this answer is that the answer is ( All the ability.* * * He disappointed his hope, otherwise that the intended is not for that time.He knew that his saying is up to the Almighty: I am a relative in which there is a secret of my mind; This is because the equivalent of what the possibilities of the possibilities of their existence were, but it was by finding the compulsions, so finding the creatures like the one who is intermediaries between what the places of the places, and the places To what is possible for all of the existence of that which is to it, but here we are higher than that, which is that the compulsion is the one who has for the sake of the sake of what the places of the municipality have become a mockery For his sake, the jewel was a phenomenon, the blackness is black, the mind is a mind, and the soul is a soul, so that it has its influence and its formation, the essences have become the same; So, by its influence and its formation, all that is what is that of what is the essence, so the measurement of what was previously was the precedents of the precedents.The formation of what is forbidden because it is not reasonable to make the blackness a black; So we say: Thus, it is also not possible to make the existence of goodness because it is what it is, and it is not possible to make the mystics indicate that it is for the sake of the time.The stabbing is what is also, so it is not the effective, and the mystical is what is in the way it is, too The appearance of heroes, then the ruling is that all of the acts are obligatory, and then the words that we decided.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty is: I answer the call of the bid, if he claims, and he has questions: the first question: Abu Omar read and said about the benefit of the “Al -Da’i” if he claims to me.And those who are deleted, for the first on the connection and the second is to reduce.The second question: Abu Solomon Al -Khattabi said: The supplication is a source of your saying: I called the thing to pray for a supplication, then they raised the source of the shrine of the name, You say I heard a voice, and the source may put the position of the name as their saying: a just man.And the right of supplication is the call of the servant, the Lord of His Majesty, and its assumption of it.And I say: People disagreed in the supplication, and some ignorance said: The supplication is something that is the most prominent, and they took it from its faces: one of them: That the one who is called by the supplication, if it was the information of the rituals with God, was the obligatory and the obligation of the brothel, then there is no need for supplication, and if it was not the knowledge of the rituals, then it was the one who is the one.Supplication.And the second: that the inauguration of the journeys in this world must be ended in the last to the effective influence that is due to its own It is not influenced, and all of that is referred, and if it is proven and the end of its end is the last to the effective influence, then all that is required of that influence is the valuable and the extent of the exaltation, and the existence of the validity, and it was the same.He was obligated to fall, and all that the influenced person did not require the validity of it, and the eternal old The bit is an effect, and they may express this words that they said: the foregoing and the judiciary is advanced, and the supplication is not increased in it and its left is not a decrease in it.- May God’s prayers and peace be upon him - “God has destined to create creation with such and such a year.” And it was narrated from him - peace and blessings be upon him - that he said: And the third of it: that the scholars of the seduction know the traitorous of the eyes and what the breasts are hidden [Ghafir: 19], so what is the need for my call to supplication?And for this reason they said that Gabriel, peace be upon him, reached the reason for this speech to the top (P-84) the degrees of salvation and servitude, and if only the supplication would be left.And the one who is upset: that the one who is required by the supplication, if it is from the interest of the servant, is the absolute horses that do not neglect it, and if it was not from its reconciliation, it is not permissible.Fifth: It was established with the talents of the mind and the authentic hadiths that the sake of the strands of the righteous and the highest is satisfied with the judgment of God Almighty, and supplication is contrary to that; Because it is a preoccupation with the mediation and a preaching of the soul of the soul on the intention of God Almighty and his request to share the human beings.And its sixth: that supplication is likened to the matter and the end, and that is from the servant in the right of the honorable, merciful, merciful.And his sake: It was narrated that he - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - said a narration from God, Glory be to Him and Him: So that this face was proven that the first was left the supplication.The greatest of the minds of the minds said: The supplication is the most important positions of the servants, and it is indicated by the faces of the transmission and the mind, but the evidence is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The question and the answer mentioned in his book in several positions from it, and from which it is terrified, and the fundamentalists say it: and they ask you about the spirit of the soul [85] The mountains [Taha: 105] They ask you about the hour [Al -Nazi’at: 42], and the pharaohs are from the cow on the following and ask you what they spend [Al -Baqarah: 219] they ask you about the month of Al -Shahr: They ask you about the wine and the easy [Al -Baqarah: 219], and they ask you about the orphans [Al -Baqarah: 220] and they ask you about menstruation [Al -Baqarah: 222], and he also said: They ask you about the Anfal: 1] The two centuries [the cave: 83], and you will tell you the most right is [Yunus: 53].If you know this, then we say: This is the question, its crops came to three types, so the prevailing in it is that he was upset when he told the question, he said to Muhammad: Say: In one form, the answer came with his saying: Say with the fulfillment of the punishment, and the reason for it is that his saying is exalted: and they ask you about the mountains [Taha: 105] This is a fundamentalist question, so there is no crime.There is an infidel and then the answer is estimated that the regret is possible in every part of the mountains of the mountain, so it is possible in all and the permissibility of its numbers, which indicates the abuse of it.فَهي فُرُوعِيَّةٌ فَلا جَرَمَ لَمْ يَذْكُرْ فِيها فاءَ التَّعْقِيبِ, أمّا الصُّورَةُ الثّالِثَةُ وهي في هَذِهِ الآيَةِ قالَ: وإذا سَألَكَ عِبادِي عَنِّي فَإنِّي قَرِيبٌ ولَمْ يَقُلْ فَقُلْ إنِّي قَرِيبٌ It is indicated by the greatest of the supplication from the faces: the first: as if he was groaning and exalted, he says that you are, but you are needed to the mediator, without the time of the supplication, in the place of the supplication And among you.The second: that his saying: And if my servants ask you about me, it will indicate that the servant is for him, and his saying: I am a relative that indicates that the Lord is for the servant.And the third of it: He did not say: The servant is close to me, but he said: I am a relative of it, and there is a secret in which a pleasure is a pleasure.It is possible for him to near the Lord.For this, he said: I am close.And the lord: that as long as his mind remains busy, without God, then he does not have a call for him, so if he knows about everyone, he will be used in the knowledge of the sake This denomination is noticed to its right and asking for its calamity, so when the rids benefit in the kidneys, then the proximity of the proximity is done, so as long as the servant remains to the servant, it is not the servant of the servant His soul was not close to God Almighty, because that is the abundance of God, and it has proven that the supplication is beneficial to the proximity of God, so the supplication is the best.(P-85) Hope: And your Lord said, "Let me respond to you [Ghafir: 60].The third pilgrimage: that it is not the same as the preference of the supplication on the matter of it, but rather indicated in another verse that if he did not ask, he will be angry, then he said: They were lost, but their hearts were measured and the Satan was decorated with them.He is rewarded and says: Oh God, forgive me.Your Lord, pray for me, I will respond to you, so he said: “The supplication is worship” “It means that it is the greatest of worship and the best of worship, as it is the saying of God.” That is, the kaqouf with a definition is the great knee.The Funny Hajj: His Excellency said: Call your Lord, and hidden and hidden [Al -A'raf: 55], and he said: Say: What I love with you, my Lord, without your prayers [Al -Furdan: 77] The supplication was overwhelmed by the Qur’an.The answer to the first suspicion: that it is contradictory, because the feet of the human being on the supplication, if it is the information of the juvenile Your denial is a need, then we say: How is the knowledge of God Almighty and how to judge his judiciary and his ability is absent from the minds, and the divine wisdom is that the servant is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The hope and between the fearful fear of the servants, and with this way, it was correct for the saying with the endowment with the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of God In all, and for this forms, “The companions asked the Messenger of God ﷺ and they said: I saw our work that this is more than something that has been emptied of it or a matter that he will be forgotten?And they said: So the work is a work, then he said: So look at the sects of this hadith, so he - peace be upon him - commented on them among the two things, and their elderly elaborated them.The phenomenon of the work is disturbed by the benefit of the judiciary and the destiny, and no one left the two things for the other, and it was told that the work of the work is the one who is unjust from it, so he said: خُلِقَ لَهُ" “, يُرِيدُ أنَّهُ مُيَسَّرٌ في أيّامِ حَياتِهِ لِلْعَمَلِ الَّذِي سَبَقَ لَهُ القَدَرُ قَبْلَ وُجُودِهِ, إلّا أنَّكَ تُحِبُّ أنْ تَعْلَمَ هَهُنا فَرْقَ ما بَيْنَ المُيَسَّرِ And the deceased, and he gave his knowledge, for it is the house of the judiciary and the destiny, and also the saying in the chapter of gain and the sustenance, for it is the one who is in the authority of it.It is decreased by the leaving.And the answer to the second suspicion: It is not intended from the supplication to the media, but The defamation of worshipers, humiliation, fractures, and return to God in the college.And on the third of the third: it is permissible to become a reconciliation of reconciliation with the precedent of the supplication.And on the authority of Al -Rabaa: that if it is intended from the supplication, it is the disturbance of humiliation and the domestication, then then it is satisfied with what God has destroyed and ruled, so this is the greatest The likeness is in this section.* * * The third question: In the verse there is a problematic question, which is that he said: “Let me respond to you The one who is obligated to call him [ants: 62] and then we see the preacher in the supplication and supplication, so it is not answered.The answer is that this verse, even if it is divorced, is that it has been restored, and it is a restricted verse, and it is the saying of the Almighty: Rather, you will call it, and it will be called.41] There is no doubt that the divorced woman is based on the restriction, and then a report (P-86) in which it is in it is woven: one of them: that the preacher must be found from the supplication He asked him for the sake of her call and that if he agrees with the judiciary, then if the judiciary does not help him, then he gives a knife in himself, and he will be in the chest, The present wilatel, and in every case, it is not unique, and it is a type of admiration.And the second: What was narrated in his interpretation of Abu Saeed Al -Khudayri said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: Mercy: Either he is accelerated in the world, or that he will be saved for him in the hereafter, or that he will be dismissed from badness with the amount of what they called.And this news is the fullness of the Bayan in the revelation of this question, because it is up to the exalted.The promise is sincere.And the third of it: that his saying: I call me, I will respond to you, it is necessary that the preacher be a disobedient with his Lord, otherwise he would not have a reason for him, but for something that is not good, not for him It was proven that the condition of the preacher was to be a disobedient with his Lord, and from the attributes of the Lord, they will not do it except for what he agreed with his judiciary, his knowledge, and his knowledge, and his knowledge, and the ruling of the Lord, then This is how it is impossible for him to say with his heart and his mind: O Lord, do the action, the Blan, not a referral, but it must be said: Do this verb, if it is the verb, if it is the verb, if it is the verb, if it is the verb, if it is the verb, if it is the verb, if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is the verb if it is And your judgment and your judgment, and when this becomes the supplication that the verse indicates the formation of the answers to it, bewildered by this bitter, and on this question, the question is that the question is the question لَفْظَ الدُّعاءِ والإجابَةِ يَحْتَمِلُ وُجُوهًا كَثِيرَةً: أحَدُها: أنْ يَكُونَ الدُّعاءُ عِبارَةً عَنِ التَّوْحِيدِ والثَّناءِ عَلى اللَّهِ كَقَوْلِ العَبْدِ: يا اللَّهُ الَّذِي لا إلَهَ إلّا أنْتَ, وهَذا إنَّما He called a supplication Because you have known God Almighty and then you united him and praised him, so this is called a supplication with this interpretation, and when this meaning was called a prayer, it is called an answer to the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance of the acceptance, And the same is a lot, and Ibn al -Anbari said: I answer here in the sense of hearing because between the hearing and between the answers, the type of mandate, for this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same So our saying, God heard of those who praise Him, that is, God answered, so we say it: I answer the call of the bid, that is, the hearing of that supplication, then if it is done.I responded to you [Ghafir: 60] on this direction.And the second: that the person who is intended to be repentant is the repentance of sins, and that is because the repentance calls God Almighty to the repentance, and the supplication of the supplication is this.The repentance, and on this face also, no forms.And the third of it: that what is meant by the supplication is worship, peace and blessings be upon him: “Supplication is worship”, and what is indicated by his saying is the Almighty: And your Lord said to you.Those who grow up from my worshipers will enter Hell, and they will enter [Ghafir: 60], so it appeared that the supplication is here the worship, and if this is proven, then this is the answer of God.Abbreviating from the one who guarantees what is against those who are in reward, as he said: It is answered by those who believe and do the righteousness and increase them from the grace of this.And its elevation: that the supplication is explained by the demand of the servant from his Lord, his wages, so the question is reminded if he is married to this interpretation, it is not the same.The advanced, so it was proven that the forms are virtuous.* * * The loyal question: The dismissed said: I answer the call of the bid if he claims a discretionary with the believers who believe and did not wear them, and they will not wear them.The human being is that God Almighty has answered his call, a row of praise and greatness, that you do not see that if we want to be exaggerated in the preaching of a person in the religion of religion, then we are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a person who is the one who is a human being, The positions in religion, and the evildoer is obligatory in religion, it is proven that this description is only proven to those whose faith does not inherit the immorality, but the evildoer is what he does That is not called the answer to the supplication.* * * (P-87) As for his words, he said: Let them respond to me, and they believe in me, in it in the books: the first question: He sang for you, you are also a response to my prayers with you that you need me from all the faces, so what is most of this generosity, and in which there is a thickness of it For the servant: He answered my prayers until I answer your supplication, because if he said that, he would be my prayers, and this is alerted to him that the answer of God is his servant, and he is good.And that it is not related to the obedience of the servant, and that the answer of the Lord in this chapter to the servant is presented to the servant’s concern for the obedience of the Lord, and this is indicated by the corruption The loyal question.* * * He said like the heels of the Ghannawi: ؎ Barefoot is called, whoever answers to the peer, so he did not respond to that, and the people of the meaning said: The answer is from the servant of God, and God will be given to God.He is not required, because the answer of everything is on the authority of what he suits.The third question: the answer of the servant to God if it is an answer to the heart and the tongue, so that is faith, and on this estimation, it will be his saying: Let them be for me Careful, and if the servant's answer to God is a phrase of obedience, faith was presented to obedience, and the right of the systems was to say: Let them be believed to me, and for me, and for me, and for me, for me, and for me, for me On the opposite of it?And his answer: that the admiration is a phrase of purity and Islam, and faith is a phrase for the adjective of the heart, and this indicates that the servant does not reach the light of faith and the power of faith And worship.As for his words, the Almighty: Perhaps they guided, and the owner of the “scout:“ read ”guides“ with the opening of the hook and broken it, and the meaning of the verse is that if they do not In order to reconcile their religion and their world, because the Rashid is the one who was like that, it is said: so -and -so is a goodness, he said: “If you forget them from them,“ Women: 6] and he said:
