The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: Zain for those who disbelieved the worldly life and harnessed those who believed and those who fear them on the day of the Day of Resurrection Know that it is up to the one who was mentioned before the state of those who change the grace of God after what he came, and they are the disbelievers who lied to the mourning and the wickedness of the With the remembrance of the reason for the sake of it, this is their way, and he said: Zain for those who disbelieved the worldly life and the crop of these words, the people of the people.The infidels and the partners in the hypothesis of the mortal from the adornment of the world on the remainder of the other.In the verse: The first question: Rather, he did not say: (I was decorated) to his faces: one of them is the saying of the mutant So the meaning is like his saying: Whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord [Al -Qarra: 275], and he took those who wronged the shouting [Hood: 67].And the second: It is the saying of Al -Zajaj that the inheritance of life is not true; Because it is not a time with a male, such as a woman and a man, a camel and a camel, but the meaning of life, livelihood, and survival, so that he said: He said: Zain for the one And stay.And the third is the saying of Ibn Al -Anbari: He did not say: I was decorated; Because he was separated between Zain and between the worldly life with his saying: for those who disbelieve, and if he is separated between the feminine act and between the name of the name, the name of the name, Because the factor is rich in the ritual pity.* * * The Muslims, like the servant of God ibn Mas'oud, Ammar, Tabab, and Salam Mawla Abu Hudhafa, and Amir ibn Fahira and Abi Ubayd Poverty, harm, and patience are on the types of calamities, with the disbelievers in the blessing and comfort.And the second novel: I descended in the heads of the Jews and their scholars from the children of Qurayyah and Al -Muddir and the sons of Qanaka, they were ridiculed from the poor of the Muslims, who are the ones who are immoral Their paths and their money.And the third novel: A fighter said: I descended in the hypocrites Abdullah ibn Abi and his companions, they were harnessing from the exemption of the Muslims and the poor of the people We are prevented from getting off in all of them.(P-6) * * * And the third question: they disagreed with this as an adulterer.The atonement for the uncertainty for the world, and the ears of the hereafter in their eyes, and they are delusional that there is no validity for what is said from the last matter of the last, so do not lock you.He said: As for those who are forced from It is an adornment of that, and it is invalid; Because the adornment of the thing is the expert on his good, if the decree is God Almighty, then it is true in that time, or if it is a liab It is necessary to be good, so it is his improved actor for him as a calamity, and that is required that the infidel is a calamity in his disbelief and his disobedience, and this is the one, and this is the one who is the one who said, A liar in that decorating that led to that until he is not documented by a vocal and no news, and this is also disbelief.This is the blame of the words of Abi Ali Al -Jubai in his “interpretation”.And I say: This is weak; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: Zain for those who disbelieved all the infidels, this requires that all the infidels be decorated, and the adornment is not It is a miracle of them, except that it is said: Each of them was decorating for the other, and then he becomes a round, so it was proven that the one who adorns the infidels is for the whole of the infidels, not the unbeliever He is a luminous, so he said: The adornment is the absence of heaven and humanity; That is because these are the mazes inside the infidels as well, and we have indicated that the decoration must be of others, so it was proven that this interpretation is weak, For something, it is the expert on his goodness, so this is a variety, but the decoration is the one who makes the thing to be described as a decoration, and it is the characteristics of the one who is in the authority Decorate, and on this estimation, his words fell, then if we greeted us that the decoration of the thing is the expert of his goodness, why is it not permissible to say: It is good, and it is intended that it is the highest of the pleasure of the pleasures, the pleasures, and the rest, and the people about that is not a lie, and the belief in it is not in it.The college door.The second one: Abu Muslim said: It is impeded in Zain for those who disbelieved that they adorn their souls, and the Arabs say to those who are far from them?They do not want to go with the meaning of it, and it is the meaning of its exalted saying in the many verse: that they are reluctant [Al -Mawdidah: 75], that they are dispersed [Ghaffir: 69] Exalted: O you who believe, do not give you your money, nor your children from the remembrance of God [the hypocrites: 9] So this added to them when they were like the causes, and when it was not the one who was On the verb, the human being in the truth is the one who decorated itself, and know that this is weak; That is because his saying: Zain requires that a decoration decorate it, and the enemy of the truth to the metaphor is not possible.The third one is: that this decoration is God Almighty, and it indicates the health of this interpretation and Jahan: one of them: the readers of those who read (decorated for those who disbelieve) On the construction of the reaction.The second: His Excellency said: We have made what is on the ground a decoration for it, so that they could be bored, which is the best work [Al -Kahf: 7].Then those who say this interpretation are mentioned by his faces: the first: it is forbidden to be the Almighty is the decree of what it appears in the world from the flower, the freshness, the good, the goodness, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good He is a loyalty to his worshipers, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: Zain for people the love of desires [Al -Amran: 14] to his saying: Say: I will tell you good When their Lord is gardens [Al -Amran: 15] and he also said: Money and sons are the adornment of the worldly life and the rest of the righteous.Agreement, and the meaning in all (P-7) is that God has made the majesty of the world a house of lords and a bunker, so he installed in the length of the mill It can be left, but by the way to love that the soul tends with it with the mother of it, it is possible to return it to it to fulfill that of the two of the people, and for the sake of the believer.Suffice it on the permissible and stop it from the forbidden.The second: that what is meant by adornment is that it is the highest of them in the world, and he did not prevent them from raising it on it, and the hardship is in its request, so this is the name of the name.And he knows that the sentence of this face that we have said about the dismissed one is one question, which is that the fact that this adornment is in the heart of the heart, not from the heart of the disbelief Otherwise, the event has not been imposed, and this is referred, then this decoration that occurs in the hearts of the infidels, is it like the side of the infidels and the disobedience to the side It is likely, if it is not likely to have a girl with the human being with the fact that this adornment is in his heart as it is not with its hearts in his heart, so this is what is forbidden Its heart, and the text indicates that he obtained this decoration, and if we say that this decoration in his heart is likely to be made, the side of the disbelief and the disobedience is likely The choice is still; Because the state of the level of recession, when he prevented the two rituals, if one of the two parties is a prestigious one, he was the first to make the rituals of the rituals, and if the ritual becomes a ritual, the one who is the one becomes a ritual Al -Qaqaa, the harm that the two people are not married, for this is the question of the question, and it is known that he does not drive the faces that he mentioned.The third direction: In the report of this state, the intention: that God is the Almighty who decorated from the worldly life, what was permissible without the prohibitions, and on this way, this is the same weak; That is because God Almighty has specialized in this unbelievers, and the permissibility of permits is not summarized by the disbelievers, so it is forbidden that it is intended to be the same.Pencilizers, and also, if the believer, if he enjoys the permits of the world, will be enjoyed with it with fear, and the man is from the last one, so it is the same, so it is the same The most disturbing, and more than the wage of the hereafter, but rather the world is like the liquefaction to it, and it is not the infidel, for it is that it is the same He thinks; It is not possible that it is like the intended money without it, and if this is the case of it, it is true that it is not intended from the verse that is permissible, and it is also that it is up to the verse: And they harnessed those who believed and that feel that they were harnessing from them in the blessing The decorations did not fall into the permissible, but it was located in the prohibitions.As for our companions, they carried the adornment on the fact that it was created in his heart, the will of things and destiny on those things, but created those actions and the righteousness, For the acts of worshipers, nothing but God is His Glory, and on this face, what is meant from the verse appears.As for his words, the Almighty: They are harnessed from those who believe, so we have narrated in the Kayfa of that mockery and faces from the narratives.It is not given to (Zain), and the exile is not excluded after the past; And that is because God told them (Zayn) and it is a past, then he told them with a verb that they perpetuate and said: And they are harnessed from those who believe and mean that they are the sacrifice.They say: These poor people are left for the sacrifice of the world and its female and its lusts (P-8) and they bear the hardships and the fatigue to seek the hereafter with the words It is invalid, and there is no doubt that if the saying was the same, this was a mockery, but if the saying was proven with the authenticity of the enemy, the sarcasm was the sarcasm; Because whoever exposes the opponent of the king in the cause of a vicious self in the breath of numbers, there is no one in creation, one of the ends of it, but he said some of the people: The world, and the appeal to the hereafter is the belief in all the ability; For if the one is prolonged by the hereafter, it is only the dead, and it is a scourge and a number of breaths, and if the saying is correct, the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one An orderly matter, so it was proven that that was void and that the ruler of them is upon them.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Those who fear them, by the Day of Resurrection, then he has questions: The first question: Why did he say: Who are those who believe, then he said: and those who fear?.Answer: To show it that the great happiness is only to the believer, and to be a convent for the believers of piety.The second question: What is meant by this Fate?Answer: It has faces: one of them: that the one who is intended is the fateful time in the place; Because the believers are on the top of the sky, and the infidels will be in a prison of the earth.And the second: It is possible that the person is intended to be in dignity and custody.If it is said: It is said: so that it is above that in the dignity, if each of them is in dignity, then one of them is more than one of the other in that dignity, and the disbelief is not for him.How is it said: the believer is above the dignity?Say: What is meant is that they were by their sales of the world and then in the hereafter, the matter is flipped, for God is a high She was having disbelievers.And the third of it: that the intended is that they are on the authority of the argument on the day of resurrection; That is because the suspicions of the infidels may have occurred in the hearts of the believers, then they were returning them from their hearts with the end of the Lord, and the exaltation of God Something of that, but the youth will go away, and do not affect the Satan, as the Almighty said: Those who have been chosen were among those who believed to laugh at the saying Believers [the woven: 29] the verse.And the one that is the one: that the mockery of those who believe in disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection, according to the sarcasm of the disbelievers of the believers in the world; Because the savage of the disbeliever in the believer is false, and it is with its heroic to be eliminated, and the sacrifice of the believer in the infidel in the hereafter is true, and with the right of it.The third question: Does the verse indicate the piece of corruption?For a saying that he says: He is the highest of those who feared with this forthcoming, for those who are not the essence of the piety, and it is not necessary that it is not necessary Fateh, and if this is not the right to the people of the fire.Answer: This is a concept, so it is not stronger in the significance of the generalities that indicated that it is specialized in the pears of forgiveness.(P-9) As for his words, the Almighty: God bless someone who will be affordable, and it is inevitable that what is meant is from what gives God who fear the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one In the world, the types of his servants are given from the believers and the infidels, so if we carry it on the livelihood of the last, they carry it with its face Without an account, i.E.A wide sustenance, with no death, nor healing, and it is like his saying: Those are entering paradise, they are grateful for it.[40] He entered under the account, limitation, and estimation, so it is dead, so what is not deadly was not the case outside the account.And the second: that the benefits that are connected to them in paradise are rewarded, and some of them preferred as he said: So he will fulfill their wages and increase them from its grace [Al -Nasa: 173], so the preference is from it without an account.And the third of it: that he is not afraid of its benefit at him, so he needs to calculate what he comes out of it; Because the one is held accountable to know to the destruction of what is given and what remains, so he does not go over in his gifts to what he is crawling with, and God does not need the account; Because he is a rich scientist, not an end to his estate.And he paired it: He wanted to provide the people of Paradise; And that is because the account is needed if it is if it is given something, the amount of duty is reduced by what it was, and the reward is not like that, then it is the same The one who deserves the judgment of the promise and the righteousness remains.Fifth: He wanted that the one who is given is not a ratio to him to what is in the tank; Because he who is given at every time is a deadly time, not a referral, and who is in the treasury of God, it is not dead, and the one who is not affected by him is not for him, so it is not the same Other than an account, which is indicated that there is no end to the abilities of God Almighty.And its sixth: without an account, that is, otherwise, it is said, it is said: so that it is a reckoning, if he has a right, and this indicates that he does not fulfill it With him an account, but everything he gave, he gave him the gratitude of preference and charity, not by the right.And the sake of it: without an account, that is, it increases the destiny of sufficiency, it is said: So, it is spent on the calculation if it does not increase the destiny of sufficiency, but if it is more than it, then it is said that it is: Account.And eighth: without an account, that is, it is given a lot; Because what the account entered is a little.And know that all the faces are all inevitable and the gifts of God, it has an extension, so it is permissible for all what is meant, and God knows.But if we carry the verse on what is given in the world, the items of its servants are among the believers and the infidels, then it is in its faces: one of them: it is the one who is in the opinion of the verse that the disbelief is that it was The Muslims of the Muslims; Because they were inferring with the crime of minimum happiness that they are on the right and deprived the poor of the Muslims from those happiness that they are on the authority of the falsehood.This submitted by his saying: God bless those who follow the same account that means that it is given in the world who is unless it is that it will be from that Empathy, improvement, or bad, and that is attached to the watership You are inferred by obtaining the enjoyment of the world for you and the number of its crops to the poor of the Muslims as you are right and they are invalid, but the infidel, but the infidel of the disbeliever An increase in the repetition, and the believer may have a increase in it The two lists and the two of the two, and this is the Almighty: If only people would be a single nation, he would have made us for those who disbelieve in the mercy of their wildness.[33] And the second: that the meaning: that God provides those who are in the world from a disbeliever and a believer with a reckoning that will be for one of it, (P-10), no demand, no follower, no question, no question, no question, no question The infidel says: If the believer was the right, why did he not expand him in the world?And that the believer does not say: If the infidel is invalid, then why will he be expanded in the world?Rather, the symptoms are fallen, and the matter is his command, and the judgment is ruling that does not ask what he does while they are asking [the Prophet: 23] and the third: He said: The man says that if he comes to him, he is not in his estimation: this was not in my account, so on this face, the meaning of the verse is that these infidels, even if they are from the disbelievers, and if they are from the disbelievers, and if they are from They believed in their poverty, for God Almighty may provide those who are offended where he does not consider, and perhaps he will do so with the believers, and he said: So we enriched them from the money of the villages of the Quraysh and the heads of the Jews, and what was shown on his Messenger ﷺ after his death on the hands of his companions, so that they would like to do so.And short.If it was said: The Almighty said in the adjective of the righteous and what he will reach them with a bid [the news: 36] is not that as the contradiction to what is in this verse.We said: As for those who carried his saying: without calculating the preference, and carrying his saying: giving an account on the one who deserves the basis of the one who said: On what is the saying of the disgraced, the question is dropped, and as for those who carry his saying: without an account on the path of the faces, he may say: If that is in the giving, if it is the giving, if it is.It is correct from this direction to describe his being a bid, and it is not expressed by what we mentioned in the sense of his saying: without an account.* * His Excellency said: People were one nation, so God sent the prophets, preaching and cautious He disagreed with it except those who have been given after what the sons came to them in order A straight path I know that it is up to what was clear in this advanced verse that the causes of these disbelievers on their disbelief are the love of this world The meaning is not concluded with this time, but it was in the critical of the critical; Because people were a single nation, based on the truth, then they disappeared and their destruction was only due to prostitution, envy, and conflict in the request of the world, so this is the word.In the verse: (P-11) The first question: Al -Qafal said: The nation is the people who are gathered on one thing, some of them are bound by one, and it is taken from the perpetrator.The second question: The verse indicated that people were one nation, but it was not indicated that they were a single nation in the truth or in the false Three sayings: The first saying: that they were on one religion, which is faith and truth, and this is the saying of the most investigators, and it is indicated by his faces: the first: the first: what is the one who mentioned it: His Excellency, after this verse, said: God sent the prophets to be missionaries, and those who were warned, and the book was revealed with them with the right to the right, so that the people are in the right, so they will be blessed, so they will be blessed.This indicates that the prophet, peace be upon them, was sent when the difference, and this is confirmed by the words of the Almighty: The people were only a nation, and it is one of the people.He also confirmed what was reported from Ibn Masoud that he read: People were one nation, so God sent the prophets to his saying: to give you the people.If you know this, then say: The fulfillment in his saying: So God sent the prophets, it is required that they will be sent after the difference, even if they were before, before that The mission of the messengers before this difference is first; Because when they were sent when some of them were attached and some of them are invalid, then they were sent when they were all invalid The lock mentioned it, may God have mercy on him.And the second: He was the Almighty that he was a single nation, and then we trained in it, so they disappeared according to the significance of evidence for it, and according to the words He disagreed with it except those who have come to them after what the evidence came to them in the way between them and the backs that what is meant by this disagreement is the difference that is the one who is the one who is the one With his saying: People were one nation, then he was judged on this difference that he was obtained by the reason The false doctrine was obtained by the prostitution, and this indicates that the agreement that had been obtained before the conclusion of this difference was, but it was in the truth, not in the falsehood, and it was not in the right A single nation in the right religion, not in false religion.And the third of it: that peace be upon him, when God sent a messenger to his children, for all were Muslims who were obedient to God, and he did not speak to them, and he did not speak to them, and he did not speak to them The Cain of Abel with the causes of envy and prostitution, and this meaning is fixed by the frequent transmission, and the verse is applied to it; Because people are Adam and his children from male and female, they were a single nation on the right, then They disagreed with the cause of prostitution and envy, as God narrated from my son Adam, as he approached nearby, so he was accepted from one of them, and he was not accepted from the other: [27] The killing and disbelief in God is only due to the reason and the envy, and this meaning is fixed by the frequent transmission, and the verse is applied to it.And the one who was seen: that when the earth was drowned with the floods, it remained only the people of the travel, and all of them were on the right and the right religion, then they disappeared after that Its confirmation was known to the seized signs and the frequent transportation, but they disappeared after that, and it was proven that the people were a single nation on the truth That is, and the girl did not prove anything with the evidence that they were kept on falsehood and infidelity, and if it was also, the lord must be carried on the authority of what is not.It did not prove anything of the evidence.Fifth: It is that the true religion is not a way to it except in the eyes, and the view has no meaning except for the presentation of the submission to connect (P-12) with it to the consequences, and those who are A look that has been agitated to other submission, and the light or sectarianism is necessary, and they are invalid, so the theories are required to be given the last of the last to the forests, and the rituals, and that the bosses, Its ends to the boredoms, so the formation of the subconscious must also be ended in the formation of its validity, with the harm of the mind, and if you are the theories of the consequences of the consequences of the ancestors of the ancestors to the actions I know its health with the harm of the mind, and to the hypertrophies that I know its authenticity with the harm of the mind, and the piece must be made that the mind is not the same Output, but if he is offered to him, there is a superfluous reason, then there is a mistake, then you have proven that what is the same is the right thing and what is offered is the mistake, and what is the same The investigator and according to the time also, this is the appearance, so it was proven that the first is to say: the people were one nation in the right religion, then they disappeared after that The prostitute and the envy, for this is a reasonable indication, and the Qur’an has been preserved.If it was said: What is meant is from his saying: They are still different except those who have mercy on your Lord, and that created them [Hood: 118].We said: The meaning is for them to have mercy on them.And its sixth: His saying is upon him, peace be upon him: It is left with his original innocence, as it was from falsehoods, and that it is presented to the false religion for the output causes, and it is the pursuit of the father of the two.The corrupt of prostitutes and envy.And the sake of it: that God Almighty when he said: Did you not have your Lord, they said to me [Al -Arif: 172] So this day they were a nation One of the right religion, and this saying is narrated from Abi Bin Kaab and a group of interpreters, except that those who speak in this are in this story, and there is no research in this story The victory of this saying after that is the six -year -olds that we mentioned to this face, so this is the sentence of speech in the report of this saying.As for the second face: that people were one nation in the false religion, this is the saying of a group of interpreters such as goodness, giving and Ibn Abbas, and they are taken.He said: God sent the prophets, foresmanship and warnings, and he is only worthy of that, and the news is what was narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him: Their Arabs and their curses, and they were given them except for the people of the book.And his answer: What indicated that this is only worthy of it; That is because the difference is not required.If the previous agreement was an agreement on the infidels, the mission would be at that time, and where the mission did not get there, there is our knowledge that this was not the same The falsehood, then those who say this saying that the people were agreed upon the disbelievers, and it was said from the death of Adam to the time of Noah, peace be upon him, they were disbelieving Question and said: Is it not in them who was a Muslim who is Abel, and I will be left?And they answered that the majority was the disbelief and the judgment of the majority, and it is not accustomed to the few in the many as it is not accustomed to the few barley in the many righteousness, and it may be said: The Muslims and the House of War, even if there are Muslims.The third saying: It is the choice of my father, Muslim and the judge: that people were a single nation in contact with the mind of the mind, and it is the advent of the existence of the rituals of the rituals With his servants, thanks to his blessing, and the gravity of the mental doves, (p-13) like a darkness, a lie, the ignorance, the messenger and its proverbs.The judge took on his health that he said that the prophets are not beneficial to the general and the darkening, and the letter of fulfillment is the benefit of the crime, so he said: So he will send the Prophet.The mission of all the prophets was delayed from the one of the people one nation, so the one is the one who is presented to the mission of all the parties, and there is no need, and there is no Its law is not beneficial from the prophets, so it is obligatory to be in a project that benefits from the mind, and that is what it has shown, and also, the knowledge is good.The Creator and the Charity to creation and justice, in which there is a blessing between all, and knowledge with the ugliness of falsehood, shadow, ignorance, and sponsorship, in which there is between all of them On that, then they disappeared after that for separate causes, then he asked himself and said: Isn't the first people Adam Peace be upon him and that he was a prophet, so how is the proof of the people who are expelled before the mission of the messengers?And he answered that he was begging that peace be upon him, with his children, who were gathered on holding the mentor of the mind first It is began that after that, its law became a murderous, for people returned to the consultation of the mental partner, and I know that this saying is only valid The mind and its ugliness, and the words have a famous in the origins.The righteous saying: that the verse indicated that people were one nation, and it is not in it that they were on faith or on the infidels, so it is eager to the delusions.The fifth saying: that what is meant by people is the people of the book from whom he believes in Moses, peace be upon him.That is because we have shown that this verse is attached to what was presented from his saying: O you who believe, enter all of the peace of the peace: The interpreters claimed that that verse was descended in the Jews, so the Almighty said: People were one nation, meaning that those who believed in the mosaic of a mother, a single nation, And one of the people, then they disagreed with the cause of prostitution and envy, so God sent the prophets, and they are those who came after the peace of the peace, and the book, and the peace of the book, and the rituals of them, David, and Al -Tawarah to Moses, and the Gospel to Jesus, and the differences to Muhammad, peace be upon him, so that those books are tightly ruled in those things that are in those things that are in those things that are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones Picks for the purpose of the verse and an agreement to what he accepted and after it, and there is no form in which there is only for the people to be given in its saying: the people were not.You know that the thousand and the blame are as it is for the darkening, so it is also for the covenant, so this is related to this verse.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: So God sent the prophets, missionaries, and warnings, so know that we mentioned that we must be from the guarantee, and the estimation: So they differed, and God sent the prophets.He knew that God Almighty described the prophets with three characteristics: the first adjective: their signs are good.The second line: as they are warned, and its counterpart is the Almighty saying: a missionary messenger and a warning [Al -Nasiyah: 165], but the evil was presented to the signs; Because the evil runs the process of keeping the health, and the warning runs the course of the disease’s removal, and there is no doubt that what is meant by the self is the first without the second, so there is no generosity.The third adjective: His saying: The book was with them with the right, so it was said: The book is removed before the command of the matter (P-14) and the end to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one To them be before the tubes and warning, so the remembrance of the tuberculosis is presented And the warning to download the books?The judge answered him and said: Because the promise and the bound are before the two legs, it is possible, while it is connected to the minds from the knowledge of God, and the lavishness of the darkness, Another, which is that the cost is that the view is carried out in the cushioning of the rhetoric, and in the difference between the miracle if he is afraid that if he did not look at the right, then he will not look He is due to punishment, and fear is strong and complete with tabbar and warning, so there is no crime, and the evil and the warning must be presented in the book of the book.Then the judge said: This verse appears indicates that there is no prophet except with it as a book that is descended in which the truth is the right of that book or the short, and it was not the same, That writer is miraculous, or it is not like that; Because the written of the book is with them, it does not require anything of that.As for his saying, the Almighty is: to judge among the people, then know that his saying: to judge a verb, then it is imperative that it be heded to something that is mentioned, and the remembrance of his remembrance, and the remembrance of his remembrance, Three, so bring it closer to this memorization: the book, then the prophets, then God, then there was no crime.It is upon him, or the book, then every one of these tiredness is specialized in a ritual face.The truth is not the book, and the Prophet is because he is the appearance, so it is not far from being said: his pregnancy on the book is first, the most mere thing in the chapter is said: the ruler is God Except that we say: This metaphor is good that you can carry to Jahin: The first: that it is a well -known metaphor, it is said: the ruling of the book is in this, and the book of God is spent Be guidance and healing, it is permissible to be a ruling, he said: This Qur’an guides to the one who is more and preaches to the believers [9] and the second: The Qur’an and most of it.As for his words, the Exalted: While they disagreed about it, I know that the distraction is in his saying: While they disagreed with it, it is obligatory to be a back, either to the book, or to the truth; Because all their remembrance may be presented, but his return to the right is first; Because the verse indicated that it was upset, but the book was revealed to be a ruling when they disagreed with it, so the writer is tight, and the different in which it is ruled, and it is a rule of it.Against the rulers of it.As for the saying of the Exalted: What is different in it is only those who have given it, the first distraction is due to the truth, the second to the book, and the appreciation: and what is assigned to the truth is only those who are.Then he said the most of the interpreters: What is meant by the people: the Jews and the Christians, and God is highly high that reminds them in the Qur’an With this memorization as his saying: The food of those who have given the book a solution for you [Al -Maida: 5] Say: O family of the book, come to a word between us and between us [64] What is intended to disagree with them is to be atoned for some of them, as is the saying of the Almighty: The Judd said: The Christians are not for the sake of the people, and he said that the Christians have nothing to And they recite the book [Al -Qarra: 113], and it is possible that their disagreement is to deprive them and their exchange, so he said it: What is in it is not in it except those who have been in it Those who gave the book with the fact that the intended of the book is not to be overlooked and that they raise the dispute in religion, and know that this indicates that the brother is not in the right The mission of the prophets and the removal of the books, and that is required that before their mission, the difference was in the truth, but the agreement was in the truth, and it was a sign of it, and it was indicated by the one who said that it was that it was.A single nation is one nation in the religion of the right.(P-15)
