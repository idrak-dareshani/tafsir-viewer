The Quranic researcher, as he said, is the Almighty: I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship, nor do I worship what you worshiped, nor do you worship what I worship (p-135), then the one who asks: This verse is saying: One of them: that there is no renovation in it.And the second: that there is a ritual in it.On the one in the sense of the future, that you see that “it will not“ confirm what it denies it “no” and the Khalil said in “it will not”: its origin is not, if it is proven, then it is not said that it is not.I do in the future what you ask of me from the worship of your god With a servant of your servants, and you are not in the immediate worshipers of my servants.The second face: to turn the matter and make the first for the state, and the second to the one who is upright, and the evidence is that he said: I do not worship what you worshiped for the sake To understand our saying: I worship what you worshiped, and there is no doubt that this is for the sake of the way that it is that if he said: I am a fierce, so I understand it.The third direction: Some of them said: Each of them is suitable for the situation and for the future, but we allocate one of them in the case, and the second is in the interest of the one who is the one who is the same It is informed of the situation, then about the ritual, then it is the installation, and if we say: first tell the exclusion; Because he is the one who called him to him, then he was the most important and he started with it, because it was said: What is the benefit of the news about the situation and it was known that he did not worship the idol, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who worshiped the idol, Some of the conditions?We said: As for the story about itself, the ignorance does not delude it that he worshiped it as a secret of it, or asking for it, and its exile of their worshipers; Because the verb of the infidel is not a worship in the first place.The loyal face: It is the choice of my father, Muslim, that the intended one of the first worshipers.With the verb in the interpretation of the source, that is, I do not worship your sacrificed worship on the evil and leave the view, nor do you worship my worshipers, the best of the two You worship my God, that was false; Because worship is a deed that is commanded by it, and what you do, you are from it, and it is not commanded by it.The fifth face: that the first to be carried on the negation of the advertisement that they mentioned, and the second on the general negation of the entirety of all the flaws, so that it is the first, he said: You worship, please, to worship God, nor do you worship God, please worship your idols, then he said: And I do not worship your idol for the sake The purposes, and the intended of the boundary of the face of the faces: nor do you worship what you worship in the face of the face The injustice is for the abuse of enlistment, and he says: I do not oppress the supplies of sleep, but I do not darkens the origin of the origin, not because of this symptoms, nor for the purposes of the purposes.The second saying: It is that we receive the crops of the renovation, and on this virgin saying from it from three of the faces: the first: that the deception benefits the confirmation and the word is the same as the need, and the most likely is the need.The prodigy is better, and there is no position that needs to be affordable from this position; Because these disbelievers have returned to the Messenger of God ﷺ in this meaning, and the Messenger of God silenced the answer, so he fell into their hearts that he is the one who has peace be upon them Molly, so the need called the need to confirm and repeat this negation and abuse.The second face: that the Qur’an was descending after anything, and after a verse, a blindness is what they ask, so the participants said: He greeted us after the family, so we will be after you So God revealed: nor I worship what you worshiped, nor do you worship what I worshiped, then they said after a period: our gods worship our month and worship, and I will worship, and I will not worship You worship what I worshiped, and when this was mentioned, we were not imprisoned.The third face: that the infidels mentioned that word two times, the gods of our gods are a month and worship your God as a month and worship our god (P-136) The answer to the confusion of their saying, and it is a beating of the assumption, for whoever repeats the word one for a pardoned abuse that is accompanied by the payment of that The renovation is shook by it and a despicableness of his saying.The second question: In the verse a question, which is that the word: (What) does not take over whoever knows, so he gave that their worshipers were like that, so he was correct to express it.Prayer and peace be upon him is the knowledge of the two worlds, so how did he say: nor do you worship what you worship, they answered from him from his face You worship the truth.And the second: that “what” is a source in the two sentences, as if he said: I do not worship your servants and do not worship my servants in the future, then he said second: I do not worship My worshipers are immediately.And the third: to be “what” in the sense of the one who is then correct.And he paid it: that when he said first: I do not worship what you worship the second bears of it, so that the words are coated as his saying: and a bad isolation of the same [40].The third question: The people of al -Jabr needed that it is the highest of them.The thing is that it is necessary for the presence of that thing.In the verse of Qalaat: The first question: Is not that the male of the face, which is for the sake of the sake of the worship of God other than God, was the first of this repentance?The answer, but it may be affirming and repeating the first to mention the argument, either because the addressee with a dilat The place of the conflict is in the end of the appearance, so the debate is in the question of algebra and al -Qadir is good.He kills him, and if he is not able to kill him, he must insult him, and the exaggeration in denying it is as in this verse.The second question: that the first of the surah is a delusion of tension, which is the call with disbelief and freshness, and the last of it is for the pleasure and the leniency, and it is his saying: for you, and for you, and for you.Between the two things?The answer: As if he says: I have gone out in your warning about this matter, and I did not shorten it, if you did not accept my saying, then let me leave me.The third question: When the repetition was for the sake of affirmation and the exaggeration, it would have been said to say: I will not worship what you worship; Because this is the most generous, you do not see that the companions of the cave when they were tempted, they said: We will not call from it without God [Al -Kahf: 14].The answer: The exaggeration is that it is needed in the position of accusation, and every one of the Muhammad, peace be upon him, has known that he did not worship the idol before the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who worshiped it, After the appearance of the law, with the disagreement of the companions of the cave, then it was found from that before.
