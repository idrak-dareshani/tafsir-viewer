The researcher of the Qurâ€™an is up to him: If they are said to them, follow what God has revealed, they said, but follow what we have left for our fathers, and their parents were not reasonable.Know that they disagreed in the bloodshed in his saying: (they have) on three sayings: one of them: that he is a good at (who) in his saying: Whoever takes from the one who takes from the one who takes from God The Arabs, and their remembrance was preceded.And the second: He returns to (people) in his saying: O people, so he refrained from the addressee to the Maghreb on the way of tafs, exaggerated in the two misguidance, as if he said: Look at these beans what they say.And the third of it: Ibn Abbas said: It came down to the Juda, and then when the Messenger of God called them to Islam, so they said: We follow what we found for us, and our fathers were from us, and they were good for us The verse is insignificant, and the seduction is in (them) that goes back to the unknown, except that the bloodshed may come back to the information, as he returns to the remembrance of them They said: Rather, we follow what our fathers have, and in which there are questions: You affect [Al -Ala: 16] and Nun, but we follow, and the rituals are the one [Al -Mutaffifin: 36] and the cinema, but it was asked [Yusuf: 18] and the Zaye is, but Zain [Al -Raad: 33] You thought and the goodness, but rather the woman [Women: 155], and the most readers are on the emergence, and among them is those who agree with it in some, and the purification is the original.The second question: our fullness in the sense of our found, with the evidence of his exalted saying in another verse: Rather, we follow what we found our fathers [Luqman: 21] And Alafia, his master, to the door [Yusuf: 25] and his saying: They are a lofty (P-7), their fathers are lost [Al-Safat: 69].* * * The third question: the meaning of the verse: that God Almighty commanded them that they follow what God has revealed from the brilliant evidence, so they said: We do not follow that As if they knew the connotation by imitation, and God answered their words of them with his saying: If their fathers were not reasonable, they did not understand anything and do not guided in it: The compassion, the thunderbolt of the possibly entered into the meaning of the stake and the distress.Because it requires the declaration of something that is clear with it, as it requires the interrogation of the arrogance of the one who is accused of it.The second question: the report of this answer is from the faces: one of it: to be said to the imam: Do you know that the condition of the pamble of the person is the one who knows the human being?If you know that we did not know that it is imitated only after you know that it was right, so how did you know that it is right?And if you know him with another imitation Single is necessary, and if you know it with the mind, then that is enough, then there is no need for imitation, and if you say: It is not from the condition of the permissibility of its imitation, that it is known to know it.You have come to imitate it, and if it is invalid, then you are on your imitation, you do not know that you are right or void.And the second: He endowed that that advanced was a scholar of this thing, but if we were able to do so that the advanced was what was aware of that thing, then it is not the same, and it is not the time What were you doing?So it is possible that that advanced is not found, nor his gold, which must be from the same to the view, so this is here.And the third of it: If you imitate those before you, then the advanced, how did you know it?I defined it with imitation or not by imitation?If you know him with imitation, it is necessary for either the rotation or the seizure, and if you know it, not by imitation, but rather with a sign, then if you are obligated to imitate this Knowledge of spoiler, not by imitation; Because if you were asked for imitation, not with evidence, with that the advanced, he asked him for spoilers, not by imitation, you were in violation of him, and he was not able to do so It is proven to his negation, and it will be false.The third question: Rather, the Almighty mentioned this verse, the obstacle of the dirt from following the steps of Satan, alerting it to the fact that there is no difference between the followers of the follower, and the followers of the Recruitment, in which there is the strongest indication of the path of view and the recipient, and the leaving of reflection on what falls in the thoughtful, without a sign, or on what he says.The following question: Its saying: They do not understand anything for general memorizers, and it is meaningful; Because they were reasonable for many matters of this world, this indicates the permissibility of the year of the year with the fact that what is meant by its own.The fifth question: His saying: They do not understand anything that is intended that they do not know anything of religion, and the Almighty said: They do not guided the intention that they are not guided.
