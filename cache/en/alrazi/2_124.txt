The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: And when Abraham was afflicted with his Lord with words, they came to him, he said that I made you for people as an imam who said, and from my offspring, he said that he does not obtain the pledge When he remedied in the evil of his blessings on the sons of Israel, then in the explanation of their dome in their condemnation and their houses, and the seal of this chapter is what he started Remember my grace to his saying: They are not victorious, the grace of his grace is here in another type of Bayan, which is that he mentioned the story of the Prophet, peace be upon him, In it that the righteous of peace be upon him is a person who is preferred by all the kindness and boredom, so the two participants were those who are aware of the preference He will be his sanctity and his homes, and the people of the book from the Jews and the Christians were also coupled with its preference.Things that are obligated to the participants, the Jews, and the Christians accept the saying of Muhammad ﷺ and the confession in his religion and the purpose of his law, and his two sons: In some way, when he fulfilled it and removed from its covenant, there is no crime that received the Prophet and the Imam By leaving the frequency, stubbornness and purity of the ruling of God Almighty and his destruction.And the second: He transcended him that he asked the imam for his children, so God Almighty said: The covenant of the unjust does not obtain, so that the imam is not attributed to the imam, and the imam is not in the imam.So, when they wanted and the seeds of this position, they must leave the chicken and intolerance to the invalidity.And the third of it: that the pilgrimage is one of the characteristics of Muhammad's religion ﷺ, and God has told that of Ibrahim to be like that, such as the pilgrimage to Jews and the Christians in the hearts of the one.And the one who was subjected to it: that the kiss was transferred to the kaaba, the hardship of that is on the Jew and the Christians, so God showed that this house is before the rituals The ritual of it was what was required of that, that is angry about their hearts.Fifthly: that among those who are interpreters who interpreted the words that God Almighty has completed the righteousness of it with matters that he will take to the cleanliness of the body, and this is what is required This is the way because they were the preferences of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and they are obliged to leave what they were from the staining and the domination of the domination and the domination Whoever interprets those words, since his honor is upon him, peace be upon him.For the rulers of God Almighty in the sacrifice of the boy And the meeting in the fire, and this requires these Jews, Christians and the participants who are recognized by its grace to resemble it in that and do not like it.The envy, the protective and the purpose of the purpose of Muhammad ﷺ, for this guilt that is for the sake of which God is the Almighty’s story, the story of His Excellency, peace be upon him.And he knew that he was transcended from Ibrahim, peace be upon him, things that he returned to some of the hard things that he assigned to him, and some of them return to the evil of the good.With it, and we will come to its interpretation, if God wills, the Almighty, and this verse is indicative of a cost that he obtained after him.* * * As for the seduction, the Almighty said: And when his Lord is bound by his Lord with words, they gave them and in which there are questions: the first question: The owner of the scout said: And remember when he was dumped, or when they were trapped, he was Kit and Kit; Either he said I made you.The second question: that it is the highest and its cost is it in the bonds of expanding, because the example of this is from us on the side of the balby, the annexation, and the one who does not know.Whoever commands him, when there is a lot of that in the knowledge between us, it is permissible for God to describe his command and forbid him with that, because he is not permitted, and it is not permissible for him to be blessed.A scholar of all the information that is not ended for it on the way of detailing from eternal to the forefront, and Hesham ibn al -Hakam said: He was in the eternal, a scholar of the truth of the truth Those of those who are the halls and their entry into the existence, so it is high that he only knows when they are fractured, and he was invoked by the verse and the mind, but the verse is that it is the verse.By his worshipers, his servants, and his reference to his counterparts in the verses of the verses, as his saying, is up to him: and let us know you until we know the two of you and those who are blessed: 31] Let it be good, which is the best work [Hood: 7] and he said in this surah after that: and let us give you anything of fear and hunger [the cow: 155] The goat is the one who said it: He said to him a soft saying that he may remember or fear [Taha: 44] and the word (perhaps) to the excess and said: Oh, oh, oh You created you and those who are before you, that you may fear [the cow: 21].The mind was referred to faces: one of them: that he was upset, even if he was a scholar of the fall of things before and its fall, then the exile of the ability is about the creator, and for the sake of the creation, The likeness of the mandate: that what God has known is the Almighty and its fall is angry that it does not fall because the knowledge of the mourning of the thing and without the occurrence of that thing and the one who is the opposite The two are referred, and so God knows that he was not falling into the eyes of this sign, and if the barrier was a scholar of all the parts of the parts before and before it, it was not.And some of it is forbidden to fall, nor the ability to be at all over the obligation, nor on the forbidden, so the exile of the ability is required for these things from the Creator, but the one who is the one who is the creator of the creator It is referred to the right of the Creator, because it has been proven that the world is modern and has a influencer, and that influenced must be able to be able, if if it was obligatory for the self of his soul The world, or from the edge of the world, is its entirety, but in the right of creation, we are found from our soul شِئْنا الفِعْلَ قَدَرْنا عَلَيْهِ, وإنْ شِئْنا التَّرْكَ قَدَرْنا عَلى التَّرْكِ, فَلَوْ كانَ أحَدُهُما واجِبًا والآخَرُ مُمْتَنِعًا لَما حَصَلَتْ هَذِهِ المُكْنَةُ الَّتِي يُعْرَفُ ثُبُوتُها With the harm.And the second: that the knowledge is related to one of the knowledgeable people, so that it can be attached to the other information The other attachment, even if the two attachment was one of the reign of that, because the one thing is that it will be the same He was a scholar of all these parties, for him to have a highly inferior science, or if his knowledge was attached to it, it is not complete, and on the authority of the two Under, uninterrupted, and this is a one, because the group of these things is more than that of that group with his eyes, with a long time It is dirty, and the increase increased the one who is twenty, and the one who is informed if it is included to him other than the one who is the one who is the one who is died, then the things are provided to him.The fence is the knowledge, but that comment is a relative matters that are not available in the artisan.That comment has the same thing, it is necessary that science should not be knowledgeable in the same matter and that is referred.And the third of it: that this information that is not ended for it, does God know its number or does not know, if you know its number, then it is a good thing, because all of it is what it is It is dead, and if God did not know its number, it was not aware of it on the way of detail, and our words are only in detailing.And its elevation: that every knowledge is distinguished in the mind, what is its promise, and every distinctive is what is meant, because what is meant is out of it, and everything that comes out of it, then it is so Remarked, it is dead, so everything that is not forbidden is that it is known to be known.Fifth: The thing is only a teacher If the knowledge had to be attached to it and a relative to it and the affiliation of the thing to the thing, it is considered that its investigation is considered in itself, so if it is not for the one who is in the same way It is impossible for him to be for him from where he is a lineage, and the diagnosed thing before his entry into the existence was not a person who is not lying in the time of the time Knowledge, then it was said: This is invalidated by the places and compounds before its entry into the existence, so we know it, and if it is not the inspection of the bitterness, this is the time of the bit, the one who said: We will be overwhelmed by our words, and there is no answer for our words, and that is what does not remove suspicion and suspicion.Hisham said: This is the mind of the mind that does not refer to it.Its worse.He knew that Hicham was the head of the rejectionist, so that the feet of the opponent of the ritual said to the saying of the infection.He knows the parties before their fall, and they needed them before their fall, it is correct to be known to God Almighty, but we have said that it is true that it is true that it is good.Because we know it before its fall, we know that the sun tomorrow is lifted from its outskirts, and the fall indicates that it is possible, but our saying is that it is not true.To be a knowledge of God Almighty, because the knowledge of God is attached to the knowledge of the information that has been proven to him for himself, so it is not related to what he knows, Other than that, if the specialization is obtained, he would not be discontinued, and that is referred, so he must not be attached to anything from the information in the first place, even if it is related to it.He is the one who is required.As for the first suspicion: the answer to it is that the knowledge of the fall is a follower of the fog.As for the second suspicion: the answer to it: it is exhibited by the proximity of the numbers that are not ended.As for the third suspicion: the answer is for it: that God is exalted, and its number does not know, and it is not necessary to prove ignorance, because the ignorance is that there is a number of people, no Its number, but if it is not a number of themselves, it is not (P-34) that is obligatory from our saying: God Almighty does not know its number to prove ignorance.As for the loud suspicion: the answer is for it: that it is not from the condition of the knowledge that the knowledge knows that it is distinguished from others, because the knowledge is distinguished by his knowledge That is, if if the knowledge was standing with the knowledge of the knowledge of its distinction from others, and it has proven that the knowledge is that it is distinguished from it.A person knows one thing unless he knows things that are not ended.As for the fifth suspicion: the answer On the authority of it, which we mentioned, and if the suspicion is broken, it will be taken, so what we mentioned from the significance of the world of the world of God, may God bless you Exclusivity.* * * The third question: Know that the guerrilla must be domesticated to a previously mentioned male, so the guarantee is either that it is presented to the reminder, and it is noticeable.It is delayed from him and a sense, or that it is advanced and delayed, or the meaning of it, or it is the opposite of it.As for the first section: It is that it is possible to preserve and mean, so what is surprised by the grammarians is that it is not permissible, and the son of my gin has said, As for the poetry, he said: “His Lord, on me, is my son, Bin Hatim, the part of the obese dogs, and he did.They are intense, so no one of them was fed up to the other in the word, then we all gathered on that if the tendency was presented to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the sake of the sake It was not presented with that of the adherence is permissible.The second division: It is that the annex is delayed and meaningful, and this is not a conflict in his health, as your saying: the increase in his boy.The third division: that the guerrilla is advanced in the memorizer, delayed in the meaning, and it is like your saying: He struck his servant is more, so we are the opposite, and if it is in the authority of the ritual It is delayed in the meaning, because the tendency is delayed from the Marifa in the estimation, and it becomes as if you said: a further struck his servant, so it was not permissible.The loyal division: that the guerrilla is advanced in the meaning, delayed in the memorizers, and it is like his Almighty saying: And when he was broken by his Lord, then the Murfa is the one who is in the way Al -Mansoub, and the estimation becomes: when his Lord is overlooked by his Lord, except that the matter, even if it is, according to the meaning Recently, not a good.The following question: Ibn Amir read: “Abraham” with a thousand among the distraction and the Mim, and the rest of the “Ibrahim” are two languages, and the son of Abbas and Abu Hayyah read His Lord, “by lifting Abraham and the installation of his Lord, and the meaning is that he called him the words of the supplication, so the test of the test is answered by God.The fifth question: the interpreters were different in that the appearance of the memorial does not indicate those words or not?And some of them said: The memorizer is indicated by it, which is the one who mentioned God, the imamate, and the purification of the house, and raising its barriers and supplication with the urbanization of Muhammad, Strongly, as for the imamate, because what is meant by it is the prophecy, and this cost is a great hardship, because the Prophet ﷺ is obligated to carry a whole The hardships and troubles are in the way of the message, and that they do not take anything from it, and if the killing would have been obliged to do so, there is no doubt that that is one of the greatest of the hardships, and that is the reward of this The greatest of the reward of others, and the building of the house and its purification and raising its barriers, then whoever stands on what was narrated in how it is his knowledge of his knowledge (p-35) The residence of your suffering is included, and God is the best of the prayer, peace and blessings be upon him, with the standing in the standing of the throwing of the gossip and otherwise Muhammad ﷺ at the end of time, for this is what needs to be the salvation of the work of God Almighty, and the removal of envy from the heart in the kidneys, so you have proven that the affairs are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one A hard -and -severe thickening, so I can be intended to be of God, the Almighty, with the words, is that, then the one who indicates that the person who wants it is that it is that He separated a letter from the forefathers of kindness, and he did not accept, and he said: I make you for people as an imam.The mentioned matters, and the judge was subjected to this saying, and he said: This is permissible, even if God said: “And when he was brought up with his Lord, his Lord is a word, so he said: After that: I make you an imam for people, so they will not be blessed, except that it is not like that, but he mentioned his saying: I make you for the people of the imam after saying: He is the Almighty with the words of the words, and he brought them to Abraham, then he is up to him after that: I make you for people as an imam, and he can be answered by the imam of the imam Just, but the imamate, build the house, and purify it, and the supplication in the mission of Muhammad ﷺ, as if God is up to Him, he was brought up with the group of these things, so he told him, so he is the one who is the one who is the one who has the same With matters on the nomads, then he told him that he has fulfilled it, then he followed that with explanation and detailing, and this is what is not far from it.The second saying: that the appearance of the verse is not a sign of it in which it is intended for this word, and this saying is imitated by and faced: And his talents, as if he was up to the Almighty, said: When Abraham was afflicted with his Lord with words of what he wanted, he wrapped it with the matter of it.And the second face: in the words that are from Abraham to which his people speak to, that is, he informs them of them, and those who say about the first face, so they disagreed with the fact that it was the same.One of it: Ibn Abbas said: It is the tenth of the qualities that were avolor for his law and it is Sunnah on our part, five in the head and five in the body, but the one in the head: And the separation of the head, the storytelling of the mustac Variety, depletion of tuning, congestion of the wrapping, and successful water.And the second: Some of them said: They walked it with thirty as a thirteen of Islam, one of them in Surah Badha: The repentants are the games [the repentance: 112] to the last of the verse, and the last of the verse, The Muslims and Muslim women [the parties: 35] to the last of the verse, and ten of them in the believers: the believers have succeeded [the believers: 1] to the saying [The believers: 10] And he narrated ten in: He asked a question [Al -Maaraj: 1] to his saying: Those who are on their prayers are preserved [Al -Ma’agh: 34] so he made it for the sake Abbas.And the third: He commanded it with the pilgrims, such as the circumambulation, the pursuit, the throw, and the forbidden, and it is the saying of Qutah and Ibn Abbas.And its booster: they wrapped it with seven things: the sun, the moon, the shackles, and the betrayal of the old, the fire, the sacrifice of the boy, and the migration, then fulfill the words of God, so he said: He who fulfilled [Al -Najam: 37] on the authority of Hassan.Fifthly: that what is meant is what he mentioned in his saying: His Lord said to him, Islam said, I became Muslim to the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Qarah: 131].And its sixth: the many debates in the neutrality with his father and his people, with a porridge, prayer, zakat, fasting, and the division of singing, the guest, and the patience.Al -Qafil, may God have mercy on him, said: The sentence of saying is that the abuse is the commitment of everything in its action, a cost, a severity, and a hardship, for the sake of the word is the same.And each one of them is taken, and if the novel would be established in all, the saying must be made, and if the narration (P-36) would be established in some without the time, then the time These narratives, so it is obligatory to stop, and God knows.The sixth question: The judge said: This is the case, but it was before the prophecy, because God Almighty alerted that his resurrection is upon him, peace and blessings of God The reason is presented to the caused, so this is the case with the existence of the existence of the imam, and this is also a fullness of the issues of the mind شَرائِطِ النُّبُوَّةِ لا يَحْصُلُ إلّا بِالإعْراضِ عَنْ جَمِيعِ مَلاذِّ الدُّنْيا وشَهَواتِها وتَرْكِ المُداهَنَةِ مَعَ الخَلْقِ وتَقْبِيحِ ما هم عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الأدْيانِ الباطِلَةِ والعَقائِدِ الفاسِدَةِ, The harm is carried out from all kinds of creation, and there is no doubt that this meaning is one of the greatest of hardship and the sake of the food, and for this reason, the Messenger is upon him the prayer and peace be upon him.Likewise, God Almighty, who will be afflicted with the hard climb, and when he was praying and peace be upon him, he did not give him a crime that gave him the breach of the prophecy and the message.Others said: After the prophecy, because he is peace and peace be upon him, he does not know that he is a cost of that His knowledge of his being like that, the judge answered him that he is tolerated that he is the highest inspired by him to the tongue of Jabril, peace be upon him, with this.He made him a prophet who is in absentia to creation, if you know this question, then say the judge said: It is permissible for the person to be intended to be what the good and the hadeeth mentioned the hadeeth of the hadeeth, So, peace and blessings be upon him, may God bless him before the prophecy, as for the slaughter of the child, the migration, and the fire, all of that was after the noble, and the time, and the time, and the time, and the time, and the time, It is narrated that he had seen himself and his age was one hundred and ten years.Then he said: If the hearing is the mourning of the one that is intended for the words of these things, it was what is meant by his saying: (I am careful) that he is the one who knew it) They are fulfilled and they are after the prophecy.The seven question: the annexes who are reluctant to do in one of the two readings of Abraham in the sense of the meaning And it is.And the like: and Abraham who fulfilled [Al -Najam: 37] and in the last of God Almighty in the sense: He gave him what he asked for, and nothing was shortened from him.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: I make you an imam, the imam is the name of those who are concerned with it as a visit to what is associated with it, that is, they take care of you in your debt.And in it is the issues: the first question: the people of the investigator said: What is meant by the Imam is the Prophet, and it is indicated by his face For all people who are like that, it must be a messenger from God, who is independent of the journey, because if he was a follower of another Messenger, there is no one for you.His imam, then the general heroes.And the second: that the memorizer indicates that he is an imam in everything that is like that, and it must be a prophet.And the third of it: The Prophet, peace be upon them, is imams where they are obligated to follow them.Imams because they arranged in the place that must follow them and accept their saying and their rulers, judges and jurisprudence as well as the imams of this meaning It is also called an imam because whoever entered his prayers, his fulfillment is obligated to him, and peace and blessings be upon him.Chew on your imam, "and you have proven that the name of the imam for those who deserved to be fulfilled in the debt and may be called this, too Imams call for fire [Al-Qasas: 41] except that (P-37) the name of the Imam does not take over On the launch, but only a restriction is used, for when he mentioned the imams of the misguidance, he restricted it with the words The truth, as for the slaves of falsehood, it is called the name of God with the restriction, God Almighty said: So what is sang of them from their God who is the one who calls from the one who is called And he said: And look at your god, which you have shadow, "Taha: 97] If it is proven that the name of the imam will be informed of what we mentioned, and you have proven that the prophet is at the highest paths of the imam.It is upon him, because God is the Almighty, and the imam has been preserved here in the disposal of the two of the two, so that the grace of that is the greatest of blessings to be good Carrying this imam on the prophecy.The second question: that God is exalted, when he promised him that he will make him an imam for people.In contradiction, they glorify Abraham, peace and blessings be upon him, and they will be honored by affiliation with him, either in the proportions, or in religion and validity, even if the slave of the first people was May the peace be upon him, and God Almighty said in his book: Then we inspired us to follow the religion of Abraham Hanifa [Al -Nahl: 123] and he said: And whoever desires from the mourning [Al -Qarra: 130] And he said in the last Surah Al -Hajj: The mourning of your father, Ibrahim, is the poison of Muslims before [Al -Hajj: 78] and all the nation of Muhammad, peace be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him Prayer: And the mercy of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you prayed, blessed, and merciful to Abraham, and on the family of Abraham.The third question: those who say that the imam does not become an imam except by the text, holding this verse, and they said: He is the Almighty, that he has become an imam with the imam of the imam.And his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: I am in the land of the earth in emotion [the cows: 30], so he indicated that he does not obtain the position of disagreement with the prescription for him, and this is a weakness.With the imam, here is the prophecy, then if we are intended to be the divorced of the imam, but the verse indicates that the text is the way of the imam and that is not a dispute in it The imam is proven by the text, and in this verse, there is no exposure to this question, neither by the negation nor by the evidence.The following question: His saying: I make you an imam that indicates that peace be upon him was informed of all sins, because the imam is the one who does not do it The disobedience was issued from it, and it is obligatory for us to feed on it in that, so it is necessary for us to do the disobedience to us, and that is referred to it because it is a disobedience to it.It is varied by his act and his universe واجِبًا عِبارَةٌ عَنْ كَوْنِهِ مَمْنُوعًا مِن تَرْكِهِ والجَمِيعُ مُحالٌ.* * * As for his saying: And from my offspring, he has an important question: the first question: the offspring: the children and the children of the children of the man, and it is one of the atoms of God, the creation of the creation, and the creation of God.As they left in the wilderness, and there is another side, which is to be fabricated to the atom.The second question: His saying and from my offspring is kind to the kaf, as if he said: He made some of my offspring as it is said to you: I will ask you, and I will say: The third question: Some of them said: He is the highest of his knowledge that in his offspring is a prophet, so he wanted to know that this is in all of them or in the same way For this matter?So God Almighty knows that they are unjust, and it is not possible for that.And (P-38) said: “Peace be upon him, he mentioned that on the path of the media, and when he did not know the face The oppressors of them, if it was said: Was Abraim, peace be upon him, was permissible in his saying: And from my offspring, or was it not permissible in it?If the ears of God be exalted in this supplication, then did he return his supplication?And if he did not give permission for him in it, then we said: His saying: And from my offspring indicates that peace be upon him, he asked for some of the offspring of the God has fulfilled the answer of his prayers in the believers from his offspring, such as listening, Isaac, Jacob, Sawaf, Moses, Harun, Dawad, Silman, and Ya And he made the last of them Muhammad ﷺ from his offspring, which is the best of the prophets and imams, peace be upon them.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty: He said that the covenant of the unjust does not obtain, in his books: The first question: He read a Hamza and a thief about the authority of the pledge, and the rest of it.Some of them do not obtain my covenant of the unjust, that is, whoever is unjust from your offspring, because he does not obtain my covenant.The second question: they mentioned in the covenant with faces: one of them: that this covenant is the imam that is mentioned before, then if that of that imam is the Prophet, then no.And the second: My covenant, that is, my mercy on a gift.And the third: I obey me from the laughter.And its elevation: Amani on the authority of Abu Ubaid, and the first saying is the first because his saying: And from my offspring is a request for that imam who is the one who is in it with his saying: The covenant of the unjust does not obtain, it is not a answer to that question unless it is intended for this era that the imam.The third question: the verse indicates that he will give some of his children what he asked, and if not for that the answer was: No, or he says: He will not be attributed to me Ibrahim, peace be upon him, is a scholar that the prophecy does not fit the shadows?We said: Yes, but he did not know the state of his offspring, so God has shown the Almighty that In them, who is this case, and that the prophecy is to those who are not in vain.The following question: The arms took this verse to praise in the imam of Abu Bakr and Omar, may God be pleased with them, from three of the faces: They were the case of their disbelievers, so they must be believed in that case that they do not receive the covenant The imamate is bitten, nor in any of the facts, it is proven that they do not cross the imam.The second: Whoever was a sinner in the interior was one of the oppressors, then he did not know that Abu Bakr and the age of what they were from the oppressors are guilty and not in the right وذَلِكَ إنَّما يَثْبُتُ في حَقِّ مَن تَثْبُتُ عِصْمَتُهُ ولَمّا لَمْ يَكُونا مَعْصُومَيْنِ بِالِاتِّفاقِ وجَبَ أنْ لا تَتَحَقَّقَ إمامَتُهُما البَتَّةَ.The third: They said: They were two parties, and every shadow and the shadow are not attained by the era of the imam, so it is necessary that the era of the imam should not be attained, but they were not.The shame is an unjust, so the Almighty said: The blessing is a great injustice [Lumanman: 13].Their disbelief, after the disbelief of the disbelievers, this name does not remain because we say the oppressor who is found from the darkness, and our saying: The darkness is found from it from the one who says: The injustice in the past or immediately with an indication is that this concept can be divided into these two divisions, and the uniqueness of the division is with the division of the division of the division of the division It is partized between the two sections, which is required to be over, because one of the two divisions is required, so it is not necessary from the denial of its unjust immediate In view of the legal evidence that the sleeping is called a believer and faith is the belief and belief that he has the same as a sleeping as a sleep, so he indicated that it was a believer that was a believer.Before, and if this is proven, it must be unjust to a injustice that was found before, and also, then the words are a dormant for a ritual lethality, and the walker is a storm of the sake Punishment, so the group of those things are not overlooked, and if the one who was derived from it was a condition in the place of the derivative of the name of the one who is the one And the calamities and their proverbs are true in the origin of the origin, and that it is invalid, so this indicated that the derivative of the derivative of it is not a condition for the formation of the name of the one The answer: All you mentioned is opposite, since it is a solution that does not surrender to a disbeliever, so he greeted a believer in the case of a believer in the case, except that he was a disbeliever before, so he was not.It was indicated on what we said, and because the repentance of the infidelity is no It is called a disbeliever and the repentance of the disobedience is not called disobedience, so the saying in its organs, not to see it to say it: and do not leave it to those who wronged [Hood: 113] To them if they resided on the darkness, and his saying: What is on the good of the path [the repentance: 91] with its meaning: they did not rise on the charity, on the authority of the Imam, from the Imam that the Imam is from the Imam The verse: The prophecy, so whoever disbelieves in God is a kind of eyes, then he does not reconcile the prophecy.* * * The fifth question: The public said of the jurisprudence and the two speakers: The immorality is the state of his immorality, the imam’s contract is not permissible for him, and they are different in the fact that the immorality of the imam no?And the public took over that the evildoer does not reconcile the imam for him with this verse, and the face of the one who is stated with it from two sides: the first: the first thing: The oppressors are an answer to his saying: And from my offspring and his saying: And from my offspring is a request for the imam of the imam that God Almighty mentioned, so it is necessary for the sake of this Let the answer be a pursuit of the question, so the verse will be issued as if it is up to the exalted, he said: The imam does not obtain the imams who are unjust, and every disobedience is that it is unjust to its soul, so the verse was not.If it is said: The appearance of the verse requires the adoption of their unjust and unjust and inwardly, and that is not valid in the imams and judges, we said: As for the Shiites, they will be done The validity of their saying in the path of infidelity is back and inner.If it was said: Is it not that peace be upon him, he said: Glory be to you that I was among the unjust [the Prophet: 87] and Adam said: Our Lord is our oppression of our souls: The absolute injustice, and this is not exerted in Adam, and peace be upon them.The second face: The era may be used in the book of God in the sense of the matter.Exalted: They said that God has pledged to us [Al -Amran: 183] means our command, and from it the intelligence of the creator to their princes and their judges if it is proven that it is the era of God His saying: The covenant of the unjust is not attained that he wants that the oppressors are not commanders, and that the oppressors are not permissible to be in the place of those who are accepted The first direction of the convention of Muslims is overwhelmed by the rules of God (P-40), for the perseverance of those who are obligated to others, for others, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the other On the orders of God, the Exalted, and without them, they will not be imams in the debt, so you have proven the verse of the verse of the imam of the evildoer, and he said: The disobedience of the Creator.It is not presented to the prayer, and if he is in terms of if he is expelled with him, then he does not spoil his prayers, Abu Bakr Al -Razi said: And from the people who think that the father of Hanaf is that he is a man The evildoer is an imam and a successor, and it is not permissible as a judge, he said: This is a mistake, and the father of Hanifa did not separate between the caliphs and the ruler in that the condition of each one is one of them He is a successor and his narration is not acceptable, and its rulings are not so as a way The judiciary, and his heat, so he prevented from that, and the son of Habira urged him and made him set him every day as a day.Something was until the warning disappeared, and he took over to him the enemy of the milk that enters it, so he left it, and then the victim was invited to the same as the one that was for him until that until he was so He is set to the brightness of the city of Al -Mansour to the example of that and his story in the matter of Zayd ibn Ali Mashoura, and in his pregnancy money to him and his sects of people in the secret of the people in the authority With him, and he was with his command with Muhammad and Abraham, the son of Abdullah bin Al -Hassan, he said: Rather, he who mixed with this narration is that he said: He himself, and he takes over the judiciary from an unfair imam.So I do not adopt in that with his wali, because the one who has been in the house of his elders, and the judge’s agents, and the condition of the judge to be an entirety not to see that the family of the country is not They gathered on the consent of a man who just a man who is justice until they were the agents of those who prevented the acceptance of his rulings, if his judgment was not for him The face of an imam, no sultan, and God knows.The sixth question: the verse indicates the infallibility of the prophets from two faces: the first: that it has been proven that what is meant from this covenant is: the imam, and there is no doubt that all the imam is the imam It is concerned with it, and the Prophet is the first of the people, and if the verse indicates that the imam is not a pioneer, then it indicates that the Messenger is not permissible to be a perpetrator of the one who is an act of the one.The second: He said: The covenant of the unjust does not obtain this covenant, if it is the prophecy; You must be no one of the unjust, even if it is the imam, so that is because every prophet must be inevitable and that it is an imam who is entrusted with it, and every pharm Get up The prophecy of one of the evildoers, and God knows.The following question: Know that he was greeting him, showing that he has a covenant with you, and you have a covenant with you, and he showed that when you fulfill your covenant, then what is it.And fulfill my covenant, I will fulfill your covenant.And those who are in their covenant if they pledged [Al -Baqarah: 177] and he said: Those who are for their secretariats and their covenant are sponsors [the believers: 8] and he said: O you who are safe 1 God [repentance: 111] Then he explained how his covenant is to our father Adam, and he said: And we have pledged to Adam before we forgot, and we did not find him with a core: He pledged to us and said: (p-41) Did I not pledge to you, my son, Adam [Yass: 60] Then he explained the way of his covenant with the children Amr: 183] Then he explained how he covenant with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon them, and he said: We were covered to Abraham and Asmail [Al -Baqarah: 125] His covenant does not reach the oppressors, and he said: He does not obtain the covenant of the oppressors.So we say: The covenant taken from you is nothing but the covenant of servitude and servitude, and the covenant that God is glorified, exalted, from his face, but the righteousness of the Lord, If he contemplates in the event of this pledge, he did not find anything from his soul, except that this covenant will be destroyed, and from his Lord, except for the covenant, let us be in the shadow of this door, then this is the one who is in the shadow of this.You have to create creation, creation, life, and give the mind and the machine, and what is meant by all of that is your dedication to obedience, servitude and servitude to what he said: He did not create [Al -Darayat: 56] And his soul was removed from this creation and creation from it on the way of the messenger, and he said: We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them: We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them is invalid, that thought those who disbelieved [p.The way of detailing is what is judgment in creation and creation, and he said: I did not create gin and humanity except to worship [Al -Dhariyat: 56], so it is his grace and the covenant of the Lord of the Lord And blessed you with the faces of the blessings and made you a distinctive sane, so if you do not occupy his servants, obedience and servitude The covenant of your servants has passed you with the fact that God Almighty has fulfilled the covenant of his grapes.And the second: that the covenant of the grapes requires giving the hypocrisy and the guidance and the covenant of the servants from you requires the grandfather and the dowry in the work, then it is a loyal Leave an atom of the atoms, unless he made it a guiding for you to the path of the truth, and if it is nothing but praise with his praise [Al -Asra: 44], and you did not fulfill the time with the custody of the one.And the third of it: that the grace of God with faith is the greatest of blessings, and the evidence is that this is the grace, if you missed you, you would have been the most severe of the hardships, the forefathers, the forefathers, The blessing is from God Almighty for his saying: And what is with you from the grace, and from God [Al -Nahl: 53] Then with this that this grace is from it, then it is for you and he said: Thank you [Al -Asra: 19], if God is the Almighty, thank you for this grace, then you thank him for what was given from the success and the guidance, then it was the first, then it was the first, then the first, then the first, then the first What he said: The human being was killed by what I disbelieve [Abbas: 17], so he was upset with his covenant, and you have passed your covenant.And its booster: that his blessing will spend in the path of his illness, so he pledged to you to give you the types of blessings and he did and pledged to him with his ritual What you did for that is not that the human being is to seek to see him asking [Al -Alam: 7, 6].Fifth: Will you be blessed with the types of blessings to be good to the poor: and improve that God loves the good people [the cow: 195] and then you are to the And their briefing: Those who are stingy and commanded people with disgrace [Al -Nasa: 37].وسادِسُها: أعْطاكَ النِّعَمَ العَظِيمَةَ لِتَكُونَ مُقْبِلًا عَلى حَمْدِهِ وأنْتَ تَحْمَدُ غَيْرَهُ فانْظُرْ إلى السُّلْطانِ العَظِيمِ لَوْ أنْعَمَ عَلَيْكَ بِخُلْعَةٍ نَفِيسَةٍ, ثُمَّ إنَّكَ في His presence is exposed to him and remains busy with the service of some of the projection, how do literature and time be required.Glory be to him with the covenant of charity and grapes (P-42) and how we are transferred to the covenant of salvation and servitude, so what we are able to do so is that we are one of the first life to the last of our life to the last of our life A single moment of the types of blessings on our appearance and interior, and every one of those blessings calls me a thank you for the same time We knew its entity and bulls, then it is the pursuit of it on the existence of our forgiveness and our shortcomings increasing in the types of blessings, mercy and generosity, so we are from our age We are removed in the grades of the deficiency, the default, and the investigator of the defamation, and it is its pursuit of no more in charity, kindness, and generosity, and the achievement of praise and praise, for it is the same.It was more After that, after that, the greater of it, and the more it was on us, the more we are, the greatest of it, the greatest and the sorrow of it.His actions on the path of the permanent in terms of it does not lead to the obedience, then he said in this verse: He does not obtain the covenant of the unjust, and this is a hard -to -be of us, and we are the one who says: It is worthy of generosity, forgiveness, mercy, and goodness, and the issuance of us is what is appropriate for us from ignorance, treachery, default, and lazy, so we ask you for you and the best of you The merciful.
