The Quranic researcher is the righteous ruling that is related to the fighting and fight in the path of God who fight you and do not be accustomed to that God does not love the aggressors (P-109).Those who fight you and do not be accustomed to that God does not love the aggressors and in the verse of the questions: the first question: that he is up to the righteousness in the verse in the context of the one who is in the way The Almighty said: The righteousness is that you come to the house from its appearance, but the righteousness is the one who feared and the peas came from its chapters [Al -Baqarah: 189] and command the piety in the way of God The prohibitions and the act of duties, the fee is knowledge, and the piety is a work, and the abuse is only in these two, then when it was commanded in this verse with the most severe of the sections of the righteousness He killed the people of God and said: They fought in the path of God.The second question: in the reason for the descent: The first: The Lord and the son of Zayd said: This is the first verse that came down in the fighting, so when it came down, it was the Messenger of the Lord.He fought, and it is sufficient for those who left it, and he remained in this case until it came down to the Almighty saying: So kill the partners [Repentance: 5].And the second saying: that he - peace and blessings be upon him - came out with his companions to want the Hajj and descended the limitations, and it is a place that is a lot فَأقامَ شَهْرًا لا يَقْدِرُ عَلى ذَلِكَ, ثُمَّ صالَحُوهُ عَلى أنْ يَرْجِعَ ذَلِكَ العامَ ويَعُودَ إلَيْهِمْ في العامِ القابِلِ, ويَتْرُكُونَ لَهُ مَكَّةَ ثَلاثَةَ أيّامٍ حَتّى يَطُوفَ ويَنْحَرَ The guidance and do whatever he wants, so the Messenger of God ﷺ is satisfied with that and their goodness to it, then he returned to the city and prepared in the yearly Sunnah, then he was afraid of the companions And they repel them from the mosque, and to fight them, and they were cursed to their fights in the month of the forbidden and in the sanctuary, so God Almighty sent out these verses, and he said: They needed her, and he said: They fought in the path of God.* * * The word of God is the high, and does not fight the randomness or hearing.The following question: They disagreed with what is meant by saying: Those who fight you on face The payment of the payment is from the pilgrimage, or on the face of the fighting, and this face is an agreement to what we have narrated from Ibn Abbas in the reason for the descent of this verse.And the second: They fought all those who have a capacity and a jurisdiction over the fighting.And the third of it: they fought all those who have a capacity for fighting and a people, as well So he woke up for her [Al -Anfal: 61] and know that the first saying is close to the back because he is the most loud saying: “Those who fight you are required to be their ones, so they are the ones who are doing.The recipient of fighting and qualified to him before his feet on him, because he does not describe his being a fighter except on the path of metaphor.* * * Fifth question: One of the people who said: This is a texture, and that is because this verse indicated that God is upholstered, and it is obligatory to fight the fighting, The fighters, with the same way that he said: They fought in the path of God who fight you and then after: and do not accrue to this destiny, and do not fight those who do not fight you, so you will be rewarded, so that it is the one who has been.Other than those who fight, then he said after that: and kill them where you stopped them [Al-Baqarah: 191] So this is the first to obtain the first (p-110) in the fight of those who did not fight, so that he did not fight, so he did not fight.Hins, and a saying that he says: We receive that this verse is indicative of the matter of the fighting of those who did not fight us, but this judgment has become forgotten.As for his saying: It is a sign of preventing those who did not fight us, so this is not a Muslim, and the words of the Almighty: Do not be accustomed to this The meaning is: and do not start in the sanctuary with the remainder, and from it that the person is intended: and do not be accustomed to the removal of those who have forbidden it from those who are among those who are among you, or from you, or from them However, it is necessary to call a call, or to kill the women, the young, and the sheikh, and on all these estimates, the verse is not forgotten.If it was said: He endowed that we do not copy in the verse, but what is the reason that God Almighty is the first to fight those who fight, and then in the end of the matter, then they are given in their fighting.We said: Because at the beginning of the matter, the Muslims were a few, so the righteousness was the accumulation of companionship, softness, and compliments.After the appearance of the miracles and its consecration of them after a while, the despair obtained from their Islam, so the command of God Almighty did not come to the end of their feet.The sixth question: the disgraceful, they took the Almighty saying: God does not love the aggressors.And his answer was presented, and God knows.
