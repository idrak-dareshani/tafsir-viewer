The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty, and when Moses said to his people that God commands you to slaughter a cow.It shows us what he said that he says that it is a cow that is not obligatory, nor is the deception of an aid between that, so do what you are commanding.The whistle is a slope of its color, the view of the two eyes.It raises the earth and does not water the pill, a Muslim, in which there is no thing in which you said now, you have come to the truth, and they flied to it, and they did not do.You conceal, and we say it, so that it will be done by God.It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas and the prisoner of the interpreters that a man from the sons (P-106) was broken.Peace, and Moses strived to know the killer, and when he did not appear, they said to him: Ask your Lord to show us until he shows him A cow, so they liked that, then they tightened themselves with themselves, after a while, and they were excluded in the request of the description, so when you did not find it, they did not find it When a certain person and did not follow it except with the weakness of the thues, then they bought it, slaughtered it, and commanded them Moses that they take a member of it, so they will be fed up, so they will be killed, so they will be killed, so they will be killed, so they will be killed.Live and called his killer, and he who started with the complaint, and they killed him in the leadership, and then here are the questions: Al -Hasan is in it that it is the Almighty’s money, so there is no symptoms for anyone on it, and when the disgrace is, it is good for the sake of the signs.The second question: It is a matter of sacrificing a cow from the city of the world, and this is the good duty, so that indicated that on the validity of our saying by the duty of the good.The third question: those who say that the general ones agreed that his saying is up to the Almighty: God commands you to slaughter a cow with a cow, so that they will be slaughtered by any The formula is beneficial to this general, and the general denial of the general said: This does not indicate the general public and begged him with his faces: the first: that the concept is from the saying of the one who said.It can be divided into two sections, so it is correct to say: a sacrifice is appointed by a softening from its affairs, Katt, and it is also true that it is said that it is said that it is said.You want, so the understanding of the concept is from your saying, “Slaughtering”, the meaning of a blessed between these two divisions, and the partner between The two divisions are not required by one of them, so if his saying, they slaughtered a cow, and it is not necessary with the meaning of its saying: He does not benefit the general because he had benefited from the general, if he said, they were a cow, that is, a cow you liked, and it was saying: We were broken, and when we did not know this, this said.The second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: they slaughtered a cow, like the ritual of our saying, do not sacrifice a cow, and our saying do not sacrifice a cow that will benefit from the year We said, they slaughtered a cow that raises the general denial and suffices in the integrity of the public of the negation, especially the confirmation of one, so then the saying of it: The matter is the sacrifice of a single cow only, but the launch in the sacrifice of any cow you want, so that there is no need for me to rely on that negation, so it is not obligatory to be.The third: that its saying is up to the Almighty: a cow of uniformity, and the denial individuality is to benefit an appointed individual in itself, other than the one who is in the same way.It is not permissible for him to benefit an individual, that is, an individual that was with the way that if he said: I saw a man, then he is not beneficial except what we mentioned, then if you are in the news that he is in the news, then he is in the news.Likewise, and those who say that the general ones, if it was slaughtered by any cow, was that it is removed from the truce, so it is necessary to benefit the general.The answer is that this is a source of first requirement, because this is proven, even if it is proven that his saying is: Slaughtering a cow with a slander, and it is a slander of any The recipient is in it.This is the words in this question.If you know this, then say: People disagree that his saying is up to the Almighty: they slaughtered a cow, is it a matter of sacrificing a sophisticated cow, or is it a matter that is a matter It was, for those who permitted the delay of the Bayan from the time of the speech, they said: It was an order to sacrifice a certain cow, but it was not clear, and he said: By slaughtering any cow (P-107), it was only that the people were asked when they changed the cost at that time, and that is because the first cost was sufficient, and it was enough The cows, then, is the righteousness, so when they disobeyed and did not exceed and returned with the question, it was not forbidden to change the salt, and that is known in the witness; Because the mastermind of his son may command him with the ease as a choice, then if the child is forbidden from him, he may see the reconciliation in his command of his hearts.And the first parting of the journey of his faces: The first: His Exalted saying: Call your Lord to show us what is what she is and what she has and the saying of God is the Almighty: He says that he says that it is a good.Safarra, it is a cow, not a humiliation that enriches the earth, leaving what they commanded By sacrificing it before, and this is the way it indicates that the mourning of it was not the sacrifice of a cow, that is, a cow, it was, but the mourning of it was a slander.The second: The attributes mentioned in the answer to the second question are either said: they are the attributes of the cows that they were commanded to sacrifice first or the attributes of a cow of the cow of the question.And what was required of them before that, and the first is the one who is required, and the second requires that the sufficiency be fell in the lines of the removed last, and that it is not necessary The remembrance was before that, and when the Muslims were collected, those attributes with their families were considered an adept for our knowledge of the corruption of this division.If it was said, as for the creatures, we do not hand them over to the cow, so it is not permissible to say: It is the creatures of the story and the affairs, and this is a way to the one?We said: This is invalid for its faces: one of them: that these creatures, if they were, are bound to the story and the time, the remainder of what is after these creatures other than the beneficial; Because there is no extensive in his saying: a cow of whistling, but it is necessary to add anything else, and that is the disagreement of the origin, but if we make the creatures domesticated to the commandment, this is not the same Warning.And the second: that the ruling is the righteousness of the kinna to the story and the disagreement of the original; Because the kiniyah must return it to something that is remembered, and the story and the affairs did not leave their remembrance, so it is not permissible for the kinship to them, but we are the same In some of the positions, then he remained in the first place.And the third of it: that the destiny is in his saying: What is its color and what is not doubt that he is a leader to the cow that is commanded by it, so it is obligatory to be in the saying of it: That cow, otherwise the answer is not a question.The third: that if they were as immortal, they were not in the place of what he commanded in Moses, which removes the imbalance because the fate of what Moses mentioned is that it is a cow.Full -year -old in the year, and this destiny is subject to many numbers.And the second jurisprudence was carried out by his faces: one of them: that his saying is up to the Almighty: God commands you to sacrifice a cow with it, which is commanded that you will be sacrificed.It requires the general, and that requires that the adjective after that is a new cost.And the second: If the intention was to slaughter a certain cow, then they would not be entitled to seek to seek the request of the Bayan, but they would be fulfilled by the praise of it, so what is the one who said: So do what you command, and in its saying: So they slaughtered it and what they almost did our knowledge of their shortness of what they were commanded by what they were commanded first Sluped a certain cow.The third: what It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said: If they slaughtered any cow, they wanted, I would have been rewarded, but they tightened themselves on themselves, and he tightened them.The time in which they were commanded to sacrifice the cow, they were needed to slaughter it.For the time for the time of the pilgrim, it is not permissible.And the answer: On the first thing, what is clear of us in the first question is that his saying: God commands you to slaughter a cow that does not indicate that the mourning is with him.The second: that his saying is up to the Almighty: and they did not do in it there is no significance that they were overlooked at the beginning For each one of them, then we carry it on the other, which is that when they stopped the Bayan, they stopped at that Abbasement from the chapter of one and with the ability of health, so do not reconcile that you are opposed to the book of God Almighty, and on the authority of the four: that you are the last of the time for the time of the pilgrim, but the time for the time On the Fair and that is a variety of us.And know that if we are raised on the saying that the mourning of it is a cow, that is, a cow, it is, then it is necessary to say: the clogged is a chain of transmission, so they will be in the first place You are neither exhausted nor with an appointment, but when they did not do so, they would have been a whistling, and when they did not do so, they would not be done to be the same Water the plow.Then those who say this golden, some of them said in the expression of the later, the last one must be fulfilled for every adjective that is presented until the cow is presented until the grace of the liquid The last is not obligatory, nor is it a good and the whistle, and for those who say: It is obligatory to be the last one.The first was more likened to the narratives and the method of tension on them when the compliance is repeated, and if it is proven that the Bayan is not delayed, then it is necessary to be a little Advance, and that indicates that the easiest may be copied with the hardships and indicates the permissibility of copies before the verb, but it does not indicate the permissibility of the woven.On the copy of the copying on the law of peace be upon him, and he also has a question that the misfortune on the copy is a copy or not, and it is indicated by the second Whoever disobeys and did not do what was assigned at first.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: They said: Do you take a shake, and it has anxes: the first question: read: “shake” by the guarantee and shake of the skeleton of the coffin Hafs read: (shake) with the two guarantees and wow, as well as enough.The second question: Al -Qafal said his saying: They said, "We take us as a question in the sense of denial and mock.That is, in his knowledge, and God is our hope, that is, our paths and his counterparts, his saying is up to the Almighty: So you took them ridiculously [the believers: 110] The owner of the “scout” said: We make a place of mockery or the people of a mock or mocking us, and the sorrow itself is the excess of the mockery.The third question: The people only said that, because when they were asked of Moses, peace be upon him, to help the killer, and Moses said: They slaughtered a cow, and they did not know this The question is suitable, so they thought that peace be upon him is tired; Because it is a necessity that Moses, peace be upon him, commanded them to sacrifice the cow and what he taught them that if they slaughtered the cow, they will be killed by one of it, so then it is not.The slope of the mock, and it is enticed that peace be upon him, and if they have indicated how the case is the case The cow thinks that that runs the jewelry of the mockery.(P-109) We took a mockery because if they said that and complained about the ability of God, the Almighty is the neighborhood of the dead, then it is disbelief, and if they complained that the one who commanded them is the best of the peace of God, the peace be upon him.They have passed the betrayal on Moses, peace be upon him, in the revelation, and that is also disbelief.Among the people who said: It is not obligatory for disbelief and his two sides: The first: that the players on the prophets are brought up, so perhaps they thought that it is upon him, peace be upon him.It is not obligatory.The second: that the meaning of its words is up to the Almighty: We take us to shake, that is, what happened to this answer, as if you are mocking us, not that they achieved the mosaic.As for his words, he said: I seek refuge in God to be from the ignorant, in his face and faces: one of them: that the preoccupation with the mockery is only the cause The feet on the mockery, and the peace be upon him was not hidden from the soul of the thing that they attributed to him, but he sought refuge from the Lord of the Lord When such: I seek refuge in God from the mind of the mind and the dominance of passion, and the one who has the name of the name of the cause is made.This is the strongest direction.And secondly: I seek refuge in God to be among the ignorant people with the mockery in the matter of religion from the severe punishment and the great bastard, for when I knew that I have known.And the third of it: some of them said: The soul of the mockery may be called ignorant and ignorant, and it was narrated from some of the people of the language: The ignorance is against the dream, as some of them said that it is against the science.He knew that this saying is from Moses, peace be upon him, indicates that the mockery is from the bones of the great and the saying that the saying in it in it in the saying of the Almighty said: They are mocked [the cow: 14], God is mocking them [Al -Qar: 15] and know that the people were asked, peace be upon him, for the two things of three things: God has not said that they are: They said, “Call your Lord to us, show us what is, so Moses, peace be upon him, answered with his saying: He says that it is a cow, there is no one who is so and not.” What do you command and know that in the verse there is research: The first: If we say: His saying is up to the Almighty: God commands you to sacrifice a cow that indicates the matter of the matter However, it is not clear that the signed of their question; Because the one who is taught to it, when it was beautiful, the goodness and the media.As for the saying of those who say: It is in the origin of the language for the general, then it is imperative that it is what he carried on this way?And in it is a face: one of them: that Moses, peace be upon him, when he told them that if they slaughtered the cow and crushed the dead with each other, they became alive, so they liked that The cow that will be like this special is only a specific cow, so they do not get in question about the question about it and described it as a disobedience from the sake With these properties, the people were wrong in that; Because this strange verse was not the characteristic of the cow, but it was a miracle that God Almighty shows on the hand of peace be upon him.And the second: Perhaps the people wanted a cow, that is, a cow, but the killer was afraid of the light, so the suspicion was thrown in the clarification, and the mourning said: The cow, when the time for it was time, they returned to that to Moses.And the third of it: that the first speech, even if the general benefit, except that the people wanted the overwhelms in it, so they asked a request for the increase of the Bayan and the removal of the captives of the rituals, except that It changed and it was necessary to sacrifice the appointed cow.Because “what” is a question, and it is “a sign of the truth, so what is not necessary and it is a request for the truth and the definition of what is good and the right Her adjectives that are outside her essence, and it is known that the age of the age of things outside of what is required is, so this answer is not a custody of this question.The answer to it: that the matter, even if it is as you mentioned, but the state of the situation indicates that it was what they have said of their saying: What is the cows He asked for what he was and the explanation of his truth, but they were intended to seek the attributes that are characterized by some of the cows from one; If this is good, the remembrance of the outstanding attributes of this question.The third research: The owner of the “scouts” said: The synagogue: the Sunnah was called, and it is obligatory because she was imposed by her year, meaning that she cut off her and the last of her, and the last one, The half.The judge said: As for the baking, it was said: It is the young and it was said: It was not born, and it was said: It is the one who was once and once, the preference said that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was It is the Sunnah and in the biking that it is the young and it is one of the women who were not inhabited and from the camels that were placed one stomach.Al -Qaflal said: The deception is indicated by the first and the baccalaure of the first of the fruit and from it the evil of the day and it is said: I was raised on them, if it came in the first one, and it is the first It was not born because the known is from the name of the female from the female in the children of Adam, what the solution did not have, and some of them said: The helpers that were folded after.A warfare: If you are a war, then it was done once after once, and a need for an aid: if you were spent once after once.The loyal research: the scholars have transcended the words of the Almighty: an aid between that on the permissibility of the guidance and the severity of the majority of the suspicion in the rulings, as it is not known that it is from the one who knows it The guidance, and we are two questions: The first: The memorization of “between” it requires two things as a matter of ascending, so whoever is permissible to enter it?.The answer: Because it is in the sense of two things, where it was signed, referring to it to what was mentioned from the extent and the evil.The second question: How is it permissible to refer to a word: “that” to those who are feminine with the fact that it is a sign of one remembrance?.The answer: It is permissible to mention that on the interpretation of what was mentioned or what was presented to the prosecution in the words.As for his words, the Almighty: So do what you are commanding, and in it, two: The first: so do what you are commanding from your saying: Your good command.The second: that the intended is, so do your command in the sense of your command, as a name for the one who is active with the source, as the ritual of the prince.He knew that the original intended from this answer is the cow in the most beautiful, and that is because the young is deficient because it is after what it has reached, as if it has come to the condition of the condition.It became an incomplete and it was overlooked by the limit of the fullness.Then, he said: He told their second question, which is the saying of the Almighty: They said, "Call your Lord to us, show us what he has given to us, and he knew that when they know the state of the Sunnah, they will be in.And God Almighty answered them: it is a yellowishness, and it is a collar, and the fog of the thoracted and the whistling of the whistling, and it is said.Green and green, and here Qalan: The first question:.The answer: It was not a news about the color, but it was certain of the whistles, except that the color of it was highlighted by the act of the actor and the color of it, and it is not.Your saying: Safarra is a fracture and a whistle, and its colors..Answer: It is good in it, because the color is a name for the body, which is the yellow, as if it was said that the whistling is a whistle, so it is from your saying: And on the authority of Wahb: If you look at it, it is imagined to you that the sun of the sun comes out from its skin.
