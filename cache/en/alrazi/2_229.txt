The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: the divorce is two times, so it is a well -being or a secret with charity.Know that this is the third judgment of the rulings of divorce, and it is the divorce in which the return is proven.In the verse: The first question: The man in the ignorance was divorced and then he will be brought back before her enemies, and if he had divorced her, he would have come to her time.The bull is a constant for him, “So a woman came to Aisha, may God be pleased with her, and she complained that her husband is divorced and brought back to her, so he will be happy with her That is for the Messenger of God ﷺ, and the Almighty saying: The divorce is two times.The second question: the interpreters are different in that this speech is a beginner judgment, or it is attached It must be a divorce after a division on the separation without gathering and the question (P-83) one payment, and this interpretation is the saying of the one who said: And the forbidden, and the claim of Abu Zayd al -Dabousi in the secrets: that this is the saying of Omar, Uthaman, Ali, and Abd Allah ibn Mas'oud, and Abdullah ibn Ubah Amran ibn al -Husayn, Abu Musa al -Ash'ari, and Abu al -Daradah and Hudhafah.And the first saying in the interpretation of the verse is that this is not a word, but rather it is attached to what is before it, and the meaning is that the time of the time is two times, and there is no time, and there is no return The saying of the collection between the three, and it is the ghost of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him.The argument of those who say the first saying: that the memorization of the divorce is to benefit the exploitation; Because the thousand and the blame, if we were not for the martyrs, did not benefit the people, then the estimation of the verse became: all the divorce is two times, and the third time, and if he said that he said, so that he said this Difference; Because the times are only after separation.If it was said: This verse is returned to the elderly divorce, and when the collection is permissible, not an elderly.We said: It is not in the verse that the year of the Sunnah is not the same as the interpretation Two times, meaning two bids, but the enemy was from the memorization of the matter to the words of the news because of what we mentioned as it was presented that the expression of the word is the one The meaning of the matter, so it was proven that this verse is indicative of the matter with the separation of divorce, and on the tension in that matter and the exaggeration in it, then those who say that they say to this Two sayings: The first: It is the choice of many of the scholars of religion, that if it was divorced by two or three, only the one is located, and this saying is the measure; Because the prohibition indicates the detention of the one who is a good spoil, and the saying With a pursuit of the entry of that spoiling in the existence, and that it is not permissible, so he must judge the vastness of the fall.And the second saying: It is the saying of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him: that if he is forbidden, he is located, and this is from him based on that the prohibition does not indicate corruption.The third saying in the interpretation of this verse is to say: It is not a beginner words, but it is attached to what before it; This is because it is exalted in the first verse that the right of the bull is steadfast for the husband, and it was not mentioned that that right is permanently fixed or to an appointed end, so it was like that The partner to the indicated, or like the one who is extracted to the characteristic, so he explained in this verse that that divorce in which the husband has proven the right of the right to the right of the return, it is the right of the time Just, and after the two divisions, the bit does not prove the right of the return with the thousand and the blame in its saying: the divorce of the righteous, the precedent, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: We have been in it with the confirmation of the return is that there is two times, so this is an interpretation of good and metaphor for the purpose of the verse.And that indicates that this interpretation is the first one: the first: that his saying: and their dependence is more right to their cold [the cow: 228], if it is for all the conditions, then it is the same.If it is not a year, it is beautiful; Because it is not in it the condition of the condition that has the right to the return, so it will be divided into the Bayan, so if we make the second verse, it is the second one.Coordinated with the special year, or if the Bayan had a total number, and that is more than that it is not like that; Because the delay of the Bayan is about the time of the speech, even if it is permissible, but it is more likely that it is not delayed.(P-84) It requires the restriction of all divorce in the two times, and it is invalid with consensus.Two times and bitter; Because we say: It is his saying: or is a relaxing with goodness attached to his saying: I hold a well -being, not by saying: the divorce is two times, and there is no time, and there is no time, and for the sake of the time, and for the sake of the time Poor in it by divorce, and because we had made the resting the third divorce, if it was saying: if it divorced it, it is a strong divorce, and it is unjust.The third pilgrimage: What was narrated in the reason for the descent of this verse: that it was descended by a woman who doubted Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that he will be pleased with her.By the reason, they have gathered together that the revelation of the verse is not permissible to be outside the general verse, so it was downloading this verse on this meaning on this The last of my foreigners about him.* * * As for his words, he said: I hold a well -being or a secret with goodness, so he has questions: The first question: Constipation is the difference of divorce, and the holding and the silence is a safe from it, it is said: It is a holder and a holder: if it is a horse, the deceased said: It is said: It is said: It is said: It is said: It is said: It is said: And it has a steadfastness from a barrier, that is, a power.As for the relaxation, it is the transmission, and the harshness of the hair will make you happy with one another, and the walker is laid down: if it sends it, it is tired.The second question: the estimation of the verse: that divorce, in which we judged the confirmation of the return to the husband, is that there is two times, then the duty is that you are the one who is the duty.With a well -being or a secret with goodness, and the meaning of the constipation with the well -being is that it is brought back, not by the intent of the muddle, but rather the intention of the rituals and effects.In the sense of the verse and Jahan: one of them: that the third divorce is signed, and it was narrated, “It is when the Almighty said: The divorce is two times.It is his saying: or a secret with goodness.And know that this direction is the closest to the faces: one of them: that the fulfillment is in its saying: if its divorce is required, it requires the occurrence of divorce, delayed from that of the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the rest With the secret is the third divorce, it was his saying: If it divorced it with a powerful divorce, and it is not permissible.And secondly: If we had the rest of the boundaries, the verse was transmitted to all the conditions; Because after the second divorce, either it is returned, and it is intended by saying it: he holds a well -being or does not return it, but rather leaving it until it is left until it is so Between, which is what is meant by saying: or is a secret with charity or its divorce, and it is what is meant by saying: If it divorced it, then the verse was a disgrace to all of the parts.The rest of the charity is another divorce, it is necessary to leave one of the three sections, and it is necessary to repeat in the remembrance of the divorce, and it is not permissible.And the third of it: that the appearance of the resting is the luxury and the talisman, so the loyalty is carried on the leaving of the bull.And he pushed it: He said after the remembrance of the rest: It is not permissible for you to take from what you have come to something and what is meant by the immorality, and it is known that it is not true The third, for this is a phenomenon if it is not proven that the news that we narrated in the validity of that is the saying, then that is true of that news, then there is no more.What is meant by charity is that if he left it, it will lead to it, its financial rights, and it is not reminded of it after the separation with misfortune and the people will not be repeated.* * * The third question: the ruling on proving the right of the return that the human being as long as it is with his owner, he does not know that he is hard for him to be separated from him or not That appears, and if God made the single divorce It is forbidden to return to the greatest of hardship for the human being that love appears after the separation, then when it was like the angels, not the one who is the one who does not The crime of the right to the right to the right after the separation was two times, and when the human being raised himself in that separation, and he knew the state The righteousness of its hold is its reaction and holding it with the well -being, and if the righteousness is for him, it will rest her.And his head with his servant.* * His Excellency said: It is not permissible for you to take from what you have come to anything except that they are afraid that the limits of God will not be able Those of God have redeemed with him, so do not accommodate it, and whoever is the limits of God, then those who are unjust.He knows that this is the ruling that is the ruling of the rulings of divorce, and it is the evangelization If he divorced her, he will not take anything from her from the one who gave her from the skill, clothes, and a walk that is preferred by her; And that is because he owned its place, and he enjoyed it in the interview of what he gave it, so it is not permissible to take anything from it, and he will enter into this prohibition that he will be shed.In Surah Al -Nasa: Do not lead them to go to some of what you have come [Nasa: 19].And his saying here: except that they are afraid that the limits of God will not be as a saying of there: except that he comes with a clear obscenity [Al -Nasi: 19], so he proves that the one who has come to the one who is the one.It is with the harm and misfortune of creation, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: Do not come out of their homes and do not come out unless he comes with an obscenity that is clear: [1] The obscenity indicated the harm to its firmness, and he also said: Do not take anything from it from it, you will take it with two vicinity and a clear sin [the women: 20], so it is the same.If it was said: Whoever speaks in his saying: It is not permissible for you to take, if the elders have no goodness, it is not the saying: If you are not afraid, if you are not afraid, if you are not afraid, if you are not afraid, if you do not fear For the imams and the rulers, they do not take anything from them.We said: The two things are permissible, so it is permissible for the first verse a speech to the elders and the last of which is a speech for the imams and the rulers, and that is not strange in the Qur’an.The whole speech of the imams and the rulers; Because they are those who command to take (P-86) and come to them to them, as if they are the ones who take and the supplies.As for his words, the Almighty: except that they are afraid that the limits of God will not know that he is up to the man who prevented a man to take from his wife when he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the same It is the question of immorality.* * * And in the verse: the first question: narrated, “This verse was descended in the beauty of the daughter of Abdullah ibn Abi, and in its husband, the son of the son The most hated him, and he loved her with the most severe love, so the Messenger of God came ﷺ and said: He separated me from me and between him, so I hate him, and I have been shrouded He comes in the righteousness, and he was short, and they were pursued, and the most darkened, and I am the disbelief after Islam.I gave it.That is the first immortality in Islam.” And in the Sunnah of Abi Dawood that the woman was the year of the Sahl al -Ansariya.* * * The Mujahidin said: It is permissible to be disturbed in the case of fear and anger.Throwing, without this case, the immorality is a pardon, and their pilgrimage is that this verse is frank in that it is not permissible for the husband to take from the woman when it is for me, then it is a woman, then it is a woman, then it is a woman, then it is a matter A special condition, and he said: Except that they are not afraid of the limits of God, so the verse was clear in that it is not permissible to take in the case of the fear of the fear, and the one who is glorified is the one who said: It is permissible in the case of fear and in the case of the state of fear, and the evidence is upon him, the words of the Almighty: if we have something for you from something from it, then eat it, so that it is a good man.[4] Its skill is given without having something for itself in the way of what was humiliated, that was in the immorality that is evaluated due to the owner of its own, for its soul, and the same, and the same, and the same, and the same On the authority of the righteous, as it was in the words of the Almighty: and a believer would not have been killed by a believer except for a mistake [the women: 92], that is, if he was a sinner, then he was a sinner [Narrated: 92].The third question: fearful fear in this verse, which can be carried on the known fear, which is the agreement of what he hates and falls on, This is because fear is a specially desirable state, and because of its obtaining it, he thought that he will talk to him in the future, and the release of the name of the one Mashhaour, so there is no crime, I will be released on this name, the name of fear, and this is a metaphor of famous.I have been afraid of that, in the sense of his thought and his delusion, and the deception was sought: ؎ If you come, then burn me to the side of the generosity I narrate my greatness after my death, it is not buried in the prayer, so I am afraid if it is dead that I will not taste it, then the one who confirms this interpretation is the saying of it The verse: If it divorced it, then it is not a ward to them, if we think that we will be the limits of God.* * * (P-87) The following question: Know that the appearance of this verse indicates that the condition is the fatwa of fear for the man and for women, and there is no one from us We say: The sections can be in this section of four; Because it is either that this fear is from the woman only, or by the husband only, or the fear does not get from one of them, or from one of them, or from them, or from them, or from them.They kissed them with.As for the first section: that this fear is from the woman, and that is that the woman be a hateful, hated for the husband, so we will come to the money; The evidence is upon him, what we have narrated from the hadith of a beautiful hadith; Because it appeared the hatred, so the Messenger of God ﷺ has passed away and the reward for taking.If it was said: The high condition of this verse has lost their fear with them, so how you said: It is sufficient to obtain fear from them only.We said: This fear is due to the first of the woman, but he may arrange the fear that has been taken by the husband; Because the woman is afraid of its soul from the disobedience of God in the matter of husband, and he is afraid that if she does not obey him, then he will strike her and distract her, and he may have increased the authority of the duty They have a whole, so that is the reason for it for an affairs that are attached to the husband, and it is permissible for the woman to be accompanied by that of the husband, for the poverty of it, For a disease that is repeated from it, and on this estimation the woman will be disappointed by the disobedience of God in not obeying the husband, and the husband is disagreement from the disobedience Shortly in some of its rights.The second division: that fear is by the husband only, by stripping it and hurting it until it is committed to the ransom, so this money is forbidden, the first of this, the first of this And by the evidence of the birds of the verses, as his saying: Do not lead them to go to go [the women: 19] to his saying: Do you take it with two vices and a ritual insect [Al -Nasiyah: 20] The prohibition of taking that money.The third division: that this fear is not made by the husband, nor by the wife, and we have mentioned that the saying of the most dreamers: that this is the one who is the one.The one who is permissible, and a people said: It is forbidden.The loyal division: that the fear will take place before them with them, so this money is also forbidden; Because the verses that we recite indicate the prohibition of taking that money if the cause is made by the husband, and there is no distortion in the rest of the And because God Excellency a condole for this section is another verse, and it is the saying of the Almighty: If you fear the hardships between them [Al -Nasa: 35] the verse, and he did not remember in it the highest solution.The fourth, and know that this who said from these sections is that it is between the costs and between God Almighty, but in the phenomenon, it is permissible, this is the saying of the jurisprudence.The fifth question: Reading Hamza: The disgrace, as your saying: is a frightening of the increase that the residence of God is left, and this meaning is confirmed by the rule of the servant of God: He says: Fear, so make fear for others.The view of the public added to them is what indicated that the woman fears the temptation on its own, and the husband is afraid that if she does not obey him * * * The sixth question: they disagreed with the amount of what is permissible to fall into it.Ali ibn Abi Taleb, may God be pleased with him, said, Saeed bin Al -Musayyib said: Rather, without what he gave until he is the best of him, and as for the sake of the jurisprudence With the maid, the least, and the equal, and the first was embarrassed by the Qur’an, the news, and the measurement, but the Qur’an said it to the Almighty: It is not permissible for you to take from what he said, That: So there is no wing on them, as it was redeemed with it, so it is necessary to be this back to what it came, and if it was like that, he did not enter into the pornography of God, except for what he has come to the authority of God We narrated that he was steadfast when he asked for a beautiful way to return his numbers, so he said beautiful: and his increase.He said: "No, his neck only." And if the immortality was permissible, it was permissible for the prophet to prevent it from it, and the measure is that it is the permissibility With the adversity of the woman and attached to the harm to it, and it is not permissible, and as for the jurisprudence of jurisprudence, they said: The immortality is a belief, so it is obligatory to not be met.The woman may not be satisfied with marriage except with the many friends, so so the husband is not satisfied with the abuse except with the many ways, not the same With the husband, where his hatred and his hatred appeared, and this is confirmed by what it was narrated that Omar, may God be pleased with him Baybli is two nights, then he said to her: How are you?She said: I did not repent from these two nights.Omar said: He gave it to her, even if it was a relative.And what is meant is to make it up until its clusters.And on the authority of Ibn Omar It was a woman who had been brought up from her husband with everything and with every garment on her, except for her, and he was not denied.* * * The loyal question: the immorality is a clear divorce, and it is a saying to me, Uthaman, Ibn Mas'oud, Al -Hassan, Al -Sha’abi, Al -Nakha’i, Ata, and Ibn Al -Masib And Makhoul and Al -Zahri, who is the saying of Abu Hanifa and Safyan, and he is one of the words of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with them, and Ibn Abbas, and Akarmah said: For a contract, which is the second saying of the Shafi’i, and with it, Ahmad, Ishaq, and Abu Thar said.The Hajj of the one who said: It is divorce, that the nation is collected on the fact that it is dirty or divorce, so if it is prolonged as it is, then it is a divorce, but it is a divorce, but it is not.Because if it was dirty, he would not have been correct in the skillful skillful, as the distance in the sale, and also if the immorality was dirty, then if it did not, it does not mention it, and it is not the same.The skill is like the abode, because the thickness must return it, even if it is not mentioned, and when it was not, it was also proven that the immorality is not with dirt, and if it is a length.The pilgrimage of those who said: It is not a divorce of the faces: the first pilgrimage: that he is upset, he said: If you are afraid that the limits of God will not be found, then there is no ward to it, then it is for them, then it is for them, then it is for it, then it is for it.If you divorced her, do not be permissible for him after you marry a husband other than him.The Sunnah is about Ibn Abbas.The second pilgrimage: that the Prophet ﷺ authorized Bin Qais Bin Shamas in the immortality of his wife, with the fact that the divorce is in the time of menstruation or in the purity Empty is a divorce that was obligatory for the Prophet ﷺ to reveal the situation in that, and when he did not reveal, but rather he was divided by divorce, it is not necessary.The third pilgrimage: Abu Dawid narrated in his Sunnah on the authority of Akrama, “On the authority of Ibn Abbas, that a woman who was steadfast bin Qais, when she was dispersed (p-89) Hida.Because God Almighty said: And the divorced women are lining with themselves three readers, and if this was divorced, he would not be able to do it on one reader.As for the saying of the Almighty: that is the limits of God, the meaning is that what is presented is the remembrance of the rulings of divorce, the return and the immortality, so do not assume it, that is: do not get it away from it.The sure one follows him on the feet, and he said: Whoever is considered the limits of God, then those who are unjust and in it are guys: one of them is that he is the one who is a remembrance The unjust [Hood: 18] So the injustice was mentioned here, alerting it to the curse.And the second: that the unjust is the name of defamation and contempt, so this The name is a running runway.And the third of it: that he released the memorial of the darkness, which he alerted him to the injustice of the human being on his soul, where he is presented to the disobedience, and there is also no injustice that is not.The woman is her enemy, or she has met something of what was created in her mercy, or a man left the holding of the well -being and the relaxation of goodness, or he was taken from a sentence of nothing The woman is the woman, in all these positions, it will be unjust to others, so if I release the oppressor, he will be given to his unjust, for his unjust, for his unjust.And in it the greatest threats.
