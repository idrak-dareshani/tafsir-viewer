The Quranic researcher is the fourth of the death, and those who die of you and the rituals of the trustees of their faces are lost to their faces.So they did in themselves from a well-known, and God is a dear wise (P-1334).A delay, for if they were released, then there is no wise for you in what they did in themselves from a well -known, and God is dear, wise, in which there are questions: Because of the authority (a trustee) by raising, and those who remain in the interest, as for raising, he has sayings: The first: that his saying: (a trustee) is a beginner, and he said: And the good deeds of the denial, because it is specialized in the causes of the subject, as well as its saying: peace be upon you, and good for you.And the second: that his saying is: (a will to face them) begins, and it is added to him a news, and the ability to do them is a guardian of their faces, and his will: What you imposed [Al -Baqarah: 237], a Muslim woman [Women: 92], fasting three days [Al -Ma’idah: 89].The third: the estimation of the verse: the command is a commandment, the suppositories, or the judgment is a will, and on this direction, our beginner.And the four: the estimation of the verse: your will is written on you.And the fifth: its estimation: to be a will from you.And the sixth: the estimation of the verse: the commandment of those who died from you is a guardian of the state, and all of these faces are good and good, and the reader of the righteous: The estimation of the verse: let them be a guardian.And the second: its estimation: you are commanded a will, as your saying: you are the path of the Paradise; That is, the path of the path of the pious.The third: its estimation: the obligation of those who died a will.As for the saying of the Exalted: (Mutawaa), it is in its faces: the first: that it be in the sense: they have enjoyed them, so the estimation will be: let them not command them Mutawa.The second: to be appreciation: God made them a pleasure; Because what is before the words is indicated by this.The third: it is erected in the case.As for his saying: (It is not a breakthrough), then he said: The first: that he poured into his fell by the case, as if he said: they used to be a matter.The second: He erected the rejectionist of the rejectionist.The second question: In this verse, three sayings: The first: It is the choice of the vocabulary of the two interpreters, that it is a human being.His wife is something of his inheritance except the one who is a year The husband, and if she wants to come out before the around, but when it came out, it will be done, this is a sentence of what is in this verse; Because if we read (A will) by raising, the meaning was: they have a will, and if we read it with the instance, the meaning was: let them be a guardian, and on the two readers, this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, The commandment has become evident with two things: one of them: the enjoyment and the annexation to the one.And the second: the rak'ah to the day, then the Almighty revealed that if they were exited, then there is no wing to you in that, so you have proven that this verse requires two things: one of them: one of them: one of them: The money of the husband is a year.The second: The obligatory prayer is a year, because the rak'ah and the expense are required of the money of the dead for a year that must be forbidden from the husband with another husband in this year.These are the two rulers, as for the will of the height and the sequence; Because the Qur’an indicated the confirmation of the inheritance for it, and the Sunnah indicated that there is no trustee for a heir, so the group of the Qur’an and Sunnah became the people of the people of Louvak And the silence is in the day, and as for the one who is in the past, it is a texture with its saying: they are raised with themselves four months and twenty: [234] The most advanced and the most late are among those who are among those who are.(P-135) The second saying: It is the saying of Mujahid: that God Almighty has revealed in the number of the dead from it, its husbands are two things: one of them: what is presented while he is the one who said: With themselves four months and ten.And the last: This is the verse, so it is necessary to download these two verses in two states.So we say: If she did not choose the knife in the house of her husband and did not take the spending from the money of her husband, she was four months and ten years old As for the choice of the knife in the house of its husband, and the taking of its money and its blessing, then I prepare it is the one who is around, and the two verses are removed from these two people, the two of the two Who are working with them.The third saying: It is the saying of my father, the Muslim Al -Asifahi: that the meaning of the verse: whoever dies from you and sheds married, and has been a commandment for the face of their faces.The day is that if they were released before that, and the guardian of the husband, after that the period that God has struck, is the highest Known; That is: a correct marriage; Because their residency with this will is not necessary, he said: The reason is that they were in the time of the ignorance, they were recommended to be tied and the silence is complete, and it was a complete one, and it was the one who is more In the way, then God has shown in this verse that this is not obligatory, and on this estimation, the transcription is false, and it is taken over his saying: So the destiny has to its numbers with the amount of place.The second: that the transcriber is delayed from the woven in the descent, and if it was delayed from it in the descent, the best was to be delayed from it in The recitation is also, because this synthesis is better, but the transcription is presented to the textile in the recitation, so if it is permissible in the sentence, except that it is considered to be from the bad God is up to Him, and it is necessary to be able to be able to do so, and when this verse was delayed from that recitation, it was the first that it was not judged by its formation.The third direction: It is that it has been established in the knowledge of the origins of jurisprudence that when the opposition was made between the copies and between the specialization, the specialization was the first, and it is the first, and it is the first, and it is the first, and it is the first, and it is the first, In the two states of what is the saying of the transcription, then the destiny was to the words of Mujahid, a first of the obligation of copying from the same indication, and as for the saying of Abu Because you say: the estimation of the verse: they have a trustee for their faces, or its estimation: let them be a guardian, for you will add this He says: Rather, the estimation of the verse is: and those who die from you and have a will to their faces, or its estimation: they may have a trustee to the face of this The husband, and if it is inevitable, is not the first of your destruction, then it is possible that the guarantee is what you mentioned, the necessity of the rituals of the copy A peaceful mind that the involvement of my father is a Muslim who is more than you, and that the commitment of this copy is a commitment to him, without a sign, with what is said to this copy The words of God are the Almighty, and this is a clear words.And if you know this, then we say: This is the verse from the first to the end of it, it is a single conditional sentence, so the condition is its saying: and those who die from you Because of their faces, they are not going to go to the minds, so this is all a condition, and the penalty is his saying: If you come out, then there is no wing to you in what is done in what you do in this The statement of the saying of my father is a Muslim, and he is in the end of health.* * * The third question: the one who is used to the difference of the death is not an agreed for it or a loser, a pregnant woman, or it is a perpetrator, and it was narrated on the authority of Ali, peace be upon him, peace be upon him and the authority of peace That the one has the right to be pregnant, and on the authority of Jabir and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them (P-136) that they said: There is no agreement for it, according to the inheritance, and what is the right of the sake of the sake of the inheritance.One of them: Do not deserve the knife while he is a saying of peace be upon him and Ibn Abbas and Aisha, and the Abu Hanifa and the sisters of Al -Mazeni went.The second: I deserve it, and it is the saying of Omar, Uthaman, Ibn Masoud, and the mother of peace, may God be pleased with them, and with him, he said your money, Al -Tuari and Ahmad, and the son of the saying Malik, the sister of Abu Saeed Al -Khudayri, was killed by her husband.Peace be upon him: Yes.So I disappeared even if I was in the mosque or in the stone.The appetite, then he answered, became the first to be woven, and it was said: He commanded her to stay in her house with an order on the path of the fools, not on the path of the obligatory He knocked on her, and he said: We gathered us that there is no agreement for it, because the king was cut off with death, so the silence, with the way that they have gone on to the one who did not, And a man on a man who died, and their succession was cut off.The three divorces deserve the knife in every case, and the ties do not fulfill itself at the Mazen, and because the agreement is obligatory in the metaphor of the one Here, and the knife was obligated to count the women, and it is a supply, so we are separated.They say about this question, and that is because this verse is obligatory and the silence, but the junction of the height has become a man who has become a man Or not?He commanded the commandment, so how the dead recommends?That this will may be added to God Almighty in the sense of his command and his mandate, as if it was said: a will from God for their faces, as well Your children [Women: 11] Rather, this meaning improves the readings of those who read the lift.He himself from adornment, and from the feet of marriage, and in lifting the wings and Jahan: one of them: there is no wing in the conflict of the horizon from them if they come out.The second: There is no wing on you in leaving their prevented from the erasure, because its shrine is around the house of its husband, not a duty of it.
