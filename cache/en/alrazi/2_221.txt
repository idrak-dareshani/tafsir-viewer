The Quranic researcher is the sixth judgment while it is related to the marriage (P-47) and do not marry the companies until it believes in and a nation that is good for you, and if you are not like you Until they believe, and a believer slave is better than a partner, and if you like you, those who call for fire, and God calls for paradise and forgiveness for the sake They remember his words of transgression: Do not marry the companies until it believes and a believer nation is better than a partner, and if you like you and do not marry the people, and they will not be blessed, and they will not be married to those who are.A believer is better than a partner, and if you like you, those who call for fire, and God calls for paradise and forgiveness with his permission and shows his verses to the people.That this verse is the counterpart of its saying: and do not hold on to the disobedience of the curtains [the conquered: 10] and read the addition of the vit.And know that the interpreters have disagreed that this verse is a ruling and a legitimate, or is it attached Abu Muslim: Rather, he is attached to the cutting of orphans, for he is the Almighty when he said: If you mix with them, then your brothers and want to mix with the marriage, have to be blessed with what he has to do.And that is what they were crowded with the desire in the companies, and he indicated that a believer nation is better than a partner, and if the end, when it is necessary for it, then it is necessary for you to do so, so that it is necessary for you.On what is sent to twisting orphans, and on the decay of the time at the idiot, so that this will be a reason for what he commanded to look at them, and they are in their goodness, and they are in their goodness, The two guys, the ruling of the verse is not different, and then in the verse: The first question: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, “It is upon him the prayers and peace be upon him.The children of Hashem to Mecca to come out of people from Muslims in a secret, and when his resurrection came to him, his wife came to him: He is the neck of him in the ignorance of him.When Islam, the cell was touched, so he defined it that Islam prevented from that, then he promised it that the Messenger will be authorized ﷺ and then he married it to it He defined him what happened in an embrace, and he asked him, is he to be married to him, so God Almighty revealed this verse?* * * Prayers and peace be upon him: “There is no marriage except for my guardian and witnesses.The second: His saying of peace and blessings be upon him: Marriage is like the opposite of the swimmer, and it is known that the swimmer is disgraceful to the slow, and if the marriage was a name for the slowdown, it would not be forbidden.And the third of it: His Excellency said: And to marry the days of you and the righteous of your servants and your faith [Al -Nur: 32] and there is no doubt that he (to marry) cannot be carried only.And the one who was seen: the saying of the east, the one sought by the one in “Al -Bassit”: “Do not come close to a neighbor if it is pleased with you as forbidden, then he will be forgiven, or you say it:“ Because he said: “Do not come close to a neighbor.” It means that it is approached on the way that is forbidden, and he will be held and married, otherwise you will see and avoid the women, and he said: A truth in the slow, and begged him with his faces: one of them: His exalted say: If you divorce it, then do not be permissible for him after the time of his marriage to him: The solution is extended to the end of the marriage, and the marriage that this is forbidden is not the contract with the same as the saying of it And you taste your affliction.And the second: His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: And the third of it: that marriage in the language is a phrase for the bloodshed and the slow, it is said: the land of the land is marked if it comes to it, and the sleepiness is marked by its eyes, and in the proverb: that it is the same: ؎ The enrichment on the purification of their women ∗∗∗ and the sins of the rituals of the doves, and the delegate said: ؎ I was deaf to the deafness of its feet, the work of it, and it is a good.It is known that the meaning of the annexation and the slowdown in the preacher, I have been completed from it in the contract, so it is obligatory to carry it on it, and from the people who said: the marriage is a burden on the authority of the The slowdown, so it is good for this memory in them all.A gentle separation until the dressing does not get, so if they said: So that so, so that they were so and so that they wanted to marry it and make it a contract, and if they said: Unanimously; Because if he remembers that he is his wife’s marriage or his husband, then he would have used the remembrance of the contract, so the word did not need the unjust, so this is what is in this way, so this is what is in this way, so this is what is in this way, so this is what is in this way.And those who are involved in the fact that what is meant is from his saying: and do not marry in this verse, that is, do not complicate the contract of marriage.* * * The third question: they disagreed that (the participant) is not the infidels from the people of the book, so some of them denied that, and they are more than that of the scholars (The participant) in which the infidels are among the people of the book, which is the choice, And it is indicated by his faces: one of them: the saying of the Almighty: The Jews of the son of God said that the Christians were the son of God They share [the repentance: 31] and this verse is clear that the Judaism and Al -Nasrani are parties.And the second: His Excellency said: God does not forgive that he will be involved in it and forgive what is without that for those who are God.Exalted in the sentence, and if he had disbelieved the Judaism and Al -Nasrani, he would not be a polytheist, then it is obligatory to require this verse to forgive God in the sentence, and if it is the same They are disbelieved, and the third of it is: His Exalted: The disbelief of those who said that God is the third of three [Al -Ma’idah: 73] so this is the sabid Three characteristics, or their intention to provide three, and the first is invalid; Because the concept is from his being, the highest scholar, other than the concept, from his being, and from his being alive.With the attributes of three attributes of the religion of the religion of Islam, how can the Christians atone for this because of that, and when we know that it is up to them, but it is the same.Because they have proven three years old, and therefore they were married in the words of the word that it is permissible in Jesus, and they have been married in the hypnotics of the life of the life that is in the life Were it not for these things that are named at them with the hypotheses, they are based on themselves, when they were married to them from the same to the same, so they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said that they said.With the same as an eternal validity, and this is a blessing, and a saying of the gods of the gods, then they were partners, and if their entry is established under the name of the polytheism; The Judaism must also be the harm that he does not say the difference.And he pushed it: What was narrated, “He has to pray and peace be upon him, and he said: If you meet a number of the participants, call them to Islam.And the consequences of the dhimma, for if they answered you, accept from them and stop them.“P-49) was called whoever accepts the part of the part of it and the contract of the slave to the partner, so it is on the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who accepts the one.Fifth: The father of the deafness of the deafness of the deafness, and he said: Everyone who wounded his abandonment is a partner, from where those miracles that appeared on the one who appeared on the one who appeared on the hand The human beings, and they were denied by God, the Exalted, but they added it to jinn and demons; Because they were saying in it: it is magic and obtained from the jinn and the demons.So the piece is obligatory in their formation.Because there is no meaning to God except those who are able to create this Things.The judge was assumed and said: This is required if the Judais is delivered that he did not appear on the hands of Muhammad ﷺ from the things that are outside the ability Participated, but if he denies that and claimed that what appeared on the hands of Muhammad ﷺ from the gender of what is appreciated God Almighty.The answer: that I do not adhere to its declaration that those miracles are outside the abundance of human beings or not, but the advertisement indicates that this miracle is out of the miracle of the one who is abstaining from the external He attributed this to the other than God, he was a partner, as a human being, if he said: The creation of the body and life from the sweetest of the enemy of the human being, then the one who created the creation of the one who created the one who created the one who created Huther, so, so this is the whole of what indicates that the Jewish and the Nasrani enter the name of the entry.And those who are his father were transmitted that God Almighty separated between the people of the book and between the participants in the remembrance, and that indicates that the people of the book do not enter the name of the So he prayed for his saying: “Those who believed and those who have guided, the Sabeans, the Christians, the Majoub, and those who have been blessed [Al -Hajj: 17] and he also said: What is the affection of those who are the one The participants [Al -Baqarah: 105] and said: The people who disbelieved from the people of the book and the partners were not among the people of the book [Al -Banna: 1] In these verses, he separated between the two divisions, Thus, it is necessary to change.The answer is that this is a problem with the words of the Almighty: And when we took from the prophets, their covenant, from you, and from Noah [Al -Ahzab: 7] and with his saying: Whoever is a mourning for him And Gabriel and Mical [Al -Baqara: 98] If they said: It is specially mentioned by the remembrance that you will be alerted to the talisman in that description of the mentioned, we said: So, it is the same These verses in this name alert it to the options of their degrees in this infidelity, so this is a sentence of what is in this question.Then know that those who say that the Jews and the Christians are lagging behind the name of the polytheist, they disagreed with two sayings: So the people said: “This is the one who is the one who is the one who is.We showed that the Jews and the Christians said that they are evil.Al -Jubayi and the judge said: This name is from the sentence of the law.And they were taken over that, the transmission of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, was called that he was calling everyone who was disbelieving in the polytheist, and whoever is in the infidels is not in the disbelievers.Its existence, or was a doubt about the provisions of the partners, and they were in them who was at the mission of the mission for the resurrection and resurrection, so it was not a denying the abundance of the He worshiped anything from the two, and those who worshiped The second is in them who were saying: It is the partnership of God in creation and the mobilization of the world, but they were saying: These are our lips with God, and they are more That the god of the world is one and that he has no certainty in the creation of the world and his mobilization, and a partner and a counterpart, if this is proven, this appearance is that the name of the name is the name of the name The linguist, but from the legal names, such as prayer and zakat and others, and if it is like that, every disbeliever is required under this name, then this is the word of this.And by God, the Exposition.* * * (P-50) The following question: Those who said: The name of the polytheist is only responsible Those who said: The name of the enthusiastic is the one who informs all the infidels.The people of the book or not, then those who say this saying, they disagreed, and the most of the imams said: It is permissible for the man to marry the writers, and from the authority Hanafi and the guidance, and it is one of the Zaydi imams, that this is forbidden, the pilgrimage of the phrase is the saying of the exalted in Suraidah: The fortified of those who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones All of them are fixed, and nothing is erased.If it was said: Why is it not permissible for what is meant by it: Whoever believes after being among the people of the book?We said: This is not valid by the first to the first of the believers from the believers, and this enters in it in which those who believe in them after the disbelief, and whoever is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who believes.Because his saying: Whoever has the book [Al -Maaidah: 5] will benefit this description in the case of pornography, and what indicates the permissibility of that is what was narrated that the companions were.With the writings, and what appeared from one of them is a denial of that, so this was a gathering on the pity.We say that Harfa was married with a Judaism or a supporter, so he wrote to him Omar to disrupt her path, so he wrote to him: Do you say that she is a forbidden?He said: No, but I am afraid.On the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah, may God be pleased with him, from the Messenger of God ﷺ: It also indicates the famous news, which was narrated by Abd al -Rahman ibn Awf, may God be pleased with him.However, they are not their women, and they did not eat their labels.And those who say that it is not permissible for matters: the first: that the perception of the polytheism is the writer of what he has shown, so he said: Do not marry the?Slear believes in the prohibition of the marriage of writers, specialization and copying is the disagreement of the phenomenon.And that is because he said at the end of the verse: Those are calling for fire and description if the obstacle of the judgment is mentioned, and the description is appropriate for the judgment, so the ruling is that That is the judgment, as if it was the Almighty, he said: I have forbidden you to marry the partners; Because they invite the fire, and this is a standing in the writer, so it is obligatory to be forbidden.The second argument is for them: that Ibn Omar was asked about this question, then the verse of the prohibition and the verse of the solution, and the direction of the exaltation, is that the origin is in the righteousness, The prohibition of the sanctity of the sanctity, so it is obligatory to meet the ruling of the original, and with this way, when he was asked about the gathering between the two sisters in the king of the king, the king of the king, so: And I deprived them of a verse, and you were judged by that of the prohibition for the causes of which we mentioned, so we are so.The third pilgrimage to them: Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri narrated it from Ibn Abbas, the categories of the women are forbidden except the believers, and the one who says: With faith, his work has been lined up [Al -Maaidah: 5], and if it was like that, it was like a single that it is not permissible to mention the contract on it.The faster Hajj: The tougheh of the impact of Omar: It is narrated that the journey of Judaism, and the example of Nasrani, is a fool of life (P-51).Strongly, they said: We are released, O Mir, the believers, so do not get angry.He said: If their divorce is dissolved, then their marriage has been dissolved, but they are removed from you.The first answered the first pilgrimage that the one who said: The Jewish and Al -Nasrani do not enter the name of the shared, so the forms of it is a fallen, and whoever is peace is that: He said: Those who have given the book [Al -Maaidah: 5] is more special than this verse, then the narration is authenticated that this deprivation has proven, then it is still, and it was made.We did not make it a specialty, the maximum in the chapter is that copying and specialization is the disagreement of the original, except that when it was not a way to fulfill between the two vessels, this is not the same.To me.As for his second saying: The prohibition of the marriage of the trick was because it was calling for the fire, and this meaning is based on the writers, we said: The difference is between them With violation and positions, perhaps the husband loves her, then she carries him on the fight with the Muslims, and this meaning is not required in the dhimma; Because it is a murmur, which is satisfied with humiliation and domestication, it is not necessary to obtain that marriage to the fighting.As for his saying third: The verse of prohibition and analysis may have opposed, so we say: But the verse of analysis is a special It is delayed with consensus, so it is necessary to be advanced on the verse of prohibition, and this is by the difference of the two verses in the collection between the two sisters in the king of the king; Because every one of you is the two verses more special than the other than one side and the best of another aspect, so he did not get the reason for it.As for his saying here: and the fortifications are among those who have given the book [Al -Ma’idah: 5] Special than his saying: Do not marry the companies until it believes in the divorce, so it will be divorced.As for the holding of the Almighty saying: His work has been lined up [Al -Maaidah: 5].His counseling: When we dispersed between the writers and between the stretching in many rulings, why is it not permissible for the difference between them also in this judgment?As for the assignment of the impact of Omar, we have said that he said: It is not in deprivation, and if the opposition gets the exaltation, the recipient will fall.And God knows.* * * Fifth question: Each agreed that what is meant is from his saying: until he believes in acknowledgment of testimony and the commitment of the rulings of Islam, and when this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same Faith is a expressions of the inventory of the ritual, and they said: God Almighty has made faith here the end of the prohibition, which is the end of the prohibition, here is the ritual, and it is proven that the faith is in Equalization.And our companions took over the corruption of this gold, with a wage: one of them: that we have shown us many signs in the interpretation of his saying: those who believe in: 3] A expressions of believing in the heart.And the second: His Excellency said: And among the people who say that we believe in God and the last day and what are the believers [Al -Baqarah: 8] And if the faith was for the sake of the righteousness With believers, he lied.And the third of it: His saying: The Arabs said, “We have not said,“ Do not believe in the stones: 14] If faith was a burden on the inventory of the acknowledgment, then it was said: Then they answered their contact with this verse by the fact that the belief in the heart is not possible to see it, so the establishment of the righteousness is based on the righteousness.(P-52) * * * The sixth question: We are transmitted from Hassan that he said: This is a copy of the people of what they had to do with the jokes of the companies.The judge said: The verse is presented on the marriage of the partners, if it is on the way of the habit, not by the law, he prevented and described this verse that it is people; لِأنَّهُ ثَبَتَ في أُصُولِ الفِقْهِ أنَّ النّاسِخَ والمَنسُوخَ يَجِبُ أنْ يَكُونا حُكْمَيْنِ شَرْعِيَّيْنِ, أمّا إنْ كانَ جَوازُ نِكاحِ المُشْرِكَةِ قَبْلَ نُزُولِ هَذِهِ الآيَةِ ثابِتًا مِن Before the law, this verse was a dirt.As for the saying of the Almighty: a believer nation is better than a partner, and if you like it, then it is in the following: The surety is like the division of the division.The question The second: the best is the good benefit, and the meaning: that the shared if it was steadfast in money, camels and proportions, for the believing nation is better than it; Because faith is attached to religion, money, beauty, and proportions are attached to the world, and religion is better than the world, and because religion is the honor of things in every one, and the one is in the authority of the Love, so the benefits of the world will be completed from health, obedience, and the memorization of the money and the children, and when the difference in religion does not get the love, then it does not get the same, so it is not a thing, so it is not a thing, so there is no one from the authority of the people, so there is no That woman, and some of them said: What is meant: a believer nation is better than a shareholder.And know that there is no need for this estimation for two people: one of them: that the word is divorced.The second: that his saying: If you like it, it will be indicated in the rank of freedom; Because the estimation: and if you like it with its goodness, money, or freedom, or its lineage, then all of that is within it under his saying: and if you like it.* * * This is because the verse indicated that the existence of the heat of the blessed free one may be married to the nation, but the help is for the long time Including the remnants of the Muslim free; Because because of the recession in disbelief and faith, I do not vary with the amount of money that arises to it in the giving of marriage, so it is necessary to be the one who will be the one who is the one He has the marriage of the nation, and this is a source of a kind in this question.* * * The following question: In the verse, it is that it is said: Do not marry the companies, it requires the prohibition of the marriage of the polytheism, then his saying: and the mother of the mother It is necessary to marry the partner; Because a note did, do the partnership in the adjective and one of them is a decrease.Say: The marriage of the polytheism is a distress on the benefits of the world, the marriage of the believer is angry at the ends of the last The last is the great, so the question is pushed.And God knows.As for the saying of the Almighty: Do not marry the partners until they believe, so there is no disagreement here that what is meant by all, and that the believer is not permissible for her to be lost from the disbelief, The disbelief.And his saying: And a servant is a good believer than a partner, so the words are in it on the part of what it is presented.As for his saying: Those are calling for the fire, and there are two issues: the first question: this verse is a counterpart of his saying: I do not invite you to the survivor and call me to the success 41].(P-53) It was said: How do they call for fire and may not believe in the fire in the first place, so how do they call it?And his answer: They mentioned in the interpretation of this verse with a face: one of them: They call for what leads to fire, because the phenomenon is that the wife is the suspect of the fool, love and affiliation, and all of that requires the attachment in the demands and the demands, and the requests, and the purposes, That is until the Muslim is transferred from Islam due to the agreement of his love.If it is said: the impossibility of love is from the two sides, so it is necessary for the Muslim to become infidel in the causes of the alphabet and love, and it is also to be able to make the blasphemy to Al -Fifa and Al -Fahba, and if the two impersonations are opposed, it must fall, then the origin of the permissibility remains.We said: The righteousness of this side is because it is possible that the infidel is transmitted from his disbelief, the Muslim is required to be more reward The Muslim from his Islam is the great of the hardship, and the feet on this work is constant between that it is more beneficial and the benefit of it Like this image, it is obligatory to be excluded from the war, for this reason, God is the highest aspect of the prohibition on the side of release.The second method: that in people who carried his saying: Those are calling for fire that they call for the leaving of the fighting and the fighting, and in their leaving and the obligatory prayer, and the ritual This is the one who says this is a difference between the dhimma and between others; The dhimma does not bear its husband on the fight, and the difference appeared.The third one is: that the child who occurs may be called by the infidel to the infidels, and the child becomes from the people of the fire, so this is the prayer to the fire and God is called to the paradise.By visiting the Muslim until the child is a Muslim from the people of Paradise.As for his saying, the Almighty: God calls for paradise and forgiveness with his permission, so he said: The first saying: that the meaning: and the guardians of God is the one who pray God calls for fire, and the guardians of God call for paradise and forgiveness, so there is no crime that is obligatory for the sane person to be around the partner, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has The believers are calling for paradise and forgiveness.The second: that he was greeting him when these rulings have indicated and permitted them and forbade some of them.As for his saying: (with his permission), the meaning is the facilitation of God and his success for the work that he is worthy of paradise and forgiveness, and his opponent is what he said: Except with the permission of God [Yunus: 100] and his saying: It was not for the same to die except with the permission of God [Al -Amran: 145] and his saying: and they are not with him from one of the people of God.Al -Hasan read “and the forgiveness with his permission” by raising; That is, the forgiveness is with its facilitation.As for the saying of the Almighty: He shows his verses to people, so that they may remember, so it is a phenomenon.
