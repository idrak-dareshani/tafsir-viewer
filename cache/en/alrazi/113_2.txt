The Quranic researcher (P-177) said by the Almighty: from the evil of what was created and in it two issues: the first question: In the interpretation of this verse, it is one of them: one of them said: especially; Because God Almighty did not create creation, he is evil from him; Because the surah was descended in resorting from magic, and that is, it is fulfilled by the agent and its dates and soldiers.And the second: He wants hell as if he says: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of Hell and from the stars of what he created in it.And the third of it: from the evil of what was created, he wants from the evil of the varieties of the tales, such as the seventh and the lives, and others, and it is permissible for those who hurt me from the elderly, and it is so It is evil, but it is permissible to enter heaven and human being under a memorial; Because the prevalence was what was obtained in the side of the mind, the good is the use of what is in it; Because the lesson is also overwhelming and in it in which the evils of the feed are brought up and the evil of water and the fire, then it is said: the pain that occurs is the water of water and the fire, With the creation of God, the Exalted, the words of the most speaking, or the generation of the power of God, may God Almighty create in these boundaries, according to what is said The two speakers, and on the two estimates, will become the verse that he is the Heave of the Messenger, peace be upon him, to seek refuge in God from God, so what is it?We said: What is the bad thing about that, and peace be upon him, so he said: I seek refuge in you from you.And he picked it up: He wanted him for what was created from diseases, delicacy, drought, and the types of adversity and pests, and the grave and the judge claimed that this interpretation is false; Because the action of God is not permissible, it is permissible to describe it as evil, they said: It is indicated by his face We seek it, and that is contradictory.The second: that the actions of God are all wisdom and correct, and that is not permissible to say: It is evil.The third: that the action of God, even if it was evil, would describe it, so that it is a evil and God Almighty is for that.The answer to the first: that we have indicated that there is no abuse in his saying: I seek refuge in you from you?And on the authority of the second: that the human being when he hurts with him, then he is a evil, so the memorization was mentioned on the one who said it, as it is in his saying: and a bad reward: [40] And his saying: Whoever is accustomed to you, be accustomed to him with the same as what you have accustomed to you [Al -Baqarah: 194].And on the third: that the names of God are not divorced, then the one who indicates the name of the name of diseases and the deeds is that it is the evil of the saying: 20] And his saying: And if evil touched him, then a supplication is a supplication [Chapter: 51] and peace be upon him said: “And I seek refuge in you from the evil of the nights of night and day.” The second question: they were stabbed by some His saying: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash from the evil of what was created from his faces: one of them: that the one who is referring to him is a people and sits in the judiciary of God and his destiny, or with the judgment of God, or by the authority of God, or by the authority of God, or by the authority of God, or by the authority of God, or by the authority of God, or by the authority of God?If the first is, how is it a matter that he would seek refuge in God from him, and that is because what God has ruled with him and destroyed him, then he is a reality, as if he said: He said: I signed, so seek refuge in me until I do not fall, and if it is not in his judgment and his destiny, then this is a praise in the King of God and his kingdom.And the second: that the one who is referring to it, if the information is the fall, then he does not pay it, then it is not extensive in the recovery, and if it is the knowledge of the fall, then there is no need for the resignation.And the third of it: that the one who can seek from it, if it is reconciled, is how the cost of the cost is required to pay it and its prevention, and if it is a spoil, then it is a person who created it and the one who created it, and it is the one who created it, The proverbs of these youth, to be said: It is not asked what he does and this speech has been disturbed in this book.
