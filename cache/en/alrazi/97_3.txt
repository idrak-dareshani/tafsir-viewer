The Quranic researcher said: The Almighty said: I don’t know what is the night of the destiny, meaning, and you did not reach your knowledge of the absence of its virtue, and it is over.The first: His Excellency said: The night of the destiny is better than a thousand months in which there are questions: the first question: in the interpretation of the verse, the faces of it: one of them is the goodness of it.This is the night, because it is like a man who is said to be said that it is: it is better than a thousand months in which this night was, but it was so that God increases in it.And the second: Mujahid said: He was in the children of the children of a man who would perform the night until he would become and then he will go to it until he touched, so he did a thousand months, so he liked the Lord.And the Muslims are from that, so God revealed this verse, that is, the night of destiny for your nation is a good one of a thousand months of that family who carried the one who carried the weapon.And the third of it: Malik bin Anas said: I see the Messenger of God ﷺ the righteous people, so he shortened the customs of his nation, and he was afraid that they would not be informed of the aspirations of the same as the one who has reached it God is the night of destiny, and it is a good for a thousand people of the nations.And its elevation: Al -Qasim was narrated by Bin Faddah, “On the authority of Issa ibn Mazen, he said: I said to the good bin Ali, peace be upon him It means Ma’awiya, and he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ, he saw in his dreams of the mother of illiteracy, they fill his single, one after one, and in a narration, they will come to the authority of the core.” So that God has revealed to him, and God Almighty revealed: We have revealed it on the night of destiny to his saying: a good one of a thousand months that means the king of the mother of the mother, he said: Umayyad, if it is a thousand months.The judge was stabbed in this face, and he said: What was mentioned from a thousand months in the days of the children of the mother of a long A mother was a slave.(P-31) Know that this stab is weak, and that is because the days of the sons of illiteracy were great days with the right of the world I gave you a night, which is in religious happiness more than that of these worldly happiness.The second question: This verse is in a great evil and in it is a great threat, but the evil is that it is the highest that it is that this night is good, and it is not good, and it is not good.This is like his saying, peace be upon him, for peace be upon him, with Amr ibn Abd al -Waddah [Al -Amiri] is better than my nation’s work to the day of the day His work, but he said: He preferred, as if he says: This is from your loser and the rest is fragmented.And know that those who revived it, as if God worshiped the exalted and a year of years Many righteousness, and whoever lives the month to obtain it with a certainty, as if he revived thirty destiny, it is narrated that the day of resurrection is brought in the argument of the one who worshiped the servants of God A man from this nation, and God worshiped four years, so his reward is more, and the Israeli says: You are just, and I see his reward for more You are afraid of the hurry, so you will worship, and the nation of Muhammad was safe for his saying: God would not be tortured by them and you are in them [Al -Anfal: 33] They worship, for this reason, their worshipers were more rewarding, and as for the supply, it is that he is the highness of the great owner of the entry into the fire.It is saved from that torture, which is entitled to softening a single love, for this has a sign of the greater the state of sin and disobedience.The third question: for a saying to say: It is true of the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: One, how does their honesty understand?The answer is from faces: one of them: that the one verb may differ in goodness and ugliness by the causes of the disagreement of the faces that are joined to him, not to see that the prayer of the prayer of the prayer The feat is like this, with the fact that the image may be contradictory, for the preceding one has fallen from it one rak'ah, and also, then you say to whom it is for whom it is for whom it is.Zahn is a good saying, and if he said it to Al -Nasrani, then a slander that obliges the conjunction, and if his saying, the fortified, then it is necessary to limit it.The positions are with the fact that the image is one in all, but if it said it in the right of Aisha was disbelief, and for that he said: And you calculate it in a hinger, and it is with God, the great of God: [15] He was stabbed in the right of Aisha, who was a nomad in the knowledge, for his saying to him, peace be upon him: Badros, and he was stabbed in all the believers because she is the mother of the believers, and the child has the right to claim to slander the mother, even if he is a disbeliever, but he was stabbed in the Prophet, who was the one who was more He was stabbed in the wisdom of God, as it is not permissible for him to leave him until he marries a Zanish woman, then the saying of his saying: This is a time The most heavier than the mountains, so it has been proven by this that the actions are different from their effects in the reward and punishment for the conflict of its faces, so it is not far from the obedience in the goodness in the goodness in For many obstacles.And the second face in the answer: that the wise of the wise, the grace of it is that the creation is made to obedience, and it makes the time of obedience twice as much.It is easy [Al -Sharh: 5, 6] and twenty times, and once a seventh of the seventh, and at the basis of the Azaminah, and a period of the place of the place, and the one who is the original is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same On the authority of the world, a stronger is likely to the house and Zamzam on the broker of the country, and a period that is preferred by Ramadan over the path of the famous, and a veil (P-32) is preferred Days, and a charity that prefers the night of destiny on the least, and what is meant is what we mentioned.The second face: from the virtue of this night.
