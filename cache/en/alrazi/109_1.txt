Because in the infidels who worship God as Jews and Christians, it is not permissible to say to them: I do not worship what you worship With all; Because in the infidels, whoever believes and has become in terms of worshiping God, then it is necessary to say: His saying: O you who are infidels, the rhetoric of his hearts, with the people of the people who said: God is a year and worship our gods for a year, and the one who has been done, if we had the speech on the public, he entered the specialization, and if we were pregnant with the discourse of his rhetoric, then he did not.The verse is on this one.
