The eighth Quranic researcher in the interpretation of his saying: the path of those who have been blessed with them, and in it the benefits of the first one: in the limit A phrase for the good one on the authority of charity to others, and among them is those who say: the good is the good one on the authority The grace is entitled to thank it, and if it is a chapel, it is not worthy of the thanks, and the truth is that this restriction is not considered, because it is permissible to be fulfilled, if it is a matter It is prohibited, because the side of the merits is not the side of the sin and the punishment, so what is a disgrace in their meeting?Do you not see that the evildoer deserves to be the one who is thankful for the disobedience of God, so why is it not permissible for the matter to be like that.Let us return to the interpretation of the remote limit, so we say: As for our saying: “The one who is good” because the urban harm is not a blessing, and we say: “ Charity “because if it was a truly benefit and the intended of the actor with him, he used to do its own, we do not benefit the one who is the one who does not have a grace, and that is so.If you know the limit of the blessing, then the first of it is separated by it: Na`a, from God [Al -Nahl: 53] Then the grace is on three sections: one of them: a grace that is unique to God by finding it, as it was created and lived.And the second: a blessing that arrived from the side of God, in the appearance of the matter, and in the truth, it is also it, but it came from God Almighty, and that is because it is the Heavy, the Creator is the Creator, and the Creator is the good The blessing, and the creator of the pioneering of the year with that grace in the heart of that blessing, except that it is up to what was done by that grace on the hand of that servant, that was the servant of that But thank you for the truth is God Almighty, and this is what he said: I thank me and your father to the fate [Luqman: 14] So he started with himself, not to be on the authority of God God.And the third of it: a blessing that came from God to us by obedience, and it is also from God Almighty; Because if God had not been glorified and exalted, we have succeeded in the obstacles and helped us to them and guided us to it and removed excuses from us, otherwise we did not reach anything from them, so he appeared in this God Almighty.The second horoscope: that the first blessings of God on the servant is that they created them with life, and the mind and transmission are indicated by the mind, but the mind is that the thing is not a matter of time.Including it, and it is not possible for him to do with it (P-209) life, for the beauty and dead can not be intend All of the blessings is life, and the transmission is that it is the highest.All [Al -Baqarah: 29] So he started the remembrance of life and praised the remembrance of the things that he benefits from, and that indicates that the origin of all blessings is life.The third branch: they disagreed that it is for God to be blessed with the infidels of the infidel or not?Then some of our companions said: God does not come to the infidel, and the dismissed said: God has a religious rhythm and a religious blessing.The companions took on the authenticity of their saying by the Qur’an and the mind: the Qur’an is verses.One of it: His Excellency said: The path of those who have been blessed with them and that, because if God had the infidel to the infidels, they would have been inside.And if that would have been his saying: We guided the righteous path, the path of those who have been blessed with a request for the infidels, and that is false, so that it is clear.God has a blessing on the infidels, so if they said: His saying “the path” is pushed by that.The straightforward, so the ability was the path of those who have been blessed with them, and then the warnings will return.The second verse: His Excellency said: He does not count those who disbelieved, but we have a good for them to be good for them The blessings of the world in the metaphor of the torment of the hereafter on a little bit like the diameter in the sea, and the same is not a grace, with the way that whoever made the poison in the thickness of the poison is not in From it a grace for the sake of that, that benefit is a vile in the interview of that frequent warning, so we are here.As for those who said that God has a great blessings, they have been brought up with verses: one of them: He said: O people, you worship your Lord, whoever creates you Perhaps you will fear the one who has made you a butterfly and heaven based on a constructive [Al -Baqarah: 21-22], so he warned that it is obligatory for all the obedience of God to the place of this.And the second: His saying: How do you disbelieve in God and you are honest, so I will give you [Al -Baqarah: 28].And the third of it: His Excellency said: My family, I remember my blessing that I have been blessed with you [Al -Baqarah: 40].And its elevation: His Excellency said: And a few of my servants of thanksgiving [Saba: 13] and the saying of Absis: Do not find the most of them, Shakrin [Al -A'raf: 17] and if you did not get the goodness And there was no need for their feet on the thank you; Because thank you can only be when the grace is obtained.The second one: His saying: We guided the straight path, the path of those who have been blessed with it.On the imam of Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him; Because we mentioned that the verse of the verse is the guidance of those who have been blessed with them, and God Almighty has shown in another verse that those who have been blessed with God: With those who have been blessed by God from the prophets and the righteous, the verse [Women: 69] nor doubt that the heads of the righteous and their heads are the father of the righteous, the one who is the one who is the friend of the friend That God commanded us to ask the guidance that Abu Bakr al -Sadiq was the righteous and the paths of the righteous, and if the father of the unjust was unjust, then it is permissible for him to do so.The significance of this verse on the imam of Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him.The third one: His saying that you have been blessed with them.And when the first prolonged it, it was proven that the one who is intended for the grace of religion, so we say: Every grace (P-2110) is religious except in faith, so it is a coordination with the origin of faith, and the faith is the faith It can be obtained from the path of religious blessings, and this indicates that what is meant is from his saying: You have been blessed with them is the grace of faith, so he returns to the saying The straight path is the path of those who have been blessed with them that it is a request for the blessing of faith.What is meant by this grace is the grace of faith, and the verse is clear in that God is exalted is the blessing of this grace; It was proven that the creator of faith and given to faith is God Almighty, and that indicates the corruption of the saying of the dismissed He was honored and higher than God, and if he was like that, he would not be good for God to remember his cattle in the exposure of excess.The second judgment: It is obligatory that the believer do not remain in the fire, because it was said: You have been mentioned in the disposal of the exhibition of the exaltation of this, and for this, and for this, and for this, and for this, and for this, and for this, and for this, and for this, and for this.Pinch of the persistent punishment was a few of the good, as it was good from God, the highness of his remembrance in the symptom of the greatest.The third judgment: The verse indicated that it is not obligatory for God to spare the righteousness and righteousness in religion, because if the guidance was obligatory for God, it was not that; Because the duty of the duty is not a grave, and where God called him, the exalted, we know that it is not and is obligatory.The ruling is the ruling: It is not permissible for what is meant by the public is that God Almighty is able to cost him and guide him to Him and remove his excuses and his prayers from him; Because all of that is in the right of the infidels, when God summarized some of those who are associated with this year, with this estimation and displacement of the heart is general in the right Everyone knows that what is meant from the year is not the destruction of it and the displacement of the obstacles from it.* * * The ninth chapter in its saying is the highest of the angels, and the one who is lost in it, in which the benefits of the first one: the famous that the angel is the one who is the one To say to him: Whoever curses God and anger on him [Al -Ma’idah: 60] and the ribs: The Christians are for his saying: “They have gone astray from before and preferred a lot.” It was said: This is weak; Because the denial of the laws and the partners are the most important of the debt of Jews and the Christians, so it was the one who was unable The phenomenon is the immorality, and those who are lost to everyone who sinned in the belief is carried out because the memorization is general, and the tradition is the disagreement of the origin, and it is necessary to say: the angry: The disbelievers, and those who are expended, are the ones who spend, and that is because it is the highest of the remembrance of the believers and the praise be upon them in five verses from the first cow, then the cow, then the cow, then the remembrance of it, then it is the remembrance of it His saying: Those who disbelieve [Al -Baqarah: 6] Then he followed him with the remembrance of the hypocrites, and he is saying: And from the people who says: “Al -Baqarah: 8], then he is so.” His saying: You have been blessed with them, then follow him with the remembrance of the infidels, and he said: It is not angry with them, then follow him with the remembrance of the one who said: The second one: when God ruled with them, they are lost, and they are forbidden to be believers.The transfer is a referral.(P-211) The third third: His saying: other than the angels, or the lost, indicates that one of the angels and the prophets have to be upon them.Those who have been blessed with them, and not to be able to do those who have been blessed with them, because if he had been issued from him, then he has gone out of the truth, so he said: The truth is only delusion [Yunus: 32] and if they were lost, they would not be fulfilled by them, nor to feed them with their way, and they were outside his saying: that you have said: Our knowledge of this verse is the grace of the prophets and the angels, peace be upon them.The loyal one: the anger is absent from the blood of the heart for the lust of the righteousness.All the symptoms of the enforcement - the meaning of mercy, joy, pleasure, anger, the life, the other, the deception, the deception, the arrogance, and the mockery - for it, and it is the end of it, and it is the end of it The blood of the heart, and its goal is to communicate the release to the angry against it, so the anger was kept in the right of God, the Almighty, who is not carried on the first of whom is the one who is the one who is the one who is the heart of the heart of the heart Rather, it is the will of the harm, and it is also a life for him first, and it is a break that gets in the soul, and he has a struggle while he left the verb, so let him notice the life of God in the right of God The verb is not the same as the same as a mourning base in this section.Fifth: The disgrace said: God is angry with them, which indicates their being, and they are active to the homes by choosing them.Our companions: When God's anger was mentioned to them and followed him by remembering them, as they were lost, this is the same as that God is angry with them, and the heart of them is a reason for them The description of God will be influential in the adjective of the servant, but if we say that their being lost, God is angry with them.God Almighty, and that is referred.The sixth is the first: the first of the surah is a disgrace to the praise of God and the praise is upon him and the praise be to Him It is indicated that the one who is lonely and the title of the goods is to be overlooked by God Almighty, and the pests and the heads of fear are the symptoms of God, and the distance from God.The fabrication: This verse indicated that the two costs are three teams: the people of obedience, and the signal is with its saying: that you have been blessed with them, Referring to his saying, other than those who are angry with them, and the people of ignorance in the religion of God and the infidels, and the sign of the sign is by saying and not lost.If it was said: Why did the remembrance of the disobedience be presented to the remembrance of the disbelief?We said: Because every one is excluded from infidels, but it may not be treated for immorality, then it was the most important, for this reason was presented.The eighth: in the verse a question, which is that the anger of God is generated by his knowledge with the chains of the cubic and the crime from it, so this knowledge is either that it is said that it is, or it is that it is Knowledge is valid, and he did not create it and did not break it from the numbers to the existence with his knowledge that he does not benefit from his entry into the provision except for the suffering, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one How does his resurrection be able to find it and to form it?But if that science is an acute, the righteous is a solution for the analytics, and because it is necessary that the events of that science decide on the predecessor of another knowledge, and it is a matter God does what he gives and governs what he wants.The ninth: in the verse is another question, which is that whoever blesses God is forbidden to be angry with him and that (P-2212) will be from the lost, then he said: On them, what is the benefit is that his mind mentioned, “other than the angry, or the lost”?And the answer: Faith is complete with hope and fear, as peace be upon him: “If he is a fear of fear The believer and his hope for them are in accordance with the path of those who have been blessed with them.The whole, and then faith strengthens his pillars and his two parties and ends up to the limit of the fullness.Those who have been blessed by God, and the two paradoxes: the angry about them, and those who are lost?The knowledge of the truth is for itself and the best for the sake of doing it with it, so they are the ones who are in his saying that you have been blessed with them.To them, as he said: And whoever kills a believer is deliberate, then his hell is made of hell, empty in it, and God is angry with him and cursed him [Women: 93] and if he is the one who does not know Hope: What is the right after the truth [Yunus: 32] and this is the last of our words in the interpretation of each one of the verses of this surah on detail, and God knows.
