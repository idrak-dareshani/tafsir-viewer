The Quranic researcher is the same one in divorce and divorce, and they are three readers of themselves.And the last day is the Almighty saying: The divorced women are lengthening themselves with three readers, and it is not permissible for them to give you what God has created in the mercy of God The last.Know that he is the highest mentioned in this position many rulings for the divorce: the first judgment of the divorce is the path of the number: I know that the divorced woman is the one who is the divorce It is on it, and it is either to be foreigners or an offense.The definition of the law, and the number is not other The enemy is upon her, God Almighty said: (P-74) If you are married to the believers, then you divorced them before they touched them, so what you have to do is from them Entering it, then it is either a bearer or a pregnant woman, then if you are a pregnant, then I prepare it with the status of the bearing, not by the readers.[Divorce: 4] As for if it is a barrier, it is that the menstruation is possible in its right or not, then if the menstruation is forbidden in its right, either for the minimum of the excessive or for the excessive or the excessive I prepared it with the most famous, not by the readers.Free, if it was a dance, it was her promise, not by three, but if you were a woman, it was divorced after the entry, and it was from the entry, and it was from the entry It was free, and when these attributes were met with the three readers of the three readers of what God has shown in this verse.* * * In the verse, asking: the first question: the general is good, it is more special if the rest after the specialization is more than where the habit has gone through the release of the ritual.The garment: It is a supplier: if the predominance of it is black, or he has a little white in it, but if the prevalence is overwhelming, and the blackness was a little, then it was a few, then it was not.Licked, and it was proven that the condition in the general of the public is a specialty that the rest is after the specialization more, and this verse is not like that, then you are the same And you left one section, so the publication of the year is like this position, which does not follow the ruling of God Almighty.The answer: As for the foreigners, it is out of the memorial; Foreign people are not said: It is Extracting, and it is not the insertion of it, so the villages are brought out.Because the intended of the enemy is the righteousness of the womb, and the need for the brightness does not happen until the precedent of the work, and the bearer and the essay are outside the words; Because the positive ones are more than the ones who are more than the readers, but the readers are obtained, and these two sects did not get the readers in their right, and as for the diligence, it is like it.The world is the most uniqueness.* * * The second question: Its saying: they are stagnant, no doubt that it is a news, and what is meant by it is the matter, so what is good in the expression of the matter is the word?The answer is from Wajin: The first: It is up to him, if he mentioned it to the memorial of the matter, then it was delusional that it does not get the intended unless you seek the sake of this If the husband died, and the woman did not know that until the enemy was destroyed, then this should not be sufficient in the intended; Because it was when it was commanded by that, it was not removed from the entrepreneur, unless it is intended to perform the cost, but when God mentioned the Almighty, this is the good.It was known that it was not the same as this enemy.Al -Thani: The owner of the scout said: Expression of the matter of the form of the news, it is beneficial to the affirmation of the matter, a notice of that it must be attached to the rushing, so that it is related to its compliance.The matter is by leisure, as it tells it a struggle, and his counterpart is their saying in the supplication: “May God have mercy on you.” He tells it.* * * The third question: If he said: The divorcees are slaughtered, then a sentence of verb and effective, then the rule is in leaving (P-75) that, and made the divorcees, His saying: They stir with the chain of transmission to the actor, then make this sentence a news about that beginner.The answer: Sheikh Abd al -Qahir al -Jarjani said in the book of the misfortunes of the miracle: If you offer the name, then you said: Zuid is action, then this is beneficial from the affirmation and the affirmation of what is not.He did more; And that is because your saying: a good, action, is used in two things, one of them: that it be to specialize that the actor with that action, like the one who says: Sultanate, and what is meant is the pretext of man.The second: That the intended is not that, but it is intended to be presented with the remembrance of the speaker about it with a hadith such as this to prove that act, as is the saying He wants to exclusively, but to be achieved at the Samaid that giving the reward be his heart, and the same is the saying of the Almighty: and those who pray from the one without God do not.They create [bee: 20] that is not intended to specialize the creature, And the Almighty said: And if they came to you, they said: We believed and they entered the infidelity while they were released with it [Al -Ma’idah: 61], and the poet said: ؎ They are the goodness of the grandfather Both of them are obeyed, and the reason for this meaning is when you are able to mention the beginning of the beginning that if you say: the servant of God, then you will not feel that you will be.The mind is longing to the knowledge of that, so if you mention that news, the mind accepted it.* * * The fourth question: It was said: Three readers are looked at, as it was said: four months are listed [the cow: 226] and what is good in the remembrance of the soul.Answer: In the remembrance of the same, they will make them happy with a leisure and increase the mission; Because there is what he will stop from it, so they can carry them on the authority of them.That is because the women breathed out of the men, so he wanted to summarize themselves and overburden them with the ambitious and forced it to be overburdened.* * * The fifth question: “Self” is a few, with a lot of soul The three readers are a few.The answer is that they can expand in that, so they use each one from the Fridays, the place of the other for their partnership in the sense of gathering, or perhaps the reader was in the past, it was more Reading from the readers.* * * The sixth question: Why did he not say: Three readers, as it is said: three menstruation.The answer: Because he followed the memory of the word, and the recitation of the reciter is mentioned.This is what is related to the questions in this verse, and the rest of the words in this verse are one question in the truth The name of the reciter falls on menstruation and purification, Abu Ubaidah said: The readers are from the fading in the words of the Arabs, and the famous is that it is a truth in them, such as the lick of the name, Others: It is a truth in the menstruation, a metaphor in the purification, and among them is the one who reflected the matter, and they said: It is a place in which one is one of the one who is bought, and the one who is bought, The saying, they disagreed with three sayings: The first is that the reciter is the pleasure, then at the time of menstruation, blood will be gathered in the womb, and in (P-76) and the time of the purification, the purity is in the time The saying of Al -Asma’i, Al -Akhfash, Al -Farah, and Al -Kisae.And the second saying: It is the saying of Abu Ubaid: It is a reflection of the transmission from condition to condition.And the third saying: It is the saying of Abu Amr ibn Al -Alaa: that the reciter is the time, it is said: I read the stars: if you come up, and read: if it is leveled, and it is said: this is the reader Her grapes, and sought for this: ؎ If the wind readers, and if it is proven that the reciter is the time, he entered in which menstruation and purification are entered.Because all One of them is a certain time, and he knows that he is up to the divorced woman, to be accustomed to three readers, and the most prominent is that if it is used to three things, three things are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things that are three things, The taklava, except that the scholars have gathered on that it is not enough for that, but it must be accustomed to three readers from one of the two genius God is from him that it is the wealth, it was narrated from Ibn Umar, Zayd and Aisha, and the seven jurists, the owners and the righteous, and Ahmad, may God be pleased with them, and said: Masoud: It is the nickname, and he is the saying of Abu Hanifa, Al -Tuiri and Al -Awazi and Ibn Abi Lali, and Ibn Shabarmah, and Isaac, may God be pleased with them.The difference of the difference is that the duration of the enemy with the Shafi’i is shorter, and they have a longer, even if it divorced it in the event of purification, the rest of the purity is calculated, and the rest of the purity is in the way of the purity, and the rest of the purity is in the way of the purity, The case, if it is prescribed in the third urbanization, it will be fulfilled, and when Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, did not purify it from the time of the third time, if it was the one who was in the same time The luxurious urbanization, if in the event of menstruation, it is not judged by the elimination of its enemy, then he said: If it is purified, it will be more urged, then it will be made before the wash, and it is the same, and it is the same.Its promise to get rid of it, or it will be seen at the time of the water, or the time for it is spent.The argument of Al -Shafi’i from the faces: the first pilgrimage: His Exalted: So they divorced them because of their promise [Al -Iqqa: 1] and its meaning is at the time of their time, for the time of the time, for the time of the time, for the time of the time, for the time of the time, About him, so the time of the enemy is required for the time of the time of menstruation.The month, he wants to be accepted for three, and I say: This speech strengthens the recipient of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him; Because the saying of the saying: For three people from the month, it is for a while, the hurricane falls in the three of his mind, so this is what we said: so he divorced them: They divorced them in terms of horror in the enemy, and when the matter was bound by all the time of purification, the purification must be from the time The enemy, and that is the one.The second Hajj: What was narrated from Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that she said: Do you know what is the readers?Read: Agency.Then Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: And the people of this know; Because this is afflicted by women.The third pilgrimage: “The reciter” is a phrase of collection, it is said: What the camel has read is a cat, that is, what was collected in its womb, a little, and from it the saying النال The laughter did not read our gin and said the fear: It is said: I have not read a humiliation, meaning: what has mercy on its mercy on a humiliation, and the name of the basis is a reader.Because it collects the water in it, and the stars read: if they gathered to the Ghazroub, and the Qur’an is called Quran for the fulfillment of its letters and its words and the greatness of the science.The reader read; That is, some of the forefathers set it up to each other.Because blood gather in that time in body.If it was said: Why is it not permissible to say: Rather, the time of menstruation is overlooking this name; Because blood gather in this time in the womb.We said: Development is not gathered in the deadly mercy, but the diameter is separated from a drop, but the time for purification is all in the body, so it was the meaning of the sake of the time The report in it is that the name of the reciter is what is indicated by the reassurance, so the most accurate conditions of the mercy and the detection in the blood are the last purification; If it was not filled with that excess, when it was desired to the outside, then from the first purification, it is taken in the meeting and the increases to the last, and the last is the case of the same The purification is the reading in the truth, and this is clear words.The third pilgrimage: that the origin is that no one is on one of the minds that are not the right The least called the three readers, which are the wealth.Because the one that is reluctant to be leaned is less time than the one that is inverted in the presence, when it was also the least of our pronouncement - the harm of the work with this verse - and the most of our wounds is the most.The origin is that no one will be the ability to be seen and forbidden.The fourth pilgrimage: that the appearance of his words is up to the Almighty: the divorced women are lengthening themselves with three readers, it requires that if it is accustomed to three things, it will be done.The covenant, and every one of the purification and from the menstruation is called this name, so the woman should be brought out of the truce with any of them, which was on the authority The enemy with the leaf is less than the period of the enemy in the presence, so this is the woman who is good between that you are used to the deficient period or the time of the time It is able to leave the increased destiny, not to a substitute, and everything that was like that was not obligatory, so the one who is more accustomed to the extensive destiny is over the period That it is not the one that is inverted in the period of menstruation, and it is the one who is required.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, from his faces: The first: that the readers are in the language, even if it is partner between the rituals and the menstruation, except that in the legitimacy, it is in the city of When it was narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “He called the prayer the days of your readings.” The second argument: that the saying That the readers can be in place with which three readers can be seen; Because this saying says: The divorced woman is obligated to leak three lives, but it is removed from the task with the shame of the third time, and whoever says: It is the one who says: The enemy with the readers and some third; Because if he divorces it at the end of the purification, you will be used to a reciter, then if it is in one of the two sayings, the three readers will be completed without the saying, the one who is the one is the one who is the one who said the first saying Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, answered that God said: The pilgrimage is the most knowledgeable one [the cow: 197] and the most famous is a collection and the least of it is three, then we are The third, and that is a shawl, and the seat, and some of the pilgrimage, so this is so it is permissible for these three to be carried on two purities and some of the purity The one who is dismissed from this answer is from two faces: The first: We left the apparent in that verse for an indication, so we did not have to leave the phenomenon here.The second: that in (P-78) the enemy is a coincidence, so it is imperative that the three of the three must, and the most famous pilgrimage; Because there is no connected verb in it, as it was said: This is the most famous of the pilgrimage, not on the way of the darkening, and the delayed from our companions answered from our companions from our companions from our companions from this The first: Just as he carried the readers on the noms, the two must decrease the three, so he carried it on the lives, it is obligatory.Because if he divorced it in the formation of purification, what remained of the purification is not a sense of the number, then the increase will obtain, and their excuse for it is that this is not for it to be Driver; Because if it is permissible to divorce in the menstruation, we would not have the right to divorce it until it is accustomed to complete fully fascinating, and if the divorce is concluded with the purity, it becomes the same.For freshness, we also say: When the readers became an informative of the tenderness, and God Almighty commanded the divorce in the purification, the destiny of the verse has become: Three backfires, the purification of divorce in it.And the second face in the answer is that we have indicated that the reciter is a name for the meeting and the fullness of the meeting, but it will be completely read in the end of the purification.The decrease in something of recitation.The third pilgrimage to them: that he is transmitted to the Shahur when the menstruation of menstruation, and he said: The one who descends from the menstruation of your women, if you arise, then the one is the same.The famous people held the shrine of the menstruation without the noms, and also when the famous people were made instead of the readers and the substance is considered to be perfect, so the most famous is that it is not necessary Al -Kamal is considered in the field, so it is necessary for the full readings to be the same.The righteous argument for them: His saying ﷺ: The number of free is the menstruation.Fifth Hajj: We are all over that the monitoring is in the purchase of the neighborhood, and it is in the sense, so the number is with the presence; Because the intended is one of the desirabilities and the number is one thing.The sixth pilgrimage to them: that the original abuse in the enemy is the desirability of the mercy, and the menstruation is the one in which the womb is absent without the purification, so it is necessary for it to be The purification.The argument that is the following: that the saying is that the reader is the presence of the stomach and the abuse of the prohibition of the sanctity; Because the divorced woman, if the rest of the purification passed, and stabbed in the third urbanization, then if we make the reciter, it is the menstruation, then it will be forbidden for it, then it is forbidden for it to be forbidden.The reciter is a purification, then it is permissible for others to marry it, and the sides of the prohibition are first in the pursuit; To say it ﷺ: ““ The forbidden and the permissible are unanimously gathered and the halal deprivation is overwhelmed.To say it ﷺ: “Leave what is deprived of you to what does not preach you.” This is the sentence of faces in this section.He knew that when this face is weakened, the rituals are weakened, and the judgment of God is in the right of all that has led to it.As for his saying, the Exalted: It is not permissible for them to give you what God created in their wombs, so know that the elimination of the number is what was based The bearing is in the right of the carrier, and the prayer was to the knowledge of that (P -79) for the men who were excused - the woman was made a mother in the number, and the saying was made if it was said if you claim it if it was called if it was called.A period that can be in it, and it is on the authority of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, thirty and three hours.Because her matter is carried on the fact that she divorced a purifier and she was inconited after an hour, then she was menstruating one day and night, and he is the least menstruation, and then the one who was one of the length of the day, One day and night, then five days were purified, and then the blood saw, and her promise was passed by with the three of the three, so that this is the same, so that this She accepted her saying, and so if she was a bearer, she claimed that she was dropped, the saying was her saying; Because she is at the origin of her safety.* * * Know that the two interpreters have in his saying: God did not create three sayings: the first: the first: that it is the rope and the menstruation together; That is because the woman has many purposes in their kisses, but the hibor of the rope is that it was imposed in it that it is the elimination of its enemy with the least, less than the time Candle, then if the rope is bound, the period of its promise will be raised, then it is married to a speedy, and perhaps it was hated by the first husband, and maybe I loved The husband is with another husband, or she loved to fulfill her son with the second husband, for these purposes, the rope are bound.The husband is one of the readers, she loves to develop her enemy, so that the first husband will come back, and she may love to shorten her enemy, so that she will not be bound, and he did not That is only a hierarchy in some of the facts; Because if she is menstruating first, she will be hidden, then she appeared at the second menstruation, that the first of her menstruation, then the enemy took long, and if the time is the same So, and if it is fulfilled, it remains that it remains, then the return cut off on its husband, then it has proven that it is as it has a suppression in the curse of the rope, so that it is in the heart of the rope.It is obligatory to carry the prohibition on the group of the two things.The second saying: that what is meant is the forbidding of the killing of the pregnancy only, and begging for it with its faces: one of them: the saying of the Almighty: He is the one who is praying Amran: 6].And the second: that the menstruation is out of mercy, not that it is created in the womb.And the third of it: that the carrying of his words is the Almighty: God did not create in their wombs on the child who is a mourning jewel, and the first of his pregnancy on the menstruation, which is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing, which is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is the thing that is in the menstruation, which is something This face is weak; Because when the intended was prevented from hiding these conditions, which I do not see it, others are on it, and by her, the conditions of the forbidden and the solution are different in the rituals of the sake everyone.The third saying: What is meant is the prohibition on the costume of the menstruation; Because this verse was returned to the mind of the remembrance of the readers, and the remembrance of the lamb was not presented, and this is also weak; Because his saying: It is not permissible for them to give them what God created in their wombs as a desired words, which are transmitted by itself from what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what he is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added to what is added.Everything that is created in the womb.As for the saying of the Exalted: If he believes in God and the last day, it is not what is meant that that is forbidden to be a believer, but this is what is wrong with this If you are a believer, do not oppress, you want if you are a believer, so we will not be forbidden by your faith from my injustice, and there is no doubt that this is a hardship, and he is a hardship, and he is a hardship, and he is a hardship.For he is the sinner of his heart [Al -Qarra: 283] and he said: If some of you are safe, then he will be fulfilled who has believed his safety, and he will fear God, the Lord of God: 283] Whoever has been made is safe in something in which he is in it, then he commanded him with God.* * * (P-80) and their dependence is the right to their cold in that if they want to give and they are like them as those who have to be known to the well-being and the men, and the man is upon them.Hope: And they are their right to their response in that if they wanted to give and have the same as the one They have the well -known and the men and the men of God, and God is a wise, and I know that this is the second judgment of the divorce, and it is the man To be, such as the state, the male, the newness, and the general, and this distraction is an affirmative, affirmative to the inheritance of the group, and it is not permissible to enter it in every gathering, but rather, in the family of the family of the The Arabs, so it is not said in a heels: kaoubah, nor in a dog: a dog, and know that the name of the heart is what is perceived in which the Zojan is bought, so it is said to the woman: Many of the languages, and a husband, in the most correct languages, they are because they are, as they are Zojan, and the origin of the Lord is the money, when it was said, it is said: Who is this?As it is said: from her Lord, and by the name of a idol they were taking it as a Lord, and the women were inviting their marriage to the masters.The second saying: that the curse is a source, it is said: the man is allegedly, if it becomes a height, and the man is removed from his wife: if he cursed it, and in the hadith that he said: “It is days of eating, drinking, and cursing.” And the woman of good deeds: if it is good for the twelve of her husband, and the hadith is: They are their dependents.* * * As for his saying: they have the right to their return in that, the meaning: the right of their return in the period of that confusion, and here we are asking: the first question is: there is no one: The right of the husband in that?The answer is from Wajin: The first: that he said before this verse: It is not permissible for them to be given what God created in their wombs as if you are able to do the words of the words: To marry another husband, then if they do so, the first husband was the right of their cold; That is because the second husband had a right in the shadow, so he indicated that the first husband is more right than it, and if you claim that its readings then know, then it is the knowledge of the first Other husband in the number.The second: If it is usual, then it is in the past the right of the obedience of marriage, so when they have this right that includes the heroes of the right of the husband, it is permissible to say: It is more worthy of where they have to be invalidated by the return of the return, which they are on the authority.* * * The second question: What is the meaning of the response?Answer: It is said: I repeated it, that is, I returned it, he said: The Almighty said in a position: And if I was repeated to my Lord [Al -Kahf: 36] and in another position: and if I was brought back [5] The third question: What is the meaning of response in the absolute divorced?It is as long as it is in the enemy, as it is his husband as it was.The answer: The response and the return include the heroes of the table and the investigation in the number, as it is as long as it is in the number as if it was running in the heroic of the right of the husband, and the background That is, so the fee is called a response, especially and the (P-81) Al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, that he is forbidden to enjoy it, except for the sake He gave it two things, one of them: its response from the table to its dispute.The second: it is returned from the prohibition to the solution.* * * The fourth question: What is the useful in the words of the Almighty: in that.The answer: that the right of response is established in the time that is the time of the table, then if that time is fulfilled, then the right of the response and the return.As for the saying of the Almighty: If they want to pray, then the meaning is that the husband has the right to this briefing if they wanted to pray and what they wanted to hardened, and his counterparts said: They wrapped them, so they will hold them with a well -being, or they will leave them with a well -being, and do not hold them light, to be prepared, and whoever does that, then he did not do so.That in the ignorance they used to return the divorces, and want that harmful to them to divorce them after the return, until the woman needs a sharpness, so that the woman needs a sharpness, so that the woman needs a sharpness, They were from that, and made the condition in the solution of the reaction to the will of the righteousness, and it is his saying: if they want to pray.If it is said: The word “for the condition, and the condition requires that the judgment be extinguished when it is optimistic, so it is necessary if the will is not found that it does not prove.The answer is that the will is an inner adjective that is not briefed on it, for the legs did not stop the authenticity of the bull If he had returned it to the intention of the muddle, he deserved the ingredient.As for the saying of the Exalted: They have the same as the one who is upon them, so I know that it is up to what he indicated that it must be the one who is intended to be the one who is the case, and the condition of it is not the case, not the condition of it.Each one of the two husbands is truly on the other.He knew that the intended of the two husbands is not fulfilled unless each of them is consistent with the right of the other, and those common rights are many, and we are noticeable.One of them: that the husband is like the prince and the shepherd, and the husband is like the commanding and the parish, so it is obligatory for the husband because of his prince and the shepherd to do so It is necessary for it to be the purity of the purity and obedience to the husband.وثانِيها: رُوِيَ عَنِ ابْنِ عَبّاسٍ أنَّهُ قالَ: ”إنِّي لَأتَزَيَّنُ لِامْرَأتِي كَما تَتَزَيَّنُ لِي“ لِقَوْلِهِ تَعالى: ولَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ.And the third of it: They have the husband from the will of the righteousness at the bull, such as what they have to leave the killing when God created them in their wombs, and this is the same.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: The men have a degree, and he has two issues: the first question: it is said: a man among the man, that is, the power, and he is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man, who is the man.Any bareness, and a mare [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection
