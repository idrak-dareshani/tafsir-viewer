The Quranic researcher, and his words said: He who made the earth to you with a bed and the sky with a constructive and descended from the sky with water, so he brought it out of the fruits, and they will not make it.You know about it: And glorification, either to be a lifting of the appetite, and in it what is in the poison of praise.The second question: (which is a word that is a subject to the signal to a single when it is an adaptation of his knowledge with a known judge, as the one said: A divorced woman, and his father is a muddy judgment, so if you try to know the man with this muddy case, you will enter the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is: It is used to describe the acquaintances of the phrase, if this is proven, then he said: The one who made you the ground for you is a bed and the sky with a construction that requires that they were the scholar of the scholar.A butterfly and the sky, and that fulfills his words of exalted: and if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say to God [Luqman: 25].The third question: that God is the highest of five types of evidence, two of the soul and three of the horizons, so he started first with the words of you, and he said: It is his saying: Those who are before you and thirdly: the ground is a butter, and a row: the form of the sky with a constructive, and fifth: the matters that occurred from the gathering of the poison, and it is the one who is the same He descended from the sky with water, and he brought it out of the thunderbolt to you.And for this path of reasons, the first: that the closeness to the human being himself, and the knowledge of the human being in the same ways of itself is more than his knowledge, and if it is the same Knowledge, the more it appeared, the more powerful it was a benefit, and it was the first of the remembrance.For this reason, the remembrance of the soul of the human being, then he folds it with his fathers and mothers, then one third of the earth; Because the earth is closer to the human heaven and human being known to the state of the earth than it in the hearts of the sky.Because that is like the matter generated from the sky, the earth, and the effect is delayed from the influence, for this reason, God has removed his remembrance of the remembrance of the earth and the heavens.The second: It is that the creation of the costs is a life that is close to all of the blessings, and the creation of the earth, the sky and the water, so that it is beneficial to it with the condition of the condition of the creation and the one who is the condition of the creation And lust, so the male of origins is presented to the rivers.(P-94) The third: that everything in the earth and the sky is from the evidence of the laws, so it is in the human being, and he has obtained in the human being from the evidence that did not get them; Because the human being obtained life, ability, lust, and mind, And all of that is what one is unable to be exalted.When the sofa of the evidence was for him, he was fulfilled, he was the first to be able.And know that, as we mentioned the reason for the installation, let us remember what is in every one of these three of the benefits.* * * The following question: Know that he was greeting him and the Almighty mentioned here that he made the land a butter, and his counterpart is his saying: the security of the land is the same, and he made it a decree.And his saying: The one who made the earth to you is a paved [Taha: 53, Al -Zakhfar: 10], and know that the land of the land is a bed, and the things are made by things: the first condition: Because if she was a subversive, she would have moved her either by righteousness or at a running, then if you were in righteousness, then it was a bed for us from the launch A high position that had to not reach the earth because the earth is an amateur, and that human being is an amateur, and the earth is less than the human being, and the two rituals, if they come down, were the heaviest of them, and they did not.The speedy, so the human not to reach the earth, so it was proven that if it was an amateur, it would not have been a bed.As for if I had moved it with the running, we would not complete our benefit with it; Because the movement of the earth is for example if it is to the brightness and the human being, he wants to move next to the western side, nor is it doubtful that the movement of the earth was faster, and it would have been obligatory, so it would have been necessary for it to be.It is possible to reach him where he wants, so when he is able to know that the earth is not destroyed, not by the context, nor with the righteousness, it is a place.Then they differed in the reason for that silence on its face You are firmly stabilized.And the second: Those who greeted the bodies.And from the time of the ethics if it is simplified to tick the water and the air like the bullets, then if it is simplified, it is shed on the water, and if it gathered.This is invalid for Jahin: The first: that searching for the causes of water and the air, such as searching for the causes of the earth.The second: Why did that side become from the earth, simplified until he stood on the water and became this side, fierce?And the third of it: those who said: The analogy of the earth is attracted to the ark for it from all sides, so it was not attracted to some of the sides of some of the first, so it remained in the middle.This is a falsehood for Jahin: The first: that the minority is ahead of the greatest attraction, as the atom does not be attracted to the ark.The second: The relatives are attracted by the attraction.And the sequence of it: the saying of those who made it because it will be paid by the ark for it from All the sides, as if it is made of the dust in a duct and then the sink was ran on its powerful administration, then it stands for the dust in the stretch of the bond of the bid The sides.This is also false from five faces: the first: the payment if it is reached in power to this limit, so why does the one not feel from us?.The second: What is this payment does not make the movement of clouds and winds to a side with its eyes.The third: He did not make it resigned to the Wester The lord: It is necessary for the fruit the whenever (P-95) is the greatest that its movement will be slowed down; Because the greatest rush of the picnic is slowed down from the smallest impulsion.Fifth: It is necessary to be the movement of the ritual from the rituals of the time.Because it is a distance from the ark.Fifth: that the land with the nature is asking for the stretch of the ark, and it is the saying of the Esatatal and its phrase followed, and this is also weak; Because the bodies are equal in generosity, then some of the descriptions that are required for the sake of which are required that this situation must be permissible, so that it is permissible, so it is possible.And its sixth: Abu Hashem said: The descending half is from the ground in which there are difficult brokers, and the highest half in it is in it, so the defending of the Auddaman is obligatory.The question is: that each one of the two classes is made with a special description that can only be with the deceased.She fixed what we mentioned that the earth would be only from God Almighty.And when we say: Look at the earth to know that it is stable without a relationship above it, or a downtown under it, but that it is not a relationship, and it is on the authority of it.Aid to a relationship that the relationship needed for another relationship, not to an end, and in this direction, it was proven that there is no one under it, so we know that there is no need And his choice, and this is why God Almighty said: God holds the heavens and the earth to be overpowered and if they are still holding them from one of him [Fatir: 41].The second condition in the land of the land is a butter of us: that it is not in the end of the crucifixion like the stone, for the sleep and the walk is from what is suffering from the body, and it is the same For example, the urbanization of it is not possible for it, and the father could not take it from it to be excused and installed as it is intended; And that it is not in the end of the softness, such as the water in which the man is divided.The third condition: not to be in the end of the kindness and the vicious; The lips are not limited to the light on it, and what was like that is that it is not dirty of the makers and the sun, so he would have cooled very much, so he made God, so that God is the same.The light is upon him, so he will be a butterfly to be a butterfly.The loyal condition: to be Water ritual; Because the elaboration of the earth is to be cloudy in the water, then the seas should be surrounded by the earth, and if it were like that, it would not have been a butter of us Some of its sides were brought out of the water, such as the wilderness, until it was reconciled to be a butterfly for us.It is among those who claimed that the condition in the land of the land is a butterfly that it is not a hatred, and this verse inferred that the land is not a ka, and this is very long; Because the karat, if it is great, the piece is like a flat, in the place of the restriction on it, and whom it increases, decides that the mountains are the bond of land, then the land is then the land, then the land is then the land, then it is possible.This is the first, and God knows.* * * The fifth question: in the paths of the ends of the earth and its attributes: the first benefit: the things that are born in them from the hostility, the plants, the animal and the high effects, the lifeline, the lifeline, the lifeline, the flaw Discriminate it except God Almighty.The second: that the wet is dumped with it, and the touches will be obtained in the beginning of the crimes.Third: Divide the ground, and there is a soft earth, crucifixion, sand, satellite, and freedom, (P-96), which is the saying of the high: and in the land, the stroke of the righteous: 4] Al -Tayyib comes out of his plants with the permission of his Lord, who is a sin that does not come out except to confirm [Al -A'raf: 58].Function: Classion of its colors; So Hamar, Abyad, Aswid, and my eye, and dust, on what he said: And from the mountains is a new white and red red, its colors, and the bonds of black [Fattar: 27].Fifth: Creativity in the brightness.Sixth: It is a treasurer for the sky that descends from the sky, and the signal has the Almighty saying: And we descended from the sky with water, so we have been in the land, so we will be in the land, and it is in the land of the land, and it is in the land.[The Believers: 18], and his saying: Say: Do you see that if your water is in a glory, then whoever brings you with a certain water [King: 30].The seven: the eyes and the righteousness in which the sign is in it, and the signal is by saying: He made it in it as a ritual and a flower [thunder: 3].The eighth: What is in it from the dimensions and the weights, and the signal is the Almighty saying: The land is its peer and we met with it in it, and we have wiped out in it from everything.[19] After that, the Bayan was complete, and he said: And there is nothing for us except for our shame and what we descend except with a known amount.The ninth: the hideout that the land comes out of love and nuclei, he said: God is the grace and the nucleus [Al -Anam: 95], and he said: The hideout is brought out in the heavens and the earth [ant: 25].Then, the land has the rituals of the generosity, because you pay a single love for it, and it will return it to you a seventh of the seventh of the seventh of the seventh of the seventh of the seventh of the sons of the [Al -Baqara: 261].Liberal: her life after her death; He said: I did not see that the water of the water to the earth is the stitching, so we will come out with it.[Al -Sajdah: 27] And he said: And a hay have a dead earth, which we will live and bring us out of love, so whoever eats [Yass: 33],.Hadiyah is ten: What is on the different animals of the colors, the pictures and the creation, and the signal has its saying: the creation of the heavens, without the intention of it, It was broadcast in it from every bear [Luqman: 10].The second is ten: What is in the different plants is its colors, types and benefits, and the signal has its saying: and we have proposed to us from every marriage with a fool [Q.7] It is a sign, and the disagreement of its stabbing is a sign, and the disagreement of its narrators is a sign, so the strength of the humanity, and from it the strength of the Bahas, as he said: Eat and see you: [54] Bosurus, including food, among them is asleep, and from the medicine, and from the fruits, and among them is the different types of sweetness and oath.He said: It was estimated that its forces were estimated in four days, whether for the families [Chapter: 10], and also from the east of humanity; Because the eclipse is either a vegetarian, which is the cotton and the cordon, or the animal, which is poetry, wool, the graying, and the rituals, and it is one of the animals that God has broadcast in the land, And the albusted from the earth.Then he said: It creates what you do not know [Al -Nahl: 8] in which there is a sign of many benefits that only God knows.(P-97) Then he gave it to him and the exalted, making the earth a souve for your elders after your death, so he said: Did we not make the earth a coffin and mothers [Al-Mursalat: 25, 26].From it, we created you and in it, and then you will be gathered by it and the exalted of these great benefits for the sky and the earth, and he said: He mocked you in the heavens: The third is ten: What is in the different stones in it, in its young people, it is suitable for the adultery, so it will make its thieves to the seeds, and in its adults, it is not taken to the sons, so it is taken to the sons, The stone that removes the fire from it with its many, and look at the ruby ​​of the red with its pride.Then look at the multiplicity of the benefit with that bastard, and the lack of benefit with this frankness.The four -year -old: What God has called for the mourning of the mourning, such as gold and silver, and then contemplated, then the human beings are brought up.And they removed the fish from the sea of ​​the sea, and they were brought up from the whims of the air, then they were rewarded for finding gold and silver, and the reason for it is that there is no abundance in it, This is a good thing that only comes with pride, so the one who is able to find them is invalidated by this wisdom, so that God is the one who has a chapter, the chapter of the back of the And a promise to this grace, and that is what is not harmful to creation in it, enabled them to be able to make them enabled from the semi -shabby, and that is from the grace, The sane person in this kind The miracles were forced in the agitation of these tanks to a wise, male, knowledgeable, and granted, and the Almighty who says the oppressors are great.Fifth is twenty: a lot of what is found on the mountains and lands from the trees that reconcile for the children and the water, then the widow.And what is more needed for bread and cooking.God has alerted to the evidence of the earth and its benefits with the conservation that is not informed of the rhetoric, and the eloquence is miraculous, and he said: It is the one who extended the land and made it and made it.He made two wives in it [Al -Raad: 3], and the rivers are great, such as Nill, Sahitan, Jahon, and Furat, and among the young, and it is a lot, and all of them are all.And the cultivation and the bridges of the benefits.* * * The sixth question: that the sky is better than the mother of the earth?Some of them said: Heaven is better; Lojoh: One of it: The sky is the worshiper of the angels, and there is no seat in which God disobeyed one.And secondly: When Adam - peace be upon him - came in paradise with that disobedience, he was told: He is tied to Heaven, and God Almighty said: He does not dwell in my neighborhood.And the third of it: His Excellency said: We made the sky a futile stance [Al -Anbiya: 32], and his saying: Your confusion, which made you in the sky with a zoo [Al -Furqan: 61], and he did not remember that.And the one that is more important: that in the most important thing, the remembrance of the sky is presented to the earth.Others said: Rather, the earth is better.For his sake: “A” is that he is a lifetime of the land of the land with the blessing of his saying: The first house is placed for people to those who are blessed with a blessed blessing [Al -Imran] The tree [Al -Qasas: 30], “C” to the Aqsa Mosque, who has blessed us around it [Al -Israa: 1], “D” and described the land of the Levant with the blessing, and he said: “The earth’s ritual and the rituals of it.” Fifth: He described the ranks of the earth with the blessing, and he said: Say: You will atone for atonement [Chapter: 9], to his saying: He made it in it, from it, and it is in it.[10] If it was said: What is the blessing in the empty -walled vandals and the deadly convergence?We said: It is a place for the savage and its pursuit, then it is a place for people if they need it, for this is the righteous, the Almighty said: And in the land there are verses for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is He has the right to other people who are certain, but when he did not benefit from them except those who are persons who made them verses for those who are certain, to whom they (P-98) he said: “He said:“ Hoda ”.[2] And its sixth: that it was groaned and the Almighty created the honorable people from the earth on what he said: From it, we created you and in it, we are returning it [Taha: 55], and he did not create from the heavens: The sky is a futile stood [Al -Anbiya: 32].And the sake of it: that God Almighty has honored his Prophet with it, so he made the earth all of them as a mosque for him and made it analogy.* * * As for saying: (Heaven is based on), he has questions: The first question: It is the highest of the heavens and the earth in his book in the positions, and there is no doubt that the multiplication of the remembrance of God is the highest of the heavens and the earth, and the earth is on the authority of God.He has his grace and exalted in them, with great secrets and wisdom in a language that does not reach the understanding of creation or their minds.The second question: in the dignity of the sky, and it is from the faces: the first: that God Almighty decorated it with seven things, with the injustice, and we have decorated the sky with the dungeon, with the dungeon, and the king of the king: The moon has a light [Noah: 16], and by the sun and made the sun a larva [Noah: 16], and by the throne, the Lord of the Great Throne [Tawbah: 129], and the Persian and the softening of the cherry [ 255] And, and in the way in a wiped outhis [Al -Buruj: 22], and in the pen and the pen [pen: 1], this is seven: three of them are an apparent, and four hidden fad The hearing of verses and news.The second: It is the highest heavens with the heavens that indicate the greatness of its affairs: a sky, a fugitive and seven aspects, and seven as an increase.Then he mentioned the punishment of her matter and said: If the sky is wrapped [the messengers: 9], and if the sky is stirred [Al -Takwir: 11], the day of the sky [Al -Anbiya: 104], on the day of the heavens: 8] The day of the sky is a light [Al -Tor: 9], so it was a response like the delicacy [Rahman: 37], and he mentioned its principle in two verses, and he said: Then he went to the sky, and it is a smile: Those who disbelieved that the heavens and the earth were ritual, so we met them [the prophets: 30], so this exclusion is the intensity They created them for a ruling on the language of what he said: We did not create the sky and the earth and what was between them is void, that thought those who disbelieved [p.27].And the third: that the Heavens made the sky before the supplication: the performance is raised to it, and the faces are directed at the same, and it is the horse of the lights, the place of the righteous, the sake of the righteous, the sake of the righteous, the sake of the righteous, the sake of the righteous, the light of the sake, the sake of the righteous, the light of the sake, the sake of the righteous, the luminous, the light, and the light, Corruption.Al -Rabaa: Some of them said: The heavens and the lands on two grades, for the heavens are influential, and it is not affected.The land is impressive, not influenced and influential is honored by the capable, for this reason is the remembrance of the heavens on the ground in the largest, and also in the most frequently mentioned in the most.With the memorial of the collection, and the earth with the same memorial, for it is necessary for many heavens to obtain the different communication of the different communities A metaphor, so the one earth was sufficient.Fifth: You think about the color of the sky and the correctness of the tanner The eye of the eye was affected by the look of the parking, so he looked at how God made the Almighty (P-99) the sky with this color of the cherry, Let the sight of the eyes benefit from it, so it is his pursuit and the exaltation of its colors, the colors, which are the enlightened, and the form of it, the best of the forms, and it is the one who said: They looked at the sky, according to them, how are her children and decorated it and what it had of the eras [s: 6] means the chapters in it, and if it was a bishop, it was not the same.* * * The third question: in the Bayan al -Fadl ’Heaven and the Bayan al -Fadlu al -Muhafil in it, which is the sun, the moon, and the stars: the sun is thought of its rituals, and it is not.The whole world is the whole world, so how people would have been in their standards, and then the one who is in the sun is a back People have a guidance, and there is no decision with their confusion to the guidance and decision to obtain comfort and the distraction The night for you to be dwell in it and the day is insightful [Yunus: 67], and also, if not the stranger, the hasty would bear them on the perpetuation of the work on what he said: He said: And the day made us a pension [Al -Naba: 10, 11] and the third: If not for the stranger, the earth would be greeted by the sunrise of the sun until it would be blessed by all of them, and it is from it, On what he said: Did you not see to your Lord how to extend the shadow, even if he wanted him to make him a hook [Al -Furqan: 45], and the sun became with the ruling of the truth, and they will be in the ruling, A larger is paid to the people of a house with the destruction of their need, then it is raised from them to settle and rest What is in the world of the world, this is all in the sun and its stranger.As for the rushing of the sun and its decline, God has made it a reason for the establishment of the four chapters: in the winter, the horger in the tree and the plants are lukewarm, so the materials of the materials will take over.The air and the multiplication of clouds and the rain, and the eternity of the tallness strengthens the gravity of the cruel in the country.In the rabid, the medicine moves, and the materials are appeared in the winter, so the plants are called, the trees are enlightened, and the acne is enlightened for the chains.In the fast, the air is raised, so the fruits are ripened, the grace of the eternity is dissolved, the face of the earth dries, and it ends up for children and the buildings.In the Kharif, the dress appears and the cold appears, so the eternity will decrease a little to the winter, for if the decree is a single payment, then the feet were destroyed and spoiled.As for the candle, it is contemplated in its benefits, so if it was standing in one position, one of the lambs would not be treated in that place, and it was struggled in the place, and the parking is in the way, But it is upset at the beginning of the day from the past It is still going on and fading after one side until it ends up to the stranger, and it is shining on the honest side, so it does not remain a place that is not a place The sun was sunny, as if God Almighty says: If you stopped at the side of the honesty and the rich, he raised his building on the Kuwait of the Fakr, so he would not reach the noble.He says: If the rich prevented him from the light of the sun, then I run the ark and turn it on it until the poor takes its share.As for the benefits of its inclination in its movement from the line of leveling, then he said: If the makers would not have a movement in the inclination, then the effect was made by the same The sides are free from the benefits that occurred from it and the one who was close to it was the same, and the power was there for a single way, so if it is hot, then it is hot All of them are to the fire and did not form the generators, so the position is adjacent to the passenger of the wives on an entity, and the line of what is not adjacent to it is on how to be a scourge (P-100) (P-100) Average between them on an intermediate entity, and it is in a permanent position in which it will be in which the air and the sacrifice will be, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the last one, and in the other place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the last place, and in the last one, and in the other place, and in the other place, and in the other place, Another position is a luminous or a difference in which there is no maturity, even if it was not diligent, and the crocodiles were fierce, and it was a little, and it was a little.The impact is the excessive excess, and it was presenting a closeness from what was not a mile, and if the makers were the speed of a move from this, then the folded of the benefits was not The movement is kept on a period of time, then it moves to another side of the need for the need and remains on each side of the righteousness of the forever that is done with that Its benefit, the Glory of the Creator, the Creator, the Creator, the Great Wise, and the Understanding Fate.This is, but the moon, which is called the night of the night: know that he was groaning and the exalted, he made his outlook and his absences, and he made his rituals in the time of the time, Reconciliation, as for his stranger, he has a benefit for those who raised from his enemy, so the night will be hidden by him, so he does not have a student, so he will be saved, and if he does not have the darkness.The enemy, which is intended from the saying of the delegate: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The darkness was hidden and the moon appeared.Among the stories: that an Arab who slept from his sentences for a night, then he lost it, and when the moon came up and found it, then he looked at the moon and said: God has made you and enlightened you, We enlighten you, and if he wants to turn you, I do not know more, I ask him for you, and if you guided me to my pleasure, God has given you a light, then I will say: A short ؎ If I say: I am still going out, then you are such ∗∗∗ or I said: Your lord is my Lord, so he has done it and it was in the Arabs who gave the moon and says: The moon is close to the sacrifice The rough is rubbed, the lover is destroyed, the cuisine is tired, the young men will be packed, the remembrance of the loved ones, and the debt is brought to the debt.They were also in them who preferred the moon on the sun of its face For the name of the sun is a defect ∗∗∗ nor the memory is a pride for the core and the second: that they said: the moon, so they made the sun a lord of the moon.And among them is those who preferred the sun over the moon that God Almighty presented it to the moon in his saying: the sun and the moon with a compass The argument is exhibited with his saying: From you a disbeliever and you are a believer [Al -Tajaban: 2], and he said: The people of the fire and the companions of the paradise are not equal to the heaven [Al -Hashr: 20], and he said: He was created: The hardship is easy [Al -Sharh: 6], and he said: Some of them are unjust [Fatir: 32], the verse.As for the stars: it has a benefits: the first benefit: its color is a wardrobe for the people, and the second: the kiss of the kiss with it, and the third: that he is guided by it Hope: It is the one who made you the stars to guide them in the darkness of righteousness and sea [Al -Anam: 97].Then the stars are on three sections: Ghariba, not to be informed, like the southern heights, and a lord that is not strange, such as the namalum, and from what is strange and the one who is lost, and the one who comes from it The constants, including cars, and from them, are ancient, and there are strange, and the words are long.As for the one who claims to be a nose from the customs of the boundaries and the dimensions: (P-101) ؎ Fear from you a sea in which the chain of transmission has been lost.A messenger [Al -Jin: 26], and he said: What you have been given from science is only a few [Al -Israa: 85], and he said: I do not say to you with the Khazis of God, and I do not know the unseen [Hood: 31], and he said: The same [Al -Kahf: 51], so the creation of the knowledge of their own and their attributes, so how do they appreciate the knowledge of the distance of them, and the distance of them, and the distance The knowledge of the truths know that.The pilgrims of the good, what God is a good * * * * The sky is marvelous like a stall, the earth is like a rug, and the stars are enlightened like the injured, and the human being like the owner of the house that is shrouded in it, and the veil of the plant For its benefits and the tales of the tales, it is tested in its reconciliation, so this is a clear sentence indicating that the world is created with a complete mob.However, he is aware, and God knows.As for his words, he said: He descended from the sky with water, so he brought him out of the fruits as a liveli And his children, then God knows the types of their needs; As if he said: O Adam, I do not marry you to anything other than this, which is for you as the mother, and he said: We have poured water in the morning, then we are the earth of the earth, and the righteous: The dearest things with you are gold and silver, and if I created the earth from gold and silver, was it from these benefits from them, then I have made these things in these things.It is a prisoner, so how is the situation in paradise, so the one who gets the land is your mother, but it is more accompanied by the mother; Because the mother keeps you a single color of milk, and the earth feeds you like that, and so on from the blame, then he said: From it we created you and in it, we will return to you [55] This mother, and this is not a return; Because the woman is not promised to his mother, and that is because your place is from the mother who gave you a sake of your place from the earth, then you were in the stomach of the mother Thirst, so how if you enter the old mother of the mother, but the condition is that the stomach of this is the oldest mother, as you were in the stomach of the young mother; Because when you were in the stomach of the young mother, you would not have been for you, for you are a great way for you to be great So you came out to the heads of obedience from you to your Lord, and today they invite you seventy times to prayer, so do not answer it with your man.And know that he was glorified and exalted when he mentioned the earth and the sky between what is between them from the similarities From the animal, and from the types of garments is a liveli And it creates it except for those who were contrary to it in the self and the adjectives, and that is the wise and the glorified and exalted.We are asking: (P-102) The first question: Do you say: God is the Almighty is the Creator of these fruits, the wise of the water to it in the course of the habit, or the one who is in the way of the habit, Water is a matter of influential, and in the land, it is metable, so if they are gathered, the effects of that power that God created is created?The answer: There is no doubt that both sayings must be wise.As for detailing, it is said: There is no doubt that it is an exalted person who is able to create these fruits as a result.It is not possible for these bombers because the fruit has no meaning except a body with which it is bored, a shouting color and a wet, and the body is subject to this characteristic, and this is the end of this.God has a high level; Because the correction of the al -Muqdoriyya is either the impermissibility, or the possibility, or they are.And on the ability, it is necessary for God to be an exalted man who created these symptoms in the body, as a result of these mediators, and what is confirmed by this.The transmitted evidence is what the news is that it is a transcendence that seduces the nakedness of the people of paradise for those who are rewarded, without these lines, except that we say: I will not say: It was destined for it by the midst of the creation of these influential powers and the ability in the bodies, and the appearance of the words of the late ones from the speaking of the denial of that, and the denial of that.The second question: When it was able to create these fruits with the eyes of these mediums, then the wisdom is in its creation with this mediator in this period of time?The answer: God does what he gives and governs what he wants.Then they reminded of the detailed judgment: one of them: that it is exalted, but it was done by the habit that this only does it on the formation and treasure; Because the costs, if you bear the hardship in the plow and the gears, is a request for the fruits and they have been himself, after that, then they knew that when they needed, they needed to carry this To ask for this worldly minimum, to carry the hardships less than the worldly hardships to seek the other benefits that are the greatest The world was the first, and this became as we said that it was an exalted person to the creation of healing from other than the medication, but he was hateful with his eagerness; Because if the paths of the medicine are borne in payment of the harm of the disease, then the hardship of the slander will be buried in payment of the harm of the punishment, it was the first.And secondly: It is up to the one who created it as a payment of this mediator, so the fierce science obtained its chain of transmission to the wise Qadir, and that is like the opponent.As for if he created it with these mediators, then the cost is determined in its chain of transmission to the Qadir to a precise look and a mysterious thought, so the reward is not, and the reward is that Were it not for the reasons, I would not be suspended.And the third of it: that perhaps the angels and the people of the vision have a cross in that and correct ideas.The third question: Its saying: It was descended from the sky with water that requires the rain of the rain from the sky, and the matter is not like that; The rains are generated from the car of the earth and it is raised from the cold layer of the air, so there is there with the causes of the cold The rain.The answer is from faces: one of it: that the sky was called a sky of its heavens, so all what he called is a sky, so if it comes down from the clouds He came down from the sky.And the second: that the movement of the excitement of these moisture parts is from the depth of the earth, the wet parts, and the sky has descended from the sky.And the third of it: that the saying of God is the righteousness, and I have been told that it is an upholstery that is sent down from the rain from the sky, so if we know that it is with that, it will be descended from the clouds, then it is the one who says: The clouds, and from the clouds to the ground.The fourth question: what is meaning “from” in its saying: from the thukewers.The answer is in it: The sky is some water, so we brought it out of it, some of the thunderbolts, so that some of your livelihoods will be.The second: to be for the patience, as your saying: I spent the duties (P-103) spending.If it was said: What did he do (livelihood)?We said: If it was (from) to the metaphor, it would have been infected with it.And if it is clear, it was effective for (delay).The fifth question: The fruit that comes out with the sky of the sky is a lot, so it was said: (the fruits) without the fruit or the fruits?Answer: Alert it to the few worlds of worldly and a sense of the greatness of the last, and God knows best.As for the saying of the Exalted: Do not make it to God and you know that it has questions.The first question: What did his saying comment: Do not make?The answer is in it three aspects: one of them: to be attached to the matter, that is, worship, do not make it to God.The origin of worship and the basis of its neutrality.And the second: (perhaps), and the meaning created you for you to fear and fear his punishment, so do not prove a peer for him, for it is one of the greatest duties of punishment.And the third of it: with his saying: The one who made you a bed for you, that is, he who created for you, this brilliant indication, so do not take parties.The second question: What is the peer?The answer: It is the likeness of the righteous, and the man denounced it: I passed it off, from the sympathy of a denomination: if he escaped, as if each one of the denominations is calling his owner, that is, he turns away.If it was said: They did not say: idols are disputed by God.We said: When they worshiped it and named it, the gods were likened to the condition of those who believe that it is the gods who are able to be destroy By the memorization of the peer, they were subjected to them that they made a lot Land).* * * The third question: What is the meaning and you know?Answer: It is meaning that you have the money of your minds.You know that these things are not correct.Be honest.Here are the questions: the first question: know that there is no one in the world that is proven to God a partner who equals him in existence, power and knowledge And the rule, and this is what is not yet found, but the tricks are proven to be a circumstance, one of them: a dream that does good, and the second: its sorry.As for taking a slave, except God, the exalted in the gates to this is a lot, the first team: the servant of the makers, and they are the Sabeans, so they say: God is the one who created this.This is the wips are the wives of this world.And the second parties: Christians who worship the Christ, peace be upon him.And the third parting: the slave of the ethn.And know that there is no religion from the religion of the slave of the one, and that is because the forefront of the prophets who are transferred to us is a Noah - peace be upon him - which is what came to them God Almighty told his people in his saying: And they said: Do not be distressed by your family, and do not distract from friendliness, no unknown, and do not go and disable and ease [Noah: 23] so he did this.Before Noah - peace be upon him - and it remains until now, but rather the people of the world are dominated by this article.Religion and the gold, which is a matter of which is to be in terms of being known as his corruption with the harm, but the knowledge is that this stone is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the wickedness He created me and created the heavens and the earth is a fierce knowledge, so the kindness of the great gathering over it, so it is obligatory to be for the slave of the second, and it is the same as the sake They mentioned it in it: (P-104) One of them: What was mentioned by Abu Ja`far ibn Muhammad al-Mujahm al-Bakhi in some of his artifacts is that there was a lot of people from the family They say to God and his angels, and they believe that God is the Head of Jesus and a picture, as well as the best of the pictures, and so is the state of the angels, and also in the good They have been answered by the sky, and that they must be disturbed by the style of the angry of the theorist, the good of the narration of the authority that they were excluded from the authority, So they will be satisfied with its worshipers, who are intended to ask the zipper to God Almighty and his angels, for if it is true what the father mentioned is the one, then the causes in the worship of the first.And the second: What was mentioned by the most of the scholars, which is that people have seen the changes of this world, with the changes of the conditions The heads create the different chapters and the adopted conditions.In the longing of people, when they believed in that, they were glorified in their glorification.It is created for God The greatest, but it is an immortal for this world, for the first is the most considered that it is the god in the truth and the second separation: that it is the mediators between God Almighty and between the good With her worshipers, and she was subjected to her, then when they saw the curtains, they were buried in the most abusive of the eyes of the sight, they took it as idols and accepted the worshipers of your worshipers.The high aspirations, and those who are close to its absent phases, then when the period took place, they were overwhelmed by the male of the wives, and they were stripped of the worshipers of that fertilizer, so that the worst, so the one in the way of Waked.And the third of it: that the rulings of the rulings were appointed by the seizures in the two years, the one and the two thousands, and they claim that those who take a smile in this time are the same He intends for it in the conditions of the one who is happy, and the pest pays, and if they took that smile, they would be borne, so they will be lost, so they would not be able to do so In that majestic, it became like worship, and when the time of that verb was touched, they forgot the principle of the matter and used to worship it on the ignorance of the matter.And he paid it: Whenever a great man dies from them, they are in which they are in which he was answered by the prayer and the acceptance of the rush, when God Almighty took upon him, and they will be blessed.He agreed that this human being is an enclosure for them on the Day of Resurrection with God Almighty on what God has informed of this article in this article in his saying: Fifth: Perhaps they took it as a meter for their prayers and their obedience and they prostrate to it, not for it, as we are glorified until the kiss, not for the kiss, and it is not for the kiss, and it is not the same.The ignorance of the people is that it is obligatory.And its sixth: Perhaps they were from the embodiment, so they met the permissibility of the solutions of the Lord in it, and they worshiped it on this interpretation.This is the faces that can be carried by this article on it until it becomes in terms of where it is known for the harm of the mind.* * * (P-105) Will the worship of the Enta?The answer: We said: It is upset, but he alerted to the earth and the heavens are created by what we have shown that the earth and the sky are shaken by the brooms of the bodies in the body, and there is no One of them with what he has sealed with forms, adjectives, and news with special specialization, and indicated that this is the special, if he was a body, he would not be able to do so, he is also to the one who is not, so he is also to the one who is not.Be a body.If this is proven, then we say: As for the saying of those who went to the worship of the two by building the suspicion of the suspicion, then when we showed this significance on the negation of the one who said.As for the second saying, [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection
