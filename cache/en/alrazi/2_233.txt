The second Quranic researcher is ten days in breastfeeding and parents, their children are breastfed for two full ones for those who wanted to be breastfed and on the authority of the mother, and they have a loyalty to him With the known, it does not cost a soul except its capacity, and it is not harmed, and the mother is in her son, nor is he born in his son, and on the heir, like that, then if they want to be a separation from them On them, his saying is up to them: and the parents are breastfed by their children for two full ones for those who wanted to fulfill breastfeeding and on the lord, and it is not a good.It costs a soul, except for its capacity, and it is not harmed, and the mother is in her son, nor is he born in his son, and on the heir, like that, if they want a separation from their kindness, then it is for them.Know that in his words, the Exalted: The parents are three sayings: The first: that what is meant by him is what I feel the appearance of the memorizers, and he is all the parents, whether it is a warden or a divorce The memorization is general, and the evidence of the specialization was established, so it is obligatory to leave it on its general.Jahan: One of them: that God is the Almighty mentioned this verse, the verse of divorce, so this verse was fulfilled by these verses, and the reason for the repetition is between Before her, if the difference is obtained, hateful and habitor will get hated, and so he carries the woman to harm the child from two faces: one of them: that the abuse of the child joins the time.The second: that it may be desirable to marry another husband, and that requires its feet on the tire of the matter The divorcees of the sponsorship of the side of the kindness and the completeness of their affairs, so he said: The parents are browning their children and the absolute intended.The second pilgrimage to them: what the Saddi mentioned, he said: What is meant by the divorced states; Because God Almighty said after this verse: And on the loyalty to Him, they have their livelihood and their crusts, and if the husband was the rest of the obligatory, it is obligatory Al -Zuwajiya, not for the sake of breastfeeding, and know that it is possible to answer the first pilgrimage that this verse is a disgrace to the ruling of its independence, and it is not.Before her, and from the second pilgrimage, it is not possible for the woman to be entitled to the amount of money, because of the wives and another amount of breastfeeding, for there is no contradiction.The third saying: The one said in “Al -Bassit”: The first is to be carried on the zooms in the event of the marriage of marriage; Because the divorced woman does not deserve the eclipse, but rather the reward.If it is said: If you are the remains, it is the right of the agreement and the fracture due to the marriage, whether it is raised, or if it is breastfed, then the face of this is the face of this The investigator With breastfeeding.We said: The agreement and the fracture are in the metaphor of the accommodation, so if it is occupied by the custody and the breastfeeding, the generosity of the husband is not free, so it is a matter Its wonders and its crucifixion is broken down by the shift in the servant of the husband, so God cut off that illusion with the affirmation of the sustenance and the eclipse.This is all the words of the one, may God have mercy on him.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: they are browning their children, and they have two questions: the first question: this is the words, even if it is in the memorial, except that it is in the meaning, but it is a matter of it, but it is a matter.The first: the estimation of the verse: and the parents are breastfed by their children in the ruling of God, which he answered, except that he is deleted to the path of speech on him.The second: that it is a meaning to be broken: to be broken, except that it is deleted for that in the words of the passion.The second question: This matter is not a positive matter, and it is indicated by Jahan: The first: the words of the Almighty: if you are laid down, then you will come to them: Breastfeeding when you deserve the rent.And the second: that he said after that: If you are sorry, you will be breastfed for him.The birth has their livelihood and their crops, and the mother may be divorced, and it was not a garment on the father, except by the reason It is not necessary for it, and in which the search that we presented, if it proves that breastfeeding is not obligatory for the mother, then this matter is submitted to the scarf from the time He reconciled to him from the brightest of the milk, and from where the mother’s companionship is upon him, I will complete the success of others.Or, the ritual is only breastfed by it, so it is obligatory for it when it is subjected to breastfeeding it as it is obligatory for every one who is obligated to the food.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: two of two are full, and it has angios: the first question: the origin of the one who is in the case of the thing is: if it is converted, then the one who turns is from the first The second, but the kinship was mentioned to raise the delusion that it is like their saying: Falan was established so that there are no two years or two months, but he raised the one, but he stayed, اليَوْمُ يَوْمانِ مُذْ لَمْ أرَهُ, وإنَّما يَعْنُونَ يَوْمًا وبَعْضَ اليَوْمِ الآخَرِ.* * * When this completion was suspended with our will, it was proven that this completion is not obligatory.The second: He is upset, he said: If they wanted to be separated from them, they will not be disturb The intended is not the same as the positive of this approach, but in it there are faces: the first, which is the most correct: that the intended from it is the cut of the dispute from the time The period of breastfeeding, so God appreciated that in the past until he brought him to him when the conflict falls between them, so if the father wants to heal, and the one who has been blessed, and the one who has been blessed, and the one who has been blessed, and the one who has been blessed.He did not have it, and so if he was on the contrary, but if they were gathered on the authority of the boy before the fullness of the two years, then they have this.The second direction: In the intended one of this challenge is that breastfeeding has a special judgment in the project, and it is his saying ﷺ: Determination is that the humility did not happen in this time, it is not beneficial to this judgment, this is the view of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, and he is the saying of Ali and my son Ibn Umar, Al -Aqamah, Al -Sha’abi, and Al -Zahri, may God be pleased with them, said Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him: The period of breastfeeding is three months.The argument of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, is from his faces: the first pilgrimage: that it is not intended from his saying: Whoever wants to be breastfed is the one who does not do the authority of the authority; For it is known that the boy is asking me about milk at the time of the two years, so he needed it after the two years for a weakness.Because the children are varying in that, and if it is not permissible for what is intended to be done by this meaning, it is necessary to be the one who is the ruling on the one who is suspended, The estimation expresses the verse indicating that the rule of breastfeeding does not prove except when the breastfeeding is established in this period.The second pilgrimage: It was narrated from Ali, may God be pleased with him, that he ﷺ said: “There is no breastfeeding after a break.” The third pilgrimage: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, narrated that he ﷺ said: ““ He does not forbid breastfeeding except what was in the two years.” The third face: In the intended from this definition, what was narrated from Ibn Abbas is that he said to the one who puts the most famous: it is breastfed, so that you are breastfed.For the seventh months, three months and twelve months, and others said: Powers (P-102) is the limit in the breastfeeding of every birth, and the Hajj of Ibn Abbas He said: And he carried it and his separation of three months [Al -Ahqaf: 15] This verse indicated that the time of these two states is this destiny of time, and it has increased in one of the state The last case.* * * The third question: It was narrated that a man came to me, may God be pleased with him.May God be pleased with him: God said: And his pregnancy and his separation Thirty months [Al -Ahqaf: 15] And the Almighty said: The parents are breastfed by their children for two full ones, so the bears are six months, the boy is your son, and for the age of life For a famous, and he walked in its custody, and Ibn Abbas said: If I have been entrusted with the writing of God, I will detest you Moreover.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Whoever wants to breastfeed, in his two questions: the first question: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, read: “Breastfeeding” is broken.The second question: In how this verse is connected to what is before it and Jahan: the first: that the estimation of the verse: this judgment is for those who wanted to complete the breastfeeding, and the breast About two completes, then the ease and the slightness descended and said: Whoever wanted to be breastfeed, and the meaning is that he is the perpetrator of the deficiency with the remembrance of this.The second: that the mother is attached to his saying: they are broken as you say: I put it in a sole of his son, that is, they are brown around for those who want to those who want to those who want Because the father must breastfeed the child without the mother, because of what he has shown.* * * As for his saying, the Almighty: And on the loyalty to him, their livelihoods and their crusts with the well -known, so he has the books: the first question: the mother is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the mother, but he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the mother, but he is the one who is the mother The name is Wajoh: The first: The owner of the “scout” said: The reason is that it is known that the parents are the children For the sake of Ibn Al -Rasheed: ؎ Rather, the mothers of the people are aware of the dumps, and the parents are the seconds of مَوْلُودًا عَلى فِراشِهِ عَلى ما قالَ ﷺ: ”"الوَلَدُ لِلْفِراشِ" “, فَكَأنَّهُ قالَ: إذا ولَدَتِ المَرْأةُ الوَلَدَ لِلرَّجُلِ وعَلى فِراشِهِ, وجَبَ عَلَيْهِ رِعايَةُ مَصالِحِهِ, فَهَذا Alert it to the lineage and attachment to this destiny.The third: It was said in the interpretation of his saying: The son of a mother [Taha: 94] said that what is meant by him is that the mother is accompanied by the child, so the excess of the remembrance of the mother was the remembrance of the mother.Here, the father mentioned the words of the loyal to him, alert him that this father was born to the father of the father, so he was shortened to him, and he is a long time for him, and he is a porridge of him It was said: a word for you, and a word to you.* * * Until you are able to spoil the salt of the chapter, so he commanded it with its livelihood and its crops with the well -known, and what is known in this section may be the same It will be otherwise, only from the side of the knowledge; Because if he did what is enough for it Its food and its crushing, so I used the fate of the wage, because it (P-103) was less than the destiny of sufficiency because of its right to hunger and the nudity, so it is a good.* * * The third question: that the mother will command the mother with the sponsorship of the child first, then the father commanded his pursuit secondly, and this indicates that the contemporary of the righteousness to the patronage of the mother to the one who is more than the one who is more Father's patronage; Because it is not between the righteousness and between the patronage of the mother and the mediator of the bit.With the hypocrisy and the fracture, and that indicates that the right of the mother is more than the right of the father, and the preserved news is for this meaning that is a most popular.* * * Then the Almighty said: It does not cost a soul except its capacity and in which there are issues: the first question: the mandate: the obligation, it is said: the assignment of the matter is the one who is responsible for it, and it is not.The cost, which is the effect on the direction of the blackness, is the meaning of the cost of the matter: he strived to show in it his effect, and he wrapped it: his obligation is what he appears in it, and the effect of it is the effect of the person, Take it, from the capacity of the king, that is, the offer, and if it was narrowed, it was incapable of it, and the capacity of the power of power, then it was said: The expansion is above the energy.The second question: What is meant by the verse is that the father of this boy does not cost to spend on him and on his mother, unless his ability can expand him; Because the expansion in the language does not accommodate the ability, and does not reach the expansion of it, and he indicated that the father is required only, and it is the counterpart of his saying in the surah of the one who is the one who is in the surah of the ritual So they came to them [Divorce: 6] Then he said: If you are miserable, then the last of it is breastfed for him [Divorce: 6] Then he explained in the horizon that it is on the authority of the man of the man of the man: He has a capacity of his capacity, and whoever is able to live upon him, so that he will spend what God has given, God does not cost a soul except what came to it [Al -Talqa: 7].* * * The third question: the disgraceful of this verse is that God Almighty does not cost worshipers except what they can do; Because he is informed that he does not cost anyone unless he can accommodate his ability, and the expansion is at the authority of the energy, so if God does not cost him, he does not have what you do not.He assigns him what is not able to him.* * * Then he said: The mother is not in her child, in which there are issues: the first question: Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr and Qatibah read about Al -Kisa’i: Raise, and Al -Kisae and Al -Farah said: It is a coordination on his saying: Do not cost Ali Bin Issa: This is a mistake; Because the formation is (no), but it is the second one in which the first entered, we have: Pure, it is correct that it is a lightning over The insult in the end, as it is said: there is no increase in no longer a lifetime.For the meeting of the two, it is said: a good man is a good man; That is because the origin of the word is destroyed, so one of the two times was tickled in the last, so it became not a harmful, as you say: Do not repeat, then you will be tickled, then he said: Do not say: Exalted: O you who believe, whoever wores you from his religion [Al -Maaidah: 54] Al -Hassan read: Facarded that the verb is for it.* * * The second question: His saying: Do not harm and bodies both of them are permitted in the language, but the two faces bear a look at the case of the slurring in the case ( One of them: that its origin is not to be in harmony by breaking the first rack, and on this face the woman is the effective act.And the second: that its origin is not a conformity with the opening of the first Arab, so the woman will be the verb (P-104) with the harm, and on the first direction, the meaning will be: By the reason for the delivery of the harm to the child, and that is that the woman is obeyed from his breastfeeding, with the fact that the father did not refer to her in the height of the livelihood and the ritual, so the one is the one, so the one is the one, so the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, so it is the one who is the one, so the one is the one, so the one who is the one who is the one, so the Its meaning: Do not be confused, that is, the harmful father does not do the mother, so the child is removed from her with her desire to hold her and the intensity of her love for him.And his saying: There is no birth in his son, that is: the mother who is harmful to the father does not do the father to throw the child to him, and the meanings are referring to anything, and it is one of them Because of the newborn.If it was said: Why did he say: “longing” and the verb?We said: Lojoh: one of them: that it is the same as the exaggeration; Harming those who harm you is stronger than harming those who do not harm you.The second: The mother and the father do not harm that the mother is not breastfed or the father will be subjected to and remove it from her.The third: that the intended for each one of them with the harm of the newborn is the opposite of the other, so that was in the truth.* * * The third question: His saying: Do not be a woman in her son, even if it is a news in the phenomenon, but it is intended from the forbidden, and it is the abuse of it, and the abuse of it, And the keepers.And his saying: There is no loyal to him in his son, who will be in charge Or that the ten is offended, and it will be carried by it on the birth of the child, so all of that is within this time, and God knows.As for the saying of the Exalted: And on the heir, like that, I know that when the male of the child and the male of the father came and the male of the parents, he carried in the heir to be added to the one who is added to the one who is in the heir, to be added to the heir, And the scholars are not They call a face that can be said by it except for them.The first saying, and it is stated by Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them: that the intention is the inheritance of the father; And that is because his saying: And on the heir, like that, it is given to his saying: And on the loyalty to him, they have their livelihood and their goodness, and what is between them The well -known, and the meaning is that the birth is for him, if he dies, then he will be inherited by the same as what is obligatory for him from the provision and the eclipse.It provides it and makes it over to the malevolent condition, which is the patronage of the known and avoiding the harm.Because if we are brought to us on the heir of the child and the father, too, and he inherited it, he led to a duty to spend on others, if he has money that is spent from him, and that is, and that is, and that is, and that is, and that is.From him that the boy, if he inherits from his father money, is that he needs those who pledge it and spend that money on him with the well -being, and he will pay it for him, He inherited the father.The second saying: that what is meant and the inheritance of the father is obligated to him when the father of the father is all that was obligatory for the father, and this is the saying of goodness and a mortality and my father is a Muslim and the judge, then the one who said: They differed that any inheritance is?It was said: It is the nerves without the mother and the brothers from the mother, and it is the saying of Omar, Al -Hassan, Mujahid, Giving, Safyan and Abraham, and it was said: He is the inheritance of the boy from the men and the people of the righteous The inheritance, which is the saying of Qatada and the son of Abi Lali, said: Al -Naqif is on the destiny of the inheritance, and it was said: The inheritance is from those who were merciful, forbidden without others.(P-105) Abi Hanifa and his companions.And know that the phenomenon of speech requires that there is no virtue between, inheritance and inheritance; Because it is the highest of the sake of the memorial, so it is not the mercy of the merciful, as the distant is like the closeness, and the women are like the men, and if only the mother is from that Positive to the right to it, it is also correct for its entry under the words; Because it may be a inheritance as well.The third saying: What is meant by the remaining inheritance is from the two parents, and it came in the famous supplication: and made the heir from us, that is, the rest, which is the saying of Safyan and a group.The righteous saying: He wanted the young heir himself, which is the inheritance of his dead father His mother is on his breastfeeding, and he is not forced to spend the boy except the parents, and he is the saying of your money and the Shafi’i.As for the saying of the Exalted: the same as that of that: from the horizon and the eclipse on the authority of Ibrahim, and it was said: From the release of the harm, from the people, Al -Zahri, and the laughter, and the sacrifice, Knowledge.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: if they want to be separated from them and disagree, no A wing of them, so I know that in the verse the first: the first question: in the separation, the first: the first: that the weaning; To say it to the Almighty: He carried it and his separation is three months [Al -Ahqaf: 15] Rather, the weaning was called the separation because the boy separates from the abuse of the son of the mother.Al -Mubarrad said: It is said: The child was separated from the mother, chapter and separation, and he was read by them in his saying: He carried him and his separation, and the separation is better; Because if he separated from his mother, he has separated from him, then they are a separation, the part of the fighting and the damage, and the separation was called a separation because it is a separation from the mother of it The country: If it comes out of it and separated it, the Almighty said: When he separated, I was tired of the soldiers [the cow: 249], and he knew that the bearing of the separation is on the weaning is the saying of the most.And know that it is exalted when he showed that the two full years is the time of the period of breastfeeding, and this verse must be carried out otherwise, so that it is not necessary until they are not required, then they are obligated, then the one who is obligated to the What is meant by this verse is that weaning before the two years is permissible, and among them is those who said: It indicates that weaning before the two years is permissible, and after that, it is also permissible On the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them.The pretext of the first saying is that what was before the verse is what was indicated by the weaning of weaning at the time of the two years.This verse is indicative of the weaning of weaning before the time of the two years.The pilgrimage of the second saying is that the child may be weak and he needs breastfeeding, and his throat will harm him as it is harmful before the two of the people, and he answered the first, and he answered the first, and he answered the first Weaning after the two years is rare, and carry the words on the rituals.And God knows.The second saying in the interpretation of the separation is that Abu Muslim, when he mentioned the first saying, he said: And it is necessary for another meaning, and it is that the one who is intended is the rhythm of the separation from the rhythm of the mother He obtained the consent and disagreement in that, and it was not returned because of that harm to the child.* * * (P-106) The second question: the rhetoric in the language: the consensus of the opinion, as well as the chastity, and the chastity is effective from it, such as the one, and it is the same, and it is the one who said: Abo Zaid: I was embarrassed and denied; That is, I did it for the sake of its running, and the streets: the belongings of the house; Because he appears to look, and they said: I saw him and fled; That is, I was shy, and the evil is the man of the man; Because it appears from his uniform and appears from his adornment, and the sign is to leave what is in your soul and his conversion to the one who addresses the briefing and otherwise.* * * The third question: the verse indicated that weaning is in less than two about two years old, only when the parents' consent is permissible and when the ritual is with the arms of the merchant From breastfeeding, you will be of weaning, And the father also might be bored of giving the wages on breastfeeding, so the weaning may be a motivation for that, but they have agreed to harm the burden of the child, for the burden of the child With the estimation of their successes, the mourning is considered with others, and when this is a distance to obtain the agreement of everyone on what is in which there is a new one, then it is the same.It is indicated that weaning before the two years is not harmful to it, so look at the charity of God Almighty with this small sins, how stipulated in Jawaz, the heep of his heights of the height On the authority of it, then when all of these parties were not expressed by the permission, but he said: There is no wing to you, and this is indicated that the human being is a lot of time More and his care for him is more severe.* * His Excellency said: If you want to be subjected to your children, then there is no wing to you if you are delivered what you have come to the well -known and fear God and know what God knows When the mother’s ruling indicated that she is more worthy of breastfeeding, he indicated that it is permissible for the enemy in this section on the authority of the mother to others.* * * Then in the verse: The first question: The owner of the “scout” said: (I put it in) a stabilized from the larger, it is said: I put the young woman and put it in the morning Two effective, as you say: The need succeeded and the Hajj is successful, and the meaning is that you are subjected You say: I succeeded the need, and do not remember those who succeeded it, and the judgment of all two acts of people was not the last of them Your children, that is, for your children, and delete the pain in order to be breastfed by; Because it is only for the children, and it is not permissible: I called more, and you want: for a good; Because it is a dress here, by disagreeing what we said in the breastfeeding.And the counterpart of the imam is the saying of the Almighty: and if the illusion or their weight [the woven: 3], that is, the same as their or the weight of them.* * * So doing it with the right of that husband who prevents her from breastfeeding, and that if the first husband divorces her, then breastfeeding will be deceived until he is a husband, and he will be married to her The woman is the acceptance of the child in order to harm the divorced husband, and it is for it, and it is that it is sick or cut off its son The righteousness of her son is permissible for the mother to the mother to other than her, but if we do not find another breeder, or we found it, but the righteousness does not accept its son, then it is for us.As for his words, the Exalted: If you are delivered, what you have come to the well -known, then he will have two issues: The first question: Ibn Katheer read the only one: “What came” is the one who is a thousand, and the rest is what you have come to the duration of the thousand.That is, you wanted to come to him, and as for the palace, it is possible: what you came to him, so the two verbs were deleted in the first and deleted a word (with him) in the second of the second.Asim (what you have gone), that is, what God has given you and your ability is upon him from the reward, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: and woke up from what made you the one who is useful in it [7].The second question: the surrender is not a condition for the permissibility and the health, but rather it is a scar to the first, and it is intended for it that the wage will be delivered to the breeder The same breath is satisfied, so that it becomes a reason for the state of the boy, and the stomach is in his reconciliation.Then, he was the Heavy verse with warning, so he said: Fear God and know that God is what you do with vision.
