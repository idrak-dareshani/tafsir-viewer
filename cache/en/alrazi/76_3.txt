The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: either, as well as, or as an infidelity in it: the first question: in the verse, sayings: The first: that “Shakir“ or “as“ two cases of distraction in “ The way is like it, and it is noticeable, and the meaning is that everything that relates to the guidance of God and his guidance.And the second saying: that his saying was stipulated as a thankful and infidelity of the guarantee, and the estimation: whether he was a complaint or was infidels.And the third saying: It is meaning that we have guided the path, to be either asking, or as disbelief, that is: to distinguish his thanks from his disbelief, and his obedience from his disobedience; As his saying: Let it be blessed, which is the best work [Hood: 7], and his saying: And we have lost us who are before them, so let them know, those who are the one who believed [3] And his saying: Let us give you until we know who are the ones who are patient and the people, and we will tell your news [Muhammad: 31] Al -Qafil said: And the metaphor of this word is the word of this word The saying: I have advised you, if you want, accept, and if you want to leave, that is: if you want, then the fulfillment is omitted, so the meaning is: We have given us the sake, and it is the way.So the fulfillment is deleted, and it may be that this is on the side For the disbelievers like this and for those who are like this, such as his saying: Say the truth from your Lord, so whoever wants, let him believe and whoever wants, let him be atoned [Al -Kahf: 29].The righteous saying: to be two cases of the path, that is: the path of the path, meaning: either a thankful way, either as an infidel, and the description of the path.Know that all of these sayings are appropriate to the dwarfs.And the fifth saying: It is the preservation of the people of the Sunnah, and the choice of the freedom: to be “in this verse as“ in this verse as “in his saying: either it is tortured or torture.” Tawbah: 106], and Al -Muddar: We guided him the way, then we made it a righteous or a righteous, and this is confirmed by this interpretation of what was narrated.The hammer is in “either”, and the meaning: As for Shakir, our success is, and as a disbeliever, we are thirsting for us, the dismissed said: This is a falsehood of falsehood; Because he is the Almighty after this verse threatens the infidels, and he said: We are accustomed to the disbelievers, peace, and pricing, and if the disbelief of the disbeliever was from the disbelief of the disbeliever, and the disbelief of the disbeliever, and the disbelief of the disbeliever To threaten him (P-2212) to him, and when this interpretation has been prolonged, it is that the truth is the first interpretation, which is that it is the highness The forced saying: that he did not guide the infidels to faith, our companions answered: that he is up to the infidels that he does not believe that he does not believe that he is a wrath that he has gone.Between science with the intensity of faith and the existence of faith, and this is Approval of the collection between the two opponents, if this does not become an excuse in the purity of the threat and the bounty, it is also permissible to create the disbelief in it, and it is not in it, and it is not in it, and it is not in it, and it is not in it, Al -Waqid, and if this is proven, it appears that this interpretation is the truth, and that the upcoming inclusion in the words of the disgraced is not a right, and the one who says it.The second question: It is the Almighty mentioned his blessings on the human being, and he began with the remembrance of the worldly blessings, then he mentioned after the religious blessings, then it is the same.And know that it is not possible to interpret the complainant and the infidels of those who are in the work of the act of thanks It is a determined, raised with the path of thank you, and what is meant by the infidels that is not acknowledging the righteousness It is proven, but it is denied and the thanks to it, and then the confinement is achieved, which is that the cost is either that it is a complaint, or that it is a disbeliever, and it is that it is a disbeliever Take this verse that there is no mediator between the obedience and the infidel, they said: Because the complainant is the obedient, and the infidels is the infidel, and God is the extent of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who denies the middle A disbelieving sin, and that every singer be infidel, and know that the Bayan who has summed up this dislocation, is that it is not what is meant by the complainant who is the one who does not Thank you, for that is a false and opposite falsehood.As for the ritual, because the Jew may be a complaint of his Lord with the fact that he is not obedient to his Lord, and the evildoer might be thankful for his Lord, with his Lord, with his Lord, with that he is not.The opposite, because the believer may not be anicable with thanksgiving or disbelief, but rather he will be hidden from them, so I have proven that it is not possible for you to do so The complainant is interpreted by those who are approved by the path of thank you, and the infidelity of those who are not recognized by that, and then the confirmation of the exclusivity, and the question of their question.And God knows.
