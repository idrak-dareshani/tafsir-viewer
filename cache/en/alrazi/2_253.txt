The Quranic researcher, the messengers, preferred some of them to one of them who spoke to God and raised some of them with grades, and we came to us, the son of Mary, the sons of the sons, and the soul of God Those who were after them came after what the sons came to them, but they disagreed, so whoever believed and whoever is among those who disbelieved, and if God does not, what God has gone, and what is the one who did not.Institutions: (P-165) The first question: (That) is a divorce, but he said: (That) and he did not say: Those the messengers, because he went to the group, as if he said: By lifting, because it is a row for that, and the informing of the appetite, then we preferred each other.The second question: in his saying: Those the messengers say: one of them: that what is meant by him: whoever is presented by the prophets upon them is the peace of the Qur’an, as well as the Qur’an Jacob and Moses, and others, may God’s prayers be upon them.The second: that what is meant by those who are offered their remembrance in this verse is like Ashmawil and Dadd, and you are over the saying of those who make him a prophet.The third: It is the saying of the deaf: that the messenger whom God sent to the heaving of corruption, those who have the reference to the saying of His Excellency: and if only the people The earth was spoiled.The third question: the face of this is the verse of what was before it, what the father of a Muslim mentioned is that he is the Almighty, Muhammad ﷺ from the lord of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The people of Moses: God showed us a wicker [Al -Nisa: 153], and their saying: Make us a deity as God has the gods [Al -A'raf: 138], and the people of Jesus after he witnessed from him and the one who witnessed it With the permission of God, they lied to him and threw him, and then he established a group of disbelief in him and they are the Juda, and a group of people claimed that they were his children, and he called him to the one who killed him.God lied to them, as well as the fullness His people are from denying and envy, so he said: These are the messengers who have spoken to God Almighty, and the remaining people raised the grades and the hands of Jesus in the spirit We mentioned it after the scene of the miracles, and you are a messenger like them, so do not grieve about what you see from your people, so if God will not, you will not be dispersed, and for you, and for you, and for you Ceid, and what it is estimated is that it is located, and in the sentence, the intended of this speech is the messenger of the Messenger ﷺ to harm his people for him.* * * The following question: The nation has gathered that some of the prophets are better than one, and that Muhammad ﷺ is better than all, and it is revealed to him: We sent you only a mercy to the two worlds [Al -Anbiya: 107].The pilgrimage The second: His Excellency said: We raised your remembrance for you [Explanation: 4] So he said in it because it is a century of the male of Muhammad with his remembrance in the word of the testimony, and in the word of God The elders are like that.The third pilgrimage: that he is the Almighty who obeyed his obedience, so he said: Whoever obeys the Messenger, then God has obeyed [Women: 80] and sold him with his goodness, and he said: They sell God, the hand of God, according to their hands [Al -Fath: 10] and his pride in his pride, and he said: And God has pride and his Messenger [the hypocrites: 8] To be satisfied with him [Repentance: 62] and answered him by answering him, and he said: O you who believe, respond to God and the Messenger [Al -Anfal: 24].The fourth pilgrimage: that God is up to be praised that every surah of the Qur’an said: So they came with a wall of the like [Al -Baqarah: 23] Verses, and God was united by all three verses of the Qur’an, and when all the Qur’an was six thousand verses, as well as a verse, it is necessary that the miracle of the Qur’an should not be a miracle of the Qur’an A fullest and tidal thousand.(P-166) And if this is proven, then he says: God will be mentioned by Moses to do nine signs of evidence, so that the supervision of Muhammad will be honored.The fifth pilgrimage: that the miracle of our Messenger ﷺ is more preferred than the miracles of the path of the Prophet, so our Messenger must be more preferred than the elderly.The first Bayan said upon him, peace be upon him: The second Bayan is that the breach is the more he was honored, the more her owner was honored by the king.The sixth pilgrimage: that the miracle of peace be upon him is the Qur’an, and it is from the speeches of the forefathers and the voices, which are symptoms that are not the remaining, and the brightest of the miracles of the wicked of the sins of the people of the people of the Then he made him made a miracle of Muhammad ﷺ remaining to the last of the forever, and the miracles of the wickedness of the prophets, a decrease.The next argument: It is up after what he narrated the conditions of the Prophet, peace be upon them.Whoever is before him, either to be said: He was commanded to carry out with them in the origins of religion, and it is not permissible because it is imitated, or in the righteousness of the debt We copied the bricks, and he only remained that the meant man is the merits of the ethical, so as if he had grabbed him, he said: We are upset with them, so they are from them, so they are from them.And the best of it and it was a matter of them in all of them, and this requires that he gathered in it from the satisfactory qualities that were not separated from them, so it is obligatory to be more than them.The eighth pilgrimage: that peace be upon him was sent to all creation, and that requires that his hardships be more, so it must be He is preferred, but he was sent to all creation, and he said: “We have only sent you all for people [Saba: 28].A period of money, no agents and supporters, if he says to all the two worlds: O infidels, everyone has become a reasons for him, and then he becomes a disagreement from all, and the hardships are, and you are the greatness For Moses, peace be upon him, when he was sent to the children of Israel, then he was not afraid of anyone except from Pharaoh and his people, and as for Muhammad, peace be upon him.If it was said to him: This country is free from the friend and the companion in which one man has strength and weapon, so go to him today and only and he was informed of him, When his soul was allowed to do so, with it that he is one person, and if he was told: He went to a distant shift in which there is no angel or a friend, and a friend, and a friend of the friend The lonely for that of that on the human being, but the Prophet ﷺ is that he was commanded that the length of his night and his night go to every age to the jinn and the one who is for the sake of the elderly The accustomed of them is that they repeat it, harm it, and hide it, and then it is upon him, peace be upon him, and he did not dill from this case and did not hold it, but he worsened to it.You are lamented in the purification of the religion of God, the greatest of hardship, and for this he said: The Almighty said: It is not equal from you who agreed from before the conquest and the killer [Al -Hadid: 10] and it is known that that was the one who was on the authority of the ritual The greatness of the companions in the cause of that intensity, then what you think of the Messenger, and if it is proven that its hardship is greater than the hardship of it otherwise, it is necessary for it to be the best of it.It is not for him to say to him, peace be upon him: (P-167) The ninth pilgrimage: that the religion of Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the best of the consequences, so it is necessary that Muhammad be the best of the prophet.Bayan Al -Awal: that he has made Islam a copy of the captives of the religion, and the copyist must be better for him to say to him, peace be upon him: He worked with it to the Day of Resurrection.The elders of the Prophet.The tenth Hajj: The nation of Muhammad ﷺ is better than the nations, so it is obligatory to be the best of the prophet.The first Bayan said: You were the best of a nation that was brought out to people [Al -Imran: 110].Bayyan: that this nation was attained by this guidance for the follow -up of Muhammad ﷺ, he said: Say: If you love God, then follow me, and God will love you.And the virtue of the follower requires the virtue of the rumor, and also if Muhammad is more reward Because it is closed to jinn and humanity, it is necessary for its rewards more, because the many respondents have a trace on the heart of the rumor.The sharp pilgrimage is ten: It is upon him the peace of the messengers, so it is necessary to be more than preferred, because the virtuous copying of the prejudice is a rug in the mind.The second pilgrimage is ten: to precede some of the prophets on some of the matters: including: the many miracles that are indicative of the righteousness To honor them, and he has obtained the right of our Prophet, peace be upon him, preferring three thousand, and it is in the phrase on sections, from which it is related to the ability, such as Few, and their narrators from the little water, and from it what is related to the sciences, such as the news about the seduction, and the eloquence of the Qur’an, and from it his choice in itself with the same He attributed to the Arabs, and also was in the end of the courage, as it was narrated that he said after a struggle on me, may God be pleased with him, to Amr ibn Wad: How are you, how are you?I found it, even if all the people of the city were on a side while I was on the side of them, I would have been able to do them and said: He gave it, and it comes out of this valley, and he will fight you, and the hadith is in the end of it His creation, his dream, his savings, his eloquence, and his generosity, and the books of the hadith are developed by detailing these chapters.The third pilgrimage is ten: His saying is upon him, peace be upon him: Peace: “I am the master of Adam, and no pride.” And peace be upon him said: Anas said: He said ﷺ: “I am the first people who are married if they are sent, and I am engaged to them if they came out, and I preach them if they are forgotten, for the brigade of Hamad in my hand, and I am honored the son of Adam on my Lord,” Abbas said: People of the companions were sitting, so he heard the Messenger of God ﷺ their hadith, so some of them said: It is surprising that God took the rituals of the rituals, and he said: He spoke to him, and another said: The word of God and His Spirit, and another said: God has chosen him, and the Messenger of God came out and said: He has heard you God is the same, and Moses saved God while he is like that, and Jesus is the Spirit of God, and he is like you, and I have been chosen by God, and he is like that Fakhra, and I am the first to be a companion and I am the first to be intercessor on the day of resurrection and no good, and I am the first to move the throat of paradise, so he opens to me, and I will enter it, and I will enter it, The first and the others, and no pride." (P-168) The companions “that he appeared on the son of Abi Talib from far away, and peace be upon him: This is the master of the Arabs, so Aisha said: Did you not master the Arab?He said: I am the master of the two worlds while he is the master of the Arabs.ﷺ: “I was given five, and no one was given before me and no pride, I was sent to redness and bonds, and the Prophet was before me sent to his people, and he made the land of the And purchasing, and I was fired in front of me in front of me, a month, and the riches were dissolved for me, and it was not for anyone before me, and I was given the rush, so I will be blessed to my mother, for my mother.Humanity for those who do not share anything with God.The wise, the symbolism in the report of this meaning: every prince is that his insurance is on the destiny Its support is the destiny of that village, and whoever owns the honesty and the western, he needs the money and hideout So he was given from the jurisprudence and the naughty known for the amount of the mission, so the messengers are sent to his people on a special orphanage of the earth, but it is from the ground, but it is given from this The spirituality is of the amount of that place, and the messengers to all the people of the honesty and the west of their humanity and their paradise must be given and that it is given from the knowledge that it is worth it.With the matters of the people of the honesty and the west, and if the proportion of the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ to the prophecy of the wiping of the prophet as the proportion of all the evil and the hardships of the heart of the The special is, and when it was not a crime, it was given from the treasures of the rule and the knowledge that was not given one before it, so there is no generosity in the knowledge of the one who has not He Almighty in his right: So he revealed to his servant what he revealed [Al -Najm: 10] and in the eloquence until he said: The four -year -old Hajj: Muhammad ibn Issa al -Hakim narrated the mercy of God, may God have mercy Abraham is a successor, and Moses was saved, and I took me in love with me, then he said: My pride and my majesty to my love on my mind and my success.Hammam ibn Mnabeh on the authority of Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: A place of a milk from the angles of its angles, so they made people float with it The sons admire them, and they say: Do you not put here a milk, so that your construction is completed?Hamid: I was that milk.The nineteenth pilgrimage: that God Almighty called a prophet in the Qur’an, he called him in his name, O Dame As for the Prophet, peace be upon him, he called him with his saying: Oh, the Prophet [Anfal: 64], O Messenger [Al -Ma’idah: 41] and that is the benefit of the grace.* * * And the violator took the face of his faces: The first: that the miracles of the prophet were greater than his miracles, because the peace be upon him was a prostration of the money, and he was a prostration of the money Peace is like that, and that the grace of peace be upon him was thrown into the great fires, and it was flipped by a wind and a bit of it, and that Moses, peace be upon him, did not say that He (P-169) had the same, and he has been addicted because he has the same in his hand, and Silman was gyn, human, funny, obscenity, and winds were mocked for him, and he was not for him.God has brought him in the childhood and appreciated him on the neighborhood of the death and the greatness of the majesty and the ripe, and that was not the same as Muhammad.The second pilgrimage: that he was called by Ibrahim in his book, and he said: And God took Abraham Khalil [Women: 125], and he said in Moses, peace be upon him, and he said: Jesus, peace be upon him: So we breathed into it from our soul [Prohibition: 12] and something of that, and he did not say it in the right of Muhammad, peace be upon him.The third argument: His saying, peace be upon him: “Do not prefer me to Yunus ibn Mattam” and said ﷺ: “Do not choose between the prophets”.The fourth pilgrimage: narrated, “On the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said: We were in the mosque, so we were the best of the Prophet, so we mentioned the prolongation of his servants, By the criminality of God, the Almighty, and Jesus by raising him to the sky, and said: The Messenger of God is better than them, he was sent to all people, and he was forgiven for him, and he is not a sin, The Prophet, so the Messenger of God entered and said: What are you?Qutta and he did not care about it.The answer is that the statement of peace be upon him, who is prostrating to the angels, it is not necessary for it to be better than Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the evidence of his saying ﷺ: The day of resurrection, "and said:“ I was a prophet and a long time between water and the mourning.It is the Almighty, praying for himself on Muhammad, and commanded the angels and those who believe in the prayers upon him, and that is better than the prostration of angel The angels commanded the stomach of Adam, and commanded them to pray on Muhammad ﷺ close.The second: that prayer is upon Muhammad, peace be upon him, always until the Day of Resurrection, and the prostitution of the angels, peace be upon him, was only one time.The third: that the prostration is for Adam, but the angels assumed it, and the prayer is on Muhammad ﷺ, but the Lord of the two worlds assumed it, then he commanded the angels and the believers.And the lord: that the angels were commanded by the prostration of Adam, for the sake of the light of Muhammad, peace be upon him, in the mountain of Adam.If it was said: He is the Almighty, who specialized in the knowledge, and he said: Adam taught all the names.[Al -Baqarah: 31].He found you lost and guided [Al -Duha: 7] and also, and Adam learned, God is the Almighty.Shadid Al -Qudah taught him [Al -Najm: 5].The answer is that he said in the knowledge of Muhammad ﷺ: He taught you what you did not know and the best of God is great for you [Women: 113] and he said: And the Almighty said: The Most Merciful taught the Qur’an [Rahman: 1 - 2] and peace be upon him said: ( Between him and between his words, the Almighty: He taught him the power of the forces [Al -Najm: 5] that is according to the recitation, and the learning is from God, as he said: He said: He said: [Al -Sajdah: 11] Then he said: God dies when it dies [Al -Zumar: 42].“ It indicates that the creation of Noah is good.We said: It is upset, he said: We sent Noah to his people to warn your people from before, to bring them a passionate torment.In it: And we have not sent you only a mercy to the two scientists [Al -Anbiya: 107].Lord, do not virginity on the ground from the disbelievers, a household [Noah: 26] and the punishment of Muhammad, peace be upon him.It was mentioned in the books of the evidence of the prophecy in the interview of each one of them, which is better than it is for Muhammad ﷺ, and this book does not need more than what we remember.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Some of them have spoken to God, in his books: the first question: What is meant by him is the one who spoke to God Almighty, and the distraction is removed as a lot of words Hope: In it, the soul is uncomfortable, and the eyes are delighted [Al -Zukhruf: 71].The second question: Reading (the word of God) with the instance, and the first reader is the best of grace, because every believer is that he speaks to God on what he said: His Lord, “It is the honor to speak to God Almighty, and the al -Yammani read: (as God) from the end of the whole, and their saying is indicated by them: the words of God in the sense of the integrity.The third question: they disagreed that those who spoke to God, the listener is the eternal and eternal words, which is not a rudder or voice, or others?Al -Ash'ari said and followed him: The listener is that, because when the vision of what is not forbidden is not forbidden, so it is not possible to hear what is not the same, and he said: That words are referred, but the listening is the letter and the voice.The following question: They agreed that Moses, peace be upon him, intended to say: God, with his saying: The choice of Moses, his people, seventy men, [Al -A'raf: 155] Is he heard by Muhammad ﷺ the night of the naked?They differed from them from them who said: We are blessed with his saying: So he revealed to his servant what he revealed [Al -Najm: 10].If it was said: His saying is up to the Almighty: Some of them have spoken to God who is intended by the end of the vengeance Peace be upon him, he said: God spoke to Moses Taklaim [Women: 164] Then he came in the Qur’an a call between God and between Ablis, when he said: So look at me to the day The eyes of the known day of time [Al -Hijr: 36-38] to the last of these verses, and the appearances of these verses indicate a lot of calls between God and between God The purpose of the honor is how to get the slander?If it is not obligatory, then how he mentioned it in the exposure of the supervision of Moses, peace be upon him, when he said: And God spoke to Moses Taklaim [Women: 164]?The answer is that the story of the Ibsis does not have what is indicated that he said that these answers were with him, without a median, so perhaps (P-171) was the middle of it.As for the saying of the Exalted: He raised some of them with grades, and he said: The first: that what is meant by him is that the paths of the messengers are different, and that is because he is the one who is the one.And no one like this is the same, and the king of the king and the Prophet did not get this, and this is not for him for others He has his father, and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him, is devoted to that he is closed to heaven and humanity, and that his law is a relaxed for all the parties, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the part Standing and perpetrators, but if we carry it on The miracles are also faced; Because every one of the prophets has been given another type of miracle, which is appropriate for his time, so the miracles of peace be upon him, which is the heart of the stick, is alive, It was like a young man with what was the people of that era in which he is the magic, and the miracles of Jesus, peace be upon him, are the light of the greatest and the ripe, and the life of the mud, The era is presented in it, which is the medicine, and the miracle of Muhammad, peace be upon him, which was the Qur’an from the speeches of rhetoric, eloquence, rhetoric, and poems, and the phrase, With the few and the many, and the survival and the number of survival, and with strength and the integrity of power, and there is a third face, which is that what is meant is to remove the custodians with what is attached And the companions and the power of the state, if the three faces are contemplated, you know that Muhammad ﷺ was a collection of all, then his installation is higher and miraculous and miracle.And his country is greater.The second saying: that what is meant by this verse is praiseworthy, peace be upon him, because he is the preference for all, but he said: He raised some of them with the rituals of the way A great action, and he is said to him: Who did this?He says: One of you or one of you and wants him to himself, and that will be more trapped by the explicitness of it, and the shed will be asked about the people of the people, then the people of the people, then the people, then the people of the If I had a third, I would have mentioned the third, he wanted to himself, and if he said: If I had a matter, myself would not have a luxury in it.If it was said: The concept is from his saying: He raised some of them with the concepts of his saying: Those messengers preferred some of them to some of them?And also his saying: Those the messengers preferred some of them to have a total words, and his saying after that: Some of them have spoken to God, and that is a good way in After that: some of them raised the reinforcements of that whole, and it is known that the restoration of the words after the breastfeeding in the separation of its parts will be.The answer is that his saying: Those messengers preferred them to some of them indicate the proof of the preference of some of the bit of some, but it is indicated by the one that indicates that There is a lot or a few tags, so there is no significance in it, so it was his saying: He raised some of them with excessive extension, so it was not a good.As for his words, the Almighty: And we have come to Moses the book and we have been in our question: The words to the Maghreb and said: Some of them have spoken to God and raised some of them with grades, and then just from the Maghreb to the first type, and he said: And Jesus, the son of Mariam, came to us.About addressing to The Maghreb and then to the addressee once?.“ Choose the memorial of the absence.* * * As for his saying: I am Jesus, the son of Mary, the sons, but he was chosen to memorize the address On the bone of orphans.The second question: Why is Moses and Jesus specially among the prophets?Is that indicating that they are better than others?The answer is that the specialization is that their miracles are the most powerful and stronger than the miracles of others and also, so their nation is present in this time and the nations They are guided, so they specialize in the remembrance of the remembrance of the stabbing in their nation, as if it was said: These two messengers are with the righteousness The purpose of their nation will obtain, but rather they are disputed and violated, and the duty of them to obey them.The third question: Issa, the son of Mariem, specializes in giving sons, indicates that it is deluded that the gathering of the sons is what happened in otherwise, and it is known that it is that it is that it is permissible.They specially mention them because these sons are stronger?So we say: The evidence of Moses, peace be upon him, was stronger than the evidence of Jesus, peace be upon him, if it is not stronger, then no less than equality.Answer: What is meant by the alerts is the pretext of the verbs of Jews, whereby they denied the prophecy of Jesus, peace be upon him, with what he appeared on his hands.The fourth question: the evidence is a collection of a few, and that is not appropriate for this denomination.We said: We do not surrender that it is a few, and God knows.* * * As for his words, he said: We supported him in the spirit of Jerusalem, and he has two issues: the first question: Jerusalem is sacked by the people of the Hijaz and the mastery of it.The second question: In his interpretation of sayings: The first: Al -Hassan said: Jerusalem is God Almighty, and His Spirit is Gabriel, peace be upon him, and the addition to the mourning, and the meaning, Peace be upon him, his first, his stretching, and at the end of it, but at the beginning of the matter, he said it: We have breathed into it from our soul, but in its mediation, it is Gabriel, peace be upon him, peace be upon him, peace be upon him.He kept it from the elders, but at the end of the matter, he wanted Jews to kill him Peace be upon him: Say: The spirit of Jerusalem is revealed [Al -Nahl: 102].And the second saying: It is the one who is transmitted from Ibn Abbas that the spirit of Jerusalem is the name that Jesus, peace be upon him, revived.The third saying: It is the saying of my father Muslim: The spirit of the sanctuary, which is supported by it, may be the purified spirit that is God bless her, and he showed him from others who were created from the meetings of the male and female sides.* * * Then the Almighty said: And if God wills, what was followed by those who were after them after what the sons came to them, and in which there are questions: (p-173) the first question: The messengers, then the sons came to them, and the evidence laughed at them, and their rituals were disappeared, so whoever believes and among them who disbelieved, and the causes of that.The second question: The saying that all the tilts are in the judiciary of God and his destiny with this verse, and they said: The estimation of the verse is: and if God wills, and they will not be fulfilled The fight against the waters of the fighting, and the integrity of the obligation indicates the numbers of the obligatory Agreement, but the time of the fighting was the will of the fighting, and there is no doubt that that fighting is disobedient, so that it indicates that the disbelief, faith, obedience, and disobedience are the authority of God And his will, and on the fact that killing the infidels and fighting them for the believers with the will of God Almighty.As for the disgraced, they answered the recipient, and they said: The intended from the verse is that the disbelievers, if they kill, are not that of them, and this is the same It is said: It is up to the people of their family and their exterminates, or it is said: If only the power and destiny will be called, or it is said: If he wanted, he would prevent them from fighting for mighty, and if it is for you, and if it is for you, then if it is for me, then he will be forced to.God is intended from these types of will, and this is what is said: If the imam wanted, the Magi did not worship the fire in his kingdom, and you did not drink the Christians, and the wallow He mentioned it, and so here, then the judge confirmed these wages and said: If the waters are falling on faces, and fulfilled the faces; There is no significance in the phenomenon on the special direction, especially these types of waters are oppressed.The answer is that the types of will, even if they are disturbed and decorated, but they are shared in the generalities of their universe, and the one who is mentioned in the verse in the provision of the condition is that it is the matter of the condition.Wita, not from where it is a special will, so this name will be, and it is specialized in the will of the will with a special will, and it is either the will of the destruction, or the will of the destruction, or the will And destiny, or the will of oppression and albums, is a supply of divorce, which is not permissible, and as this specialization is unlike the appearance of the word, so it is on the authority Because God is exalted, if he is a scholar of the fighting of fighting, and the knowledge of the fighting of the fighting if there is a number of fighting, a group between the negation and the rituals, and the rituals, and between the ritual, and between Knowledge is the existence of fighting if he wanted to fight, then it would be He wanted to collect between the negation and the confirmation, and that is referred, so it was proven that the appearance of the verse against against their saying, and the proof of the seat against the saying.* * * Then he said: But they disagreed, for those who believed, and for those who disbelieved, then he mentioned our remembrance at the beginning of the verse that the meaning: and if he wanted, they would not be overlook So, they did not kill, and this verse indicates that the verb does not happen until after the call of the preacher, because it is clear that the conflict is necessary for the fighting, and the meaning of the meaning is that the meaning is necessary They invite them to the fighting, and that indicates that the fighting does not fall except for this call, and on the fact that when he obtained this call and the fighter, then this is the case The prohibition of Al -Qaqaa at the Adam Al -Da’i, and a duty of the supplication of the preacher, and when it is proven that the appearance of all that all of God and his destiny, because the curtains are not God creates it in the slave of the lies, so the verse was also indicative of this direction on the validity of our people.* * * Then he said: And if God wills, they would not have been done, then it was said: What is the best in the frequency?We said: The one said, may God have mercy on him, may God bless him: He repeated him to confirm the words and a lie to those who claimed that they did so from (p-174) when they are not.From God Almighty.* * * Then he said: But God does what he wants, and he will agree with those who are heard and let those who are, do not be satisfied with him in his action, and the companions of the righteous have been exhausted by the righteousness that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The believers, and they said: Because the characteristic helps that it is an adequate who wants faith from the believer, and the verse indicates that he does everything that he wants, so he is the one who does not want to be.Exalted, and also when he indicates that he would do everything he wants, and if he wanted faith from the infidels, he would do faith in them, and they were believers, and he did not.He does not want faith from them, so this verse was indicative of the question of the creation of the work, and on the question of the will of the gyads, and the dismissed, they restrict the divorced and say: He does everything that he wants from the same actions, and this is weak: for its faces: one of them: that it is a supply of the divorced.The second: It is on this piousness that makes the verse to show the clarifications, as it becomes the meaning of the verse that he does what he does.The third: that every one is like that, so it is not in the description of God, the Almighty, with that evidence on the fullness of his ability and the highest of his arrangement, and God knows best.
