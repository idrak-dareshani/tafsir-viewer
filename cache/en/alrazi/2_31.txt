The second Qur’anic researcher: One of the people who said: His saying: He taught Adam the names all of them, that is, his knowledge of the attributes of the ages, their curses, and their characteristics, The heavens or of the heavens, if it was from the heavens, the name is the mark, and the attributes of the things and its curses and its characteristics indicate what it is, so it is correct that the description is from The heaven is like that; Because the evidence of the thing is like the ritual of that thing, then the knowledge of the evidence is before the knowledge of the meaning, so the indicators were the highest in the truth The language is that what is meant is from the name, so that the people of the grammar are allocated to the name of the name with the special conservation, but there is no one who is a person, and there is no one who is a person, and there is no one who is a person.This interpretation is possible according to the language, it is necessary to be the intention, not otherwise, for its wings: one of it: that the guidance is in the knowledge of the facts Its names, and the holding of the reminded words of the formation of the guidance on what is required of the sake of the virtue of his pregnancy on what is not like that.And the second: that the definition is permissible and improving what is able to be the same in the sentence in the sentence, for whoever is aware of the language and the eloquence, it is good for him to say that he is good.Sibl Al -Taddi: I come with words like my words in the eloquence, but the Arabic is not good from him to say to the Al -Zanji in the presentation of the definition: There is no way for him to know the languages ​​of the bit: but that only with learning, then if the learning is obtained, the knowledge is obtained with it, but not, but not, It is able to obtain it, and the fate of the conflict is correct in it.The second saying: It is the most famous, that what is meant is the names of all that God created from the gender of the events from all the different languages ​​that the day of the day is spoken Farisiyah and Romaiya and others, and the son of Adam, peace be upon him, spoke to these languages, and when Adam died and his son was separated in the aspects of the world A certainty of these languages, so that the tongue was overwhelmed by it, and when the period took place and died from them a century after a century, they forgot the elders of the languages, so this is the cause Peace be upon him.The people of Al -Ma’ani said: His Excellency said: He taught Adam the names in which there must Adam the names of the names, they said: But the first is the first; For his saying: They told me with the names of these and his saying: So when he mourned them with their names [Al -Baqara: 33] and he did not say: When God taught him the Almighty The types of all the names, and in the names there was nothing to be sane, and why did he say their offer and did not say its offer?We said: Because when it was in its beautiful sentence, humanity, and gin, and they are the minds, so he dominated the most complete; Because the Arabs were used to be the same as the perpetrator of the deficiency, the more they prevail.* * * The third question: It is one of the people who touched it with the Almighty saying: I would like me with the names of these on the permissibility of the unbearable and weakened.Because he is upset, but he signed them with his knowledge, with their miracle, on the path of crying, and it is indicated by his saying: If you are true.(P-163) The Following question: The disgraced said: What appeared from the one who has peace be upon him, peace be upon him, from his knowledge of the arms, which is indicative of the prophecy of the Prophet, And the closest is that it was a juice to the passion, and it is also no longer to be a footsteps to those who directed the determination to them from the angels; Because all of them, and if they were a messenger, they may be sent to the Messenger as a sacrifice, peace be upon him.To return, it is obligatory to be a miracle, and if it is proven that it is a miracle, it is proven that it is a messenger in that time, and it is a saying that he says that there is no To return; Because the knowledge of the language of those who taught it is the highest, and its incursion is for those who did not teach God not to be a contradiction to the return, and it is also: That name is a place for those names or what they have known, so if you know that, they were able to remember the names of these names The opponent and the fake and the guidance appear, and if they did not know that, then they know that peace be upon him, in which he was mentioned in the place One of those names?And know that this question can be paid from two faces: The first: Perhaps every kind of angels had a language of these languages, and all of the rituals were ignorant, Then, all the types of angels are attended, and that peace be upon him, all of these languages ​​are prompted to them, so all of them were known to them, so all of the lines of the rhetoric, so that he had a kind of people in this way.With this way, it is true, except that with their families, they were rewarded for the knowledge of these languages ​​with their families, so that was a miracle.The second: It is not forbidden to say: He is the highest of them, before they hear from the Adam upon him, peace be upon him.The names are known to be honest in it, so they knew it as a miracle, and we greeted us that he appeared on him with a supernatural act of return, so it is not permissible for you to be Elasia and they are with us Approximately, and then the words become in this question, raised on the words in them, and the one who cut off the peace be upon him, he was not a prophet in that If he was a prophet in that time, the disobedience had been issued after the prophecy, and that is not permissible, so it is not necessary for a prophet to be a prophet in that The breasts of the custody of it after this existence in the agreement, and that is the zalat from the door of the cabinets on what will come to his explanation, if God wills, and the Almighty will be upon the authority of God Cardness, compassion, and cursing, and all of that on the Prophet is unable, so it must be said: that fell before the prophecy.And secondly: If he was a messenger in that time, he would have either be a jurisdiction to anyone or would not be, if it was a close to anyone, then it is that it is the right of the angels, or it is the right to the angels, or it is the right to the angels, or it is a millions, or it is a millions, or it is the one, then it is a millions, or it is the one, then it is the right to the angels, then it is the right to the angels, then it is the right to the angels, then it is the right to the angels, then it is the right to the angels, then it is the right to the angels, then it is a millions of angels, The first is false; Because the angels are with the proud of the good than the humanity, and it is not permissible to make the debt a messenger to the honorable; Because the Messenger [a leader] and the nation are followed, and made the monotheistic the most honorable of the original, and also, the woman is to accept the saying of whom he is from his soul.This is why he said: And if we had made it a king, we would have made it a man [Al -Anam: 9], and it is not permissible to be a juice to the human being; Because there were no one of the human beings except a passion, and if the passion was known to the cost, not by the mediation of Adam; To say it to the Almighty: Do not bring this tree [the cow: 35] they saw them with this cost, and what made Adam and a medium, and it is not permissible to be a jinn; Because it was not one of the heaven in the sky, and it is also not permissible to be a juice to anyone; Because the intended of making it the messenger of the Tablig, where it was not reported, it was not (P-164) in making it a plus a messenger, and this face is not in the end of the power.And the third of it: His Exalted: Then his Lord has given him [Taha: 122].Filled, and if that time is not, it must not be a messenger; Because the mission and the news are abandoned; Because the news has no meaning except to specialize in the types of supervisors, and everyone who made God a messenger has lost it with that; To say: God knows that he will make his message [Al -Anam: 124].* * * Fifth question: Remember in his saying: If you are honest and faced: one of them: it is meaning that they teach me the names of these if you know that you are true.And the second: it is notified, tell me, and do not say anything but truth and sincerity, so the imposition of it is the confirmation of what he warned against them from the shortcomings and the rewards; Because when they are able to do themselves, if they were informed, they would not be honest, nor have them A way, know that this is an excuse for them.And the third of it: If you are honest in your saying that there is nothing that you worship with creation except when you are reconciled [to him], and you are in it and he is the one who says: And its booster: If you are honest in your saying that I did not create creation unless you know from it, then tell me about the names of these.* * * The sixth question: This verse is indicative of the grace of knowledge, for it is the grace of what I appear as the fullness of his ruling in his creation, but the peace of God If if there was an honorable thing, it would have been a matter of knowledge, then it would be the obligation to appear.And what is said, as for the book, Fujah: The first: that God is the Almighty, the knowledge of the rule, then it is the Almighty, the greatness of the rule of wisdom, and that is the same.Bayan is that he was called the knowledge of the rule of what is narrated from a fighter that he said: The interpretation of wisdom in the Qur’an is on four or one of them: one of them: the preaching of the Qur’an, what is the Qur’an: From the book and the ruling [the cow: 231] means the sermons of the Qur’an, and in the women: God revealed to you the book and the rule [the women: 113] means the preaching, and the same.And the second: the ruling in the sense of understanding and the knowledge is the saying of the Almighty: The judgment came to him in a boy [Mary: 12] and in Laqman: And we have come to the rule of the ruling: Antigraphy, those who have come to the book and wisdom [Al -Anam: 89].And the third of it: the ruling in the sense of the prophecy in the women: the righteousness of the book and the ruling has come to us.Al -Baqara: And God gave him the king and wisdom [Al -Baqara: 251].And its booster: the Qur’an in the bee: Call to the path of your Lord with wisdom [the bee: 125] and in the cow: and whoever provides the rule is a lot of good [269].And all of these faces when the investigation is returned to knowledge, then you think that God Almighty is given what was given from the science except the few who said: And what you have given is from the knowledge The world with a little families, say the enjoyment of the world a little [Al -Nasa: 77], so what he called a little, we cannot realize your fullness, so what you think of what he called, On the lowness of the world and the many wisdom that the world is the one who is destined to be the one who is the number of the time, and the science is not the end of its ability, its number, and its duration, and the one who is from it It alerts you to the virtue of science.The second: His Excellency said: Say: Is it equal to those who know and those who do not know [Al-Zamer: 9] And he separated between the seventh of a bit (p-165) Al -Khabith and Al -Tayyib said: Say: Al -Khabith and Al -Tayyib are not equal [Al -Maaidah: 100] Meaning the permissible and the forbidden, and separated between the blind and the vision, so he said: And the shadow, he said: Or is the shadows and light equal [the pursuit: 16] and separated between paradise and fire, and between the shadow and the forefathers, and if you hope for all of you, you will be among you The scientist and the ignorant.The third: His saying: obey God and obey the Messenger and the first of you [the women: 59] and what is meant by the first of the scholars is the most correct of the sayings; Because the downside must obey the scholars and not reflect, then look at this arrangement, for he is the highest of the scholar in the two of the two of his book: God is that there is no god but He, the angels, and the first of knowledge [Al -Amran: 18], and he said: Obey God and obey the Messenger, and the first of you is from you [the women: 59] and then it is more The first arrangement is in two verses, so he said: And what he knows is only to be interpreted by God and those who are established in knowledge [Al -Amran: 7] and he said: Say enough for you and for you, and from God, and from God, and from you [Raiding: 43].The lord: God raises those who believe in you and those who have given knowledge of the grades [Al -Mujdalah: 11] and know that he is the highest of the cards for the four of the categories: Badr said: The believers who are those who are mentioned and their hearts are exalted [Anfal: 2] to his saying: They have trades with their Lord [Anfal: 4].And the second: for the two directions, he said: And God preferred the two sides over the people [Al -Nasiyah: 95].And the third: for the righteous, he said: Whoever comes to him is a believer who has done good things, for those who have the rituals of God [Taha: 75].The lord: for the scholars, he said: And those who have given the knowledge of the grades [the argument: 11], and God is good for the people of Badr over other than the believers, and the one who is the one who is the one The one who preferred to the righteous, and preferred the righteous over these degrees, then the scholars preferred over all the items in degrees, so it is necessary to be the best of the people.Fifth: His Excellency said: God is afraid of his servants of the scholars [Fateer: 28] For God Almighty has described the scholars in his book with five consequences, one of them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the faith We believed in it [Al -Amran: 7].And the second: Al -Tawahid and testimony, the witness of God [Al -Amran: 18] to his saying: The first of knowledge [Al -Amran: 18].And the third: crying and choosing to the taste they cry [Al -Asra: 109].And its lord: The fear is that those who have given knowledge before it [Al -Asra: 107] the verse.Fifth: The fear is that God is afraid of his servants of the scholars [Fateer: 28] As for the news, he is a wagon: one of them: it was narrated that it is fixed from Anas, who said: The Messenger of God said: The meeting of God From the fire, let him look at the learners, and who is my soul in his hand, there is no learner who dispenses with the door of a world, unless God wrote to him with all the servants of the servants A city in paradise, and walks on the ground and the earth, seeking forgiveness for him, touching and erasing a forgiveness for him, and the angels witnessed to them that they are the rituals of God.And secondly: On the authority of Anas, he said: “He who asks for knowledge to others, and he did not come out of the world until the knowledge comes to him, and he will be for him Like the fasting days, the right-handed, and the opponent is his night, and a door of knowledge is learned by the man is better than (P-166) that the father of Qabis is a gold, and he will be spent.And the third of it: on the authority of Al -Hasan, “Whoever comes to the death while asking the knowledge to revive the Islam between him and between the prophets, one in the jinn”.And its booster: Abu Musa Al -Ash'ari is a mourning.Place my knowledge in you to torture you, and they went out, and I forgive you.Fifth: peace be upon him: “The best teacher if he dies, he cries with him the good of the sky, the animals of the earth, and the two whales of the seas.” And its sixth: Abu Hurairah, Merfa, “Whoever prayed the successor of a scholar of scholars, as if he prayed the successor of a prophet from the Prophet”.And the seven of it: Ibn Omar Marfoua.For people, then the scientist will see her, and he will remove her, and the worshiper is accepted by his worshipers, he does not go and does not know her.And the eighth of them: Al -Hasan is a light, and peace be upon him said: He said: Those who revive my Sunnah and teach them the servants of God.And the ninth: peace be upon him: “Whoever comes out asking for a door of knowledge to return it in vain to a right or a misguidance to this guidance, his work as a servant of four years.” And I adore it: Peace be upon him, may God bless him, when he sent him to the right, ““ God guides you with a single man who is better for you, which is what you are upset.” The one is twenty: Ibn Masoud is a marvelous.The second is ten: the age of Al -Jahni is a mourning.The third is the tenth: the father of the one who is the one who is al -Laithi: The other is the success of their successors, and the third is He returned and escaped, and when he emptied peace be upon him, he said: I tell you about the three alienation.As for the third: He was shown from God, and God was presented to him.“It was narrated by Muslim.* * * As for the antiquities, it is one of the faces: (a) The scientist is more likely from the father and the mother; Because parents and mothers keep it from the fire of the world and its pests, and the scholars keep it from the fire of the hereafter and its adversity.(B) It was said to Ibn Masoud: What did you find this science?He said: With a question, a heart is a mind.(C) Some of them said: Ask the question of the beard, and keep the preservation.(D) Musab ibn Al -Zubayr said to his son: O sons, you know the knowledge, so if you have money, the knowledge of you was beautiful, and if you have no money, you have money.(E) Ali Bin Abi Talib said: There is no best in the silence on the basis of knowledge, as there is no best in talking about ignorance.(F) Some investigators said: The scholars are three scholars (P-167) in God, it is not a scholar of the command of God, and a scholar of God is unknown to God, and God is the best of God.As for the first: it is a servant who has been the divine definition on his heart, so he became angry with the witness of the light of the majesty and the grace of the old people, so there is no Judgments are only inevitable.The second: He is the one who is a scholar of the command of God and other than a scholar of God, and he who recognized the permissible, the forbidden, and the truths of the rulings, but he does not know the righteousness of the majesty of God.As for the scholar of God and the rulings of God, he is sitting on the shared limit between the minds of the minds and the world of the worlds And mercy, then if he returns from his Lord to creation, he becomes with them as one of them as if he does not know God, and if he is removed with his Lord, he is disturbed by his remembrance, and he is not.The path of the messengers and the two friends, and this is what is meant by his saying, peace be upon him: The scholars, “That is, the scholars of the command of God, are not the worlds of God, so he commanded their misfortunes when the pilgrim to God is average from them, but the rule is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not know The rules of God commanded their mixtures, and the great ones are the scientists of God and the rulings of God, so he commanded their virtues; Because in that seller, the benefits of the world and the hereafter, then the slit of the brotherhood said: Each one of these three three signs, but the scholar of the command of God, has three signs: Male with the tongue without the heart, and that it is a disagreement from creation without the Lord, and that he will be ashamed of people in the apparent and not be ashamed of God in the secret, and for the sake of God.Male Repeated disagreement.As for the remembrance, the remembrance of the heart is not the remembrance of the tongue.By God and the command of God, he has six things, the three that we mentioned to the scholar of God, only with three of the last three: the one who is sitting on the one And the world of martyrdom, and its universe is a teacher of the first two sections, and its essence is in terms of the first two of the two parties to him while he seeks me from them, then he said: Like the sun, it does not increase or decrease, and the like of the scholar with God only, like the like the moon completes a time The larva burns itself and turns to others.(G) He said, "Was Al -Mawasil So the heart, if the knowledge, the thought and the wisdom are forbidden to die.(H) The slit of Al -Bakhi said: People are from my Majlis on three types: a categorical, and a purely hypocris So I say about God and about the Messenger, so whoever does not believe me, he is a purely infidel, and whoever narrows his heart from him, then he is a pure hypocris Structural believer.And he also said: Three of the day is hated by God Almighty, and three of the laughter: the sleep after the prayer of the dawn and before the prayer of the domain, and the ritual in the prayer, and the rituals, And the laughing is the successor of the funeral, the laugh in the graves, and the laugh in the field of remembrance.“ Heaven, as well as science, descends from the sky.The second: As the land is given to the rain, the creation of creation is with knowledge.The third: Just as the plant and the plants do not come out without the rain, as are the work and the obstacles that do not come out of knowledge.And the lord: Just as the rain is the rail of the throat and the lightning, as is the science, then it is the horror of the promise and the bastard.Fifth: Just as the rain is a foolish and a harmful, as well as the knowledge is a fool (P-168) and a harm: a fool of those who do it is harmful to those who did not work with it.(J) How many people are of God, people of God, and how many of God is good for God, and how much from God is far from God Suffering from the verses of God.(Oh) The world is two signs, which are decorated with five things: the knowledge of scholars, the justice of the princes, the worship of worshipers, the honesty of merchants, and the advice of the people.فَجاءَ إبْلِيسُ بِخَمْسَةِ أعْلامٍ فَأقامَها بِجَنْبِ هَذِهِ الخَمْسِ جاءَ بِالحَسَدِ فَرَكَزَهُ في Sincerely, and he came with the neighbor, so he focused it on the authority of the justice, and came with the innocence, so he focused it on the authority of worship, and it came with stencils, so he focused on the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the safety, The advice.(Yep) Al -Hasan Al -Basri preferred over the two followers with five things: the first: it was not commanded by one thing until his work.The second: It was not forbidden for anything until it was forbidden.The third: Everyone who asked him for something that God has gave up, may God bless him, did not redeem him with knowledge and money.And the four: He used to seek his knowledge of people, and the fifth: his secret and his advertisements were both.(Y) If you want to know that your knowledge will benefit you or not, then ask for five qualities: the love of poverty for the few found, and the love of the obedience is a request for the sake Request for emptiness, love of wisdom, asking for the heart of the heart, and the love of the cell in order to seek the path of the Lord.(يد) اطْلُبْ خَمْسَةً في خَمْسَةٍ, الأوَّلُ: اطْلُبِ العِزَّ في التَّواضُعِ لا في المالِ والعَشِيرَةِ.The second: to ask the wealth in the mask, not in the many.The third: to ask for security in paradise, not in the world.And the fourth: asking the spare in the minority, not in the many.And the fifth: the demand for the benefit of knowledge in the work, not in the many novel.(Yah) Ibn al -Mubarak said: What came to the corruption of this nation except by the properties, and they are five: the scholars, the invaders, the mud: the merchants, and the governors.As for the scholars, he understands the heirs of the prophets, and the Baghdad is the intention of the people of the earth.If the scholar of the debt is a weak and the talisman is lifted, then whoever does the ignorance does?And if the ascetic in the world is a desire, then whoever repents the repentance?And if the gas is a mirror, so how to blow up the enemy?And if the merchant is treacherous, how is the safety?And if the shepherd is a wolf, how to get the patronage?(U) Ali ibn Abi Taleb, may God be pleased with him, said: The knowledge is better than money in seven aspects: the first: the science is the inheritance of the prophets, and the money is the inheritance of the parties.The second: The science does not decrease in the hypocrisy and the money is decreased.The third: the money needs the preservation and the knowledge keeps its owner.And the lord: If a man dies, his money remains, and the science will enter with his owner, his grave.And the fifth: the money gets the believer and the infidel, and the science is only to the believer.The sixth: all people need the owner of knowledge in the matter of their religion, and they do not need the owner of the money.The seven: The science strengthens the man on the one who is on the path, and the money is forbidden.(Yaz) Al -Fakih said, Abu al -Laith: Whoever is sitting with the scientist and is not able to keep from that science something, he has seven dignity: the first: the first: The second: as long as he was sitting with him, he was loved by sins.The third: if it comes out of its homes Request for knowledge, the mercy came down to it.And the lord: If he is sitting in the throat of knowledge, then if the mercy comes down to them, he will get a share of it from it.And the fifth: as long as it is in obedience, it is written for him.And the sixth: If he heard and does not understand his heart, his deprivation is narrowed by the realization of knowledge, then that grief will become a way for him to the presence of God Almighty; لِقَوْلِهِ عَزَّ وجَلَّ: ”أنا عِنْدَ المُنْكَسِرَةِ قُلُوبُهم لِأجْلِي“.And the seven: He sees the condolences of the Muslims to the scientist and humiliates them for immorality, so he wants his heart (P-169) from immorality and tends his bowl to science; For this, he commanded him to pray and peace be upon him.* * * (Yah).Something from his right is an angry, for that in the second blessing of the fire, and from the scholars who make his hadith and his knowledge of his knowledge of the people Awel, that is in the third blessing of the fire, and from the scholars who were admired by itself if he preaches an excess of it, and if it is a nose, then that in the righteous blessing.Among the scholars who sets itself to Fitia, then it is a mistake, so that in the fifth blessing of the fire, and from the scholars who know the words of the abundant, then the words The sixth blessing of the fire, and from the scholars who asks for knowledge of the people of the people, is in the way that is four of the fire.(Yatt) Al -Fakih said, Abu Al -Laith: Whoever is sitting with eight types of people from the people increased by God, the eight of the things, whoever is sitting with the songs increased by God, the love of God, and the love of the world, The poor, God made him thankful and satisfied with the oath of God, and whoever is sitting with the Sultan, God increased the cruelty and arrogance, and whoever is sitting with the people of God, and the God of God, and the goodness, The more of the fun and the joking, and the one who sat with the immorality, increased from the jewelry on the sins and the arrival of the repentance, and whoever is sitting with the righteous, and the righteousness of the righteous, and the righteousness of the righteous, and the righteousness of the righteousness, Scholars are the greater science and the pious.(Yi) God taught seven seven things: (a) Adam taught the names and taught Adam all the names.(B) He taught the greenness and taught it from our knowledge [Al -Kahf: 65].(C) He taught Yusuf the science of expressions, Lord, I have given me from the king and taught me from the interpretation of the hadiths [Yusuf: 101].(D) He taught David the breasts of the dance and taught it to the obsession of a pulp for you [the Prophet: 80].(H) Solomon taught the bird of the bird, O people, we taught us the brightness of the bird [Al -Nimal: 16].(F) Jesus, peace be upon him, taught the knowledge of Al -Tawara and Al -Najil and teach it the book, wisdom, Al -Tawara and Al -Najil [Al -Amran: 48].(G) He taught Muhammad ﷺ The legitimacy and the jurisprudence, and your knowledge of what you did not know [the women: 113], and teach them the book and wisdom [the cow: 129], the mercy of the Qur’an [1].The knowledge of Adam was a reason for him in the acquisition of the prostration and the greeting, and the knowledge of the vegetables was a reason for that he found a student like Moses and was shining on them, and the knowledge of peace, and the knowledge of peace The people and the kingdom, and the knowledge of David was a reason for the presence of the righteousness and the grace, and the knowledge of Solomon was a reason for the presence of the measles and the dominance, and the knowledge of Jesus was the reason His mother, and the knowledge of Muhammad ﷺ was a reason for the exodus of the intercession, then we say: Whoever knows the names of the creatures and finds the greeting from the angels, so who knows the same Greetings to the angels?Rather, he finds the saliva of the Lord a peace from the Lord of the Most Merciful [Yass: 58] and the green and found the knowledge of the chairs.The companions of Muhammad ﷺ are those with those who have blessed God from the Prophet With the interpretation of the book of God, how does it not escape from the love of desires and guides those who will come to a straight path [Yunus: 25] and also, if it is the best of peace be upon him, peace be upon him.Where he said: He taught me from the interpretation of the hadiths [Yusuf: 101].You, O scientist, do you not remember the grace of God for your soul, where you know your interpretation?What is the grace of what God gave you?!Where he made you an informative of his words, called himself, and inherited his Prophet, farewell to his creation, preaching to his worshipers, and a pleasure for the people of his family His paradise and his rewards, and a mourning for them for his fire and his punishment, as he came in the hadith: “The scholars are a pioneer, and the jurisprudence is leaders, and their sitting is an increase.” (Ka) Six qualities of himself.One of them: to say: God (P-170) commanded me to perform the exhibits, and I do not appreciate its performance except by knowledge.The second: to say: We are forbidden from the tinkers and I do not appreciate their genius except by knowledge.The third: It is the highest of it, and it is not possible for me to thank it, and it is not able to do it except with knowledge.And the four: He commanded me fairness of creation, and I am not able to describe them except with knowledge.And the fifth: that God commanded me with patience with his family, and I am not able to do it except with knowledge.And the sixth: that God commanded me to be hostility with the Satan and I am not able to do it except with knowledge.(Kab) The way of paradise in the hands of four: the scholar, the guidance, the worshiper, and the direction, then the guidance if he is true in his claim, God bless him, and the worshiper if he is the one who is in his claim Fear, and the jurisprudence if he is honest in his claim that God bless him Judgment.(Kaj) I ask four of four: from the place of peace, and from the owner of the honorable, from the empty money, and from the good knowledge, then if you do not find it, then it does not find it It is better than it, and if you do not find the dignity of your owner, the dog is better than it, and if you do not find from the money of the emptiness, then the length is better than it, and if you do not find the knowledge of it, then the knowledge is not.(Keep) Four things do not complete except by four things: religion does not fulfill except by piety, and the saying is only fulfilled by verb By doing, the religion is not strengthened by danger, and the saying without action, such as the risk, and the vagina with no humility such as a tree without fruits, and knowledge without a work.(Ke) Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, said to Babir Bin Abdullah Al -Ansari: The Blind of the World with four with a scholar who does his knowledge, does not know, A rich who does not spare his mind, and a poor person who does not sell his end with his minimum, if the scholar does not work with his knowledge, he will stop the ignorance of his knowledge, and if he knows the ritual Its last of its world, the night is for them, and the 3 seven times.(Ko) The Khalil said: The men are four men who know, and he knows that he knows, so he is a scholar, so follow him, and a man who knows and does not know that he knows, so he is a sleeping, and he does not wake him up.He knows, so he is a guided, so they guided him, and a man does not know, and he does not know that he does not know, so it is a Satan, so they will avoid it.(Kz) Four does not want to the evil one to be exhausted from it, even if it is a prince: his resurrection is from his soul to his father, and his servant of his guest, and his servant of his guest, From it, the question is a blind person who does not know who is knowledgeable of it.(Kah) If the scholars occupy the halal gathering, the pity becomes eaten for young people, and if the scientist becomes eaten for young people, the public becomes eaten for the forbidden, and if the scholar becomes a food for the sacrifice It means if they turn.As for the minds of the minds, it is one: one of them is that the affairs are on four sections, a section that is satisfied with the mind and does not satisfy the lust, and the division of the ritual, and the ritual of the shame, A division is satisfied by the mind and lust together, and an oath that is not satisfied with the mind and does not accept desire.As for the first: it is the diseases and the convergence in the world.وأمّا الثّانِي: فَهو المَعاصِي أجْمَعُ.As for the third: it is knowledge.As for the lord: it is ignorant, so the science comes from the ignorance of the house of paradise from the fire, so the mind and the desire are not satisfied with the fire, so they are not.They are satisfied with paradise, so they are satisfied with knowledge.(P-171) It is said to him: The place is used in paradise, so enter Heaven, and whoever is satisfied with ignorance is said to him: the fire is used to the fire, and the fire is entered, and it indicates that the science is a paradise, and the ignorance is a fire that is like the pleasure of the heart, and it is in the heart of the heart, The distance from the love, and the surgery is a pain; Because it excludes a part of the body from a loved one from those parts, which is the pleasure, when the surgeon was required to remove that gossip, then it is necessary to remove it.And after him, there was no generosity that was a painful, and burning with the fire was more painful than the wound; Because the wound is only beneficial to a specific part of a specific part, but the fire is divided into all the parts, so it is required to distance the whole part of the parts Some, when the separatism was more severe, the pain was the most difficult, but the pleasure is a phrase for the realization For an agreement to body, and so is the pleasure of view, but it gets; Because the visionary power is derived from the perception of the visions, then there was no generosity of that perception of it, so he appeared in this way that the pleasure is a reflection of the perception of the perception of the The perception of the deceased, and if you know this, then say: the more the perception is more and more severe, and the blessed is honored and completed, and the one is the one who is left and the one who will be burdened, and it is necessary.There is no doubt that the person of knowledge is the spirit and it is an honorable of the body, and there is no doubt that the mental awareness is the most dominant and honorable of what will come to his two people in the interpretation of the saying [Al -Nur: 35].As for the information, he does not doubt that he is honored; Because he is God, the Lord of the two worlds, and all his creatures from the angels, the corrupt, the supporters, the compacts, the plants, and the animals, and all its rulers, its people, its affliction, and the one of it, It was proven that it is not like a blame, nor the pleasure above the fullness of knowledge and its pleasure, nor a row, nor do we say, above the naughty of ignorance and its shortness of it, and what is what is said, From us on a scientific question, then if you know it and appreciate the answer and the rightness in it, he rejoiced with that and brought it up with it, and if it is ignorant of it, it is not the shame of it, Coop with knowledge is the most complete of the pleasures, and the misery with ignorance is the most complete types of misery.* * * Know that here we are more than the texts that indicate the virtue of science, we forgot to reiterate it before that, so we will remember it.The first face: that the first of what was revealed by the Almighty: Read in the name of your Lord, who created the creation of the human being from the relationship, read and your Lord is the one who knows the knowledge He knows [Al -Alaq: 1 - 5] and he said in it: It is necessary from the sponsorship of the appropriateness between the verses.The generosity He who knew about the pen and answered that the face of the appropriateness is that he was the first to mention the first state Repeal the paths, as if he was upset, he said: You were in the first situation in that path that is the end of the traitors, and you have become at the end of your condition in this path that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in this way that is the end, and this is what is It would be fulfilled, even if the knowledge was honored, if it was not honored, it would be the remembrance of that thing in this place.The second: He said: Read and your Lord, who knows the pen and has been established in the origins of jurisprudence that the ruling is on the authority It is his pursuit and the Almighty, but he deserved the description of the generosity; Because he had given knowledge, if not the knowledge was honored by others, otherwise it would not have benefited it from the benefit of his other.(P-172) The third: His Glory be to Him: God is afraid of his servants of the scholars, and this verse is in it, as it is the signs of the evidence of the grace of knowledge.One of it: its significance on the nations of the people of Paradise; That is because the scholars are among the people of fear, and whoever is from the people of fear was one of the people of Paradise, the scholars are among the people of Heaven, so that the scholars are among the people of the fear God is one of his servants of the scholars [Fatir: 28], and that the people of the fear of the people of Paradise are the words of the Almighty: their reward for their Lord is the gardens of the Garden 8] To his words of exalted: That is for those who fear his Lord [the evidence: 8], and it is also indicated by the saying of the Almighty: and for those who fear the shrine of his Lord, two gardens: His Excellency said: “And my dear, and my majesty, I do not collect on my servants, and I will not have two years.The resurrection “and know that it can be proven by this significance in the mind, but that the scholar is that the scientist with God must fear him, so he is not for you, so that he is not a scholar, so that he is not a scholar It is impossible to be a disagreement from him, then the knowledge of the self is not enough for fear, but it must have knowledge of three matters: the knowledge of the power; Because the king is a scholar of his patronage on his ugly deeds, but he does not fear them for his knowledge that they are not able to pay it, and from it: Because the thief of the money of the Sultan knows his ability, but he knows that he is not a scientist with his steadfastness, so he does not fear him, and he is the knowledge of it Sultanate is a scholar of the form of the Sultanate, who is able to prevent him from a scholar of his actions, but he knows that he may be satisfied with what he does not want, so he does not have a good The Sultan is on the openings of his actions and his ability to prevent him and know It is a wise person who does not satisfy his recovery; These three scientists became due to the fact that fear is in his heart, so you have proven that the fear of the servant from God does not get unless he knows that he is a scholar of the scholar Performed on all the destinations, not satisfied with the prohibitions and prohibitions, so you have proven that fear is from the boundaries of the knowledge of God, but we said: The fear is that If he will be given to the servant, there is an urgent pleasure, and that pleasure is on the dispute of the command of God, and the action of that thing will be a disgraceful and harmful By the righteousness of the righteous side on the side, then if he knows the light of faith that the urgent pleasure is a wise in the metaphor of the later pain, then that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The urgent pleasure, and that is the fear, and if it becomes a softening for the outgoing, an effective for the duty, it was one of the people of the reward, then it was established with the sacrifices of the sake of the sake of the sake of the mind Check, and the disagreement is from the people of paradise.And the second: that the appearance of the verse indicates that it is not for the family of the people except the scholars, and that is because the word (but) is for the confusion, so this is indicated that it does not For the scholars, and the second verse, which is his saying: That is for those who fear his Lord [the evidence: 8] indicating that paradise is for the people of fear, and its cousin for the people of the people كَوْنَها لِغَيْرِهِمْ, فَدَلَّ مَجْمُوعُ الآيَتَيْنِ عَلى أنَّهُ لَيْسَ لِلْجَنَّةِ أهْلٌ إلّا العُلَماءَ, واعْلَمْ أنَّ هَذِهِ الآيَةَ فِيها تَخْوِيفٌ شَدِيدٌ, وذَلِكَ لِأنَّهُ ثَبَتَ أنَّ The fear of God is up to the boundaries of the knowledge of God.He is the one who inherits the fear, and that the types of arguments, and if they were poured and closed if they were given the benefit of fear, were from the flags of the slander.(P-173) and its third: Reading, but God is afraid of His servants of the scholars [Fateer: 28] with the first raises and the second stabilization, and the meaning of this reading: that it is the Almighty, The scholars did not fear; Because they are those who distinguish between what is permissible and between what is not permissible, and the ignorant who does not distinguish between these two chapters, so what is it in it and what is it?In this reading, the end of the position of the scholars and the glorification.Al -Rabaa: His Excellency said: Say, Lord, increase me knowledge [Taha: 114].In it, there is evidence of the breath of knowledge and the most prominent of it and the excess of the love of God Almighty, when he commanded his Prophet to the hardships of him, and he said: One of the knowledge is to be satisfied with the Prophet of God, Moses, peace be upon him, and he did not say: Do I follow you on you to teach me what you have learned as a rationale [Al -Kahf: 66].Fifth: Salman had peace be upon him from the king The world was not even that he said, Lord, forgive me, gave me a king who does not want anyone after me [p.35], then he did not choose the kingdom, and he said: People taught us the brightness of the good and we have given us from everything.It is good for the believer to choose the knowledge of the Lord of the two worlds, he was better, and because he came to him on his saying: We have given us from everything [16] He mentioned the same condition, the knowledge was presented first, and he said: And he said that he is ruled in the plow [the Prophet: 78] He mentioned after that, what is related to the worlds of the world, and it indicated that the knowledge was honored.The sixth: Some of them said: The guidance is with the end of the weak, and with the fact that it was in the standing of the crucifixion, he said to Selman: The honor of the things, otherwise, from where is the guidance to speak in the sitting of Solomon with the same as this words, and for that the man is seen if he learns to know.The sultans, and that is nothing but the blessing of science.The seven: The prayers and peace be upon him: “A good hour thinks of the worship of six years.” The reward of God Almighty, and who connects you to God is better than what God will reach you.The second: that thinking is the work of the heart, the obedience is the work of the wounds, and the heart is honored by the wounds, so the work of the heart was honored by the work of the wounds, and the one who affirms this Exalted: I am God [Taha: 14] He made the prayer and a way to mention the heart, and the intended is honored by the liquid, so it indicated that the knowledge is more honorable.The eighth: The Almighty said: He taught you what you did not know [the women: 113], and the best of God was great upon you [the women: 113], so the knowledge is great, and the name is great.The governance is the knowledge, and he also said: The Most Merciful teach the Qur’an [Al -Rahman: 1 - 2] So he made this grace presented to all of the blessings, so it is a good thing.The ninth: that the man of the books of God is a delegate with the best of knowledge.And I wanted to forgive him and learn it, then work with it, then make it up to obtain it as my honor in the world and the hereafter.(P-174) The sons of Israel and their doves are severe, they spoke from the people of fear, so if you did not find them, then they spoke to the scholars, so if you did not find a scientist So they spent the minds, because the fear, knowledge and mind are three times what I have made one of them in one of my creation and I want his destiny.There is no knowledge of knowledge, as we have indicated that fear is only with knowledge, and the Sufis of the two things is honored by the Sufis with one thing, and this is the same The sane person; The four of it is one of it.He did not harden you, and if he did not raise you, he did not put you, and if he did not sing you, he did not comply with you, and if he did not benefit you, he did not harm you, and do not say: We are afraid that we will not know, and we do not know, and we do not know that we do not know We hope that we know and do “and the knowledge is a lip of his friend and a right to God Almighty not to disgrace him, God Almighty says:“ What do you think?” They say: We thought that he would be merciful and forgive us, and he says: I have done, I have been rejected by my rule, not for you, I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, but I wanted you, So enter the righteousness of my servants to my paradise with my mercy.“The fighter bin Soliman said: I found in the Gospel: that God Almighty said to Jesus, the son of Maryam, and the Lord of them: They preferred them, because I preferred them to all of the prophets and the messengers as the righteousness * * * As for the news: (a) on the authority of Abdullah ibn Umar, he said: “Prayer and peace be upon him said: God says,“ Excellency the scholars Paradise on what was from you.He learned the knowledge and put in the knowledge and taught it to the servants of God, he wants what is in God, and he was not in heaven that is more rewarding than him, nor the greatest of the jungle, and no A precaution is an excuse, unless he has the rituals of the share and the honor of the homes.It is anchored by the paths, rubies, and the murderer, the majesty of the Sunnah and the grace, then the call of the Most Merciful is called: Where is the one who carried it to the nation of Muhammad, the knowledge of it On these leaflets, then they are not afraid of you until they enter Heaven.”(D) on the authority of Jesus, Ibn Maryam, peace be upon them: that the nation of Muhammad is upon him And peace is the scholars of rulers, as if they are from the jurisprudence, a prophet, who are satisfied with God with the easy one of the livelihoods, and God is satisfied with them with the easy one of the work, and he enters the garden.(H) Peace be upon him said: “Whoever dusts his feet in the request of knowledge, God forbids his body on the fire, and he forgive him for his king Heaven is the garden, and he expands for him in his grave, extending his eyes, and enlightened his neighbors, four four graves on his right, and four of his graves, and he is a grave from his family, Forty in front of him, the world of the scientist is worshiper, and his doctrines are praise, and his soul is charity, and every country has come out of his eyes, and he is from the sake He insulted the knowledge, and whoever insulted the science has insulted the Prophet, and whoever insulted the Prophet has insulted Jabriel, and whoever insulted Jabril insulted God, and whoever insulted God.(F) He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Do I not tell you about the generation of horses?They said: Yes, O Messenger of God, he said: God is the highest horses, and I am the best of Adam, and their grandfather after me is a man of a scientist who publishes his knowledge, so he will be a mother, and the mother of the mother, And a man is ready in the way of God until he is killed.(G) On the authority of Abu (P-175), Harra, Marifa, “Whoever breathes from a believer is a distress from the Lord of the world.May God be pleased with him in the world and the hereafter, and God Almighty is in the eyes of the servant as long as the servant is in the eyes of his brother A people gathered in a mosque from the mosques of God, they recite the book of God, and they will be taught among them, unless the knife came down to them, and the mercy of them, and the mercy of them, and the mercy of them.The angels, and God reminded them of those who have it.(H) The prayers and peace be upon him said: “The day of the resurrection intercede three: Al -Rawi said: The greatest arrangement is a mediator between the prophecy and the testimony.(I) Mu'taz ibn Jabal: The prayers and peace be upon him said: And his knowledge is a charity, and his vigor for his family is a closeness.The evidence is on the secrets and the harm, the weapon is on the elders, and the debt is when the difference is raised by God with the righteousness of it, so he will make them in the goodness of the guidance of the guidance, and it is a guidance, and it will be lost.With their effects, and they are imitated by their acts, and it is ended in their views, the angels desire their creation and their wings, their wipes, and in their prayers, and in their prayers, they will be forgiven Wet and dress, And the whales of the sea, its wives, the seventh of righteousness, its tranquility, the sky and its stars; Because science is the life of hearts from the blindness and the light of the eyes of the darkness, the power of the eternity from the weakness is attained by the domesticity of the free and the sitting of the mortality and the rituals of the downs.And thinking about it is adjusted by fasting, and its departure by doing it with God obeys and worshiped, and with it it is glorified and united, and with it the connection of the womb, and with it.(J) Abu Hurairah: He said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: (Oh) He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “If you ask the neighborhood, then ask the people, it was said: O Messenger of God and from the people?He said: The people of the Qur’an, it was said: Then who?He said: The people of science, it was said: Then who?He said: The lamp is the face.Al -Rawi said: What is meant by the people of the Qur’an is the one who preserves his suffering (Yob), peace and blessings be upon him, said: And the succession of his Messenger, and the world, the poison of God, fighting for His servants, so they took from it the amount of poison in the medication, so that you may survive.Because they say: This is a forbidden, so they avoid it, and this is permissible, so they took it.(Y) in the news: The scientist is a prophet who was not inspired by it.(Hand) The prayers and peace be upon him said: “Be a scholar, a learner, a luminous, or a lover, and do not be the fifth, so you will be over.” * * * Al -Rawi said: The face of the success is between this narration, and among the other narration, which is the saying of peace and blessings be upon him: The best of them is that “the listed and the loved one is the teacher of the learner, and the best said some of the Arabs to his son: be a virtuous seven, or a wolf, or a wolf, And to be a deficient human being.(Yah), peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Whoever is on the hands of his hand is a scholar who wrote to God for him with every step that fears a nickname.Good.(Yu) He, peace and blessings be upon him, said in the wow of Abu Hurairah: He agreed, and a scientist who is playing with ignorance.(Yaz), peace be upon him, said: “The Qur’an is the custom of the people of Paradise, the rituals of the leaders of the people of Heaven, and the prophet is the pillow of the people of Paradise.” (May, peace be upon him, said: “The scholars are the keys to paradise and the intelligence of the prophet.” (P-176) Al-Rawi said: The human being is not a key, but the meaning is that they have the knowledge of the conquest Knowledge of religion.(Yatt) said to him Prayer and peace: “God has a higher day for every day and night a thousand mercy on all of his heedless creation, the richest and the most beautiful of the rituals, so the bonds and the mercy of the The scholars and the students of the science and the Muslims, and the one mercy of the people of the people.(K) And peace and blessings be upon him and peace be upon him: “I said, Jabriel, which of the work is better for my nation?He said: Knowledge, I said: Then any?He said: The view of the scientist, I said: Then any?He said: The Ziyyah of the scholar, then he said: Whoever has the knowledge of God and wanted him with the goodness of himself and the goodness of the Muslims, and he did not return it with a display of the world.(Ka), peace and blessings be upon him, and peace be upon him: “A tenth is the preacher: the scholar, the learner, and the owner of the good of creation, the sick, the hill, the gase For the Muslims, the obedient father of his father, and the obedient woman of her husband “(Kab)” “The Prophet’s question ﷺ What is the knowledge?And he said: The deed is the work, it was said: What is the mind?He said: The leader of the good, it was said: What is the passion?He said: Marking the sins, it was said: What is the money?He said: The people of the older are called, it was said: What is the world?He said: The last market.(Kaj) “He, peace and blessings be upon him, was making a person, and God revealed to him: He did not remain from the age The Messenger is with that, so the man was obliged, and he said: O Messenger of God, show me the success of my work for me in this hour, he said: He occupies the learning, and he did not know.Morocco".Al -Rawi said: If only if something is better than knowledge, the Prophet’s command ﷺ was in that time.(He said) The prayers and peace be upon him: “The people are all my death except the scholars.” And the news is famous.(Ke) on the authority of Anas, peace and blessings be upon him said: A companion, or left a good son who calls for him good, or a charity that will run for him after his death.Because he is spiritual, and the spirituality remains one of the gestures.(Ko) The prayers and peace be upon him said: “Do not sit with scholars unless they call you from five to five: from doubt to the peat, and from the oldest to the humor, and from the enemy, from the ritual to the rituals, and from the rituals to the rituals, and from the rituals to the ritual, and from the ritual to the rituals, and from the rituals to the And from the desire to asceticism, ““ Kz) ”or the prophet ﷺ to Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, and he said: O Ali, keep the al -Tawahid, for it is my money My letters, and make the prayer, for it is the village of my eyes, and remember the Lord.(Kah) Abu Kabbah Al -Ansari said: “The Messenger of God was struck by us.Knowledge and gave him money, so he works with his knowledge in his money, and a man gave him a knowledge and did not give him money, and he says: If God, the Exalted, is like what is the same, so what is the same, so what is the same, so what is the same.So and so do so, so they are in the reward, and a man who has been given to God, and he did not give him knowledge, so he prevents him from the truth and spends it in falsehood, and a man who did not give him a man He says: If God Almighty, like what was given to so -and -so, I would have done in it the same as what the so -and -so do so, so they are in the minister, whether.My father is a student, may God be pleased with him, in my hand, and he brought me out to the cheese.So keep what I say to you: People are three: a Rabian scholar, and he learned to a path of survival, and a rabble gum that follows all of the righteous, they tend with every wind, and they did not Knowledge, and they did not resort to a pillar and a certainty, you, knowledge, goodness is better than money, and science prohibits you and you are prohibiting money, and money is shortened by the expense, and the knowledge is the money He goes away with his ritual, O Kamil, knowing the knowledge of a decoration that he admires (P-177) in which a person obeyed in his life, and the beauty of the limits, A government of him.And he returned to his sins, leaving his house and there is no sin on him, so do not separate the sitting of the scholars, for God did not create a rapprochement on the face of the face of the face of the face The scholars.Perhaps his knowledge of what was narrated from Nafaa ibn Al -Azraq said to Ibn Abbas: How to choose Solomon, the guidance of the request of water?Nafaa said: How can the trap gardens be covered with a sacrifice of dust, so he does not see him, but he will be seen in it.Paradise is divided into ten thousand parts, nine thousands of people, nine and nine, and you can seek from those who are mindful of God, so that this is what is the reward for God They are from the minds.An indication of the time, forgetfulness in the wilderness, and the owner of the west, two consciences in the presence, and a chest in the sitting, and a way to the elimination of the means, and the rituals of the For lies, a talisman for the evil, and a majesty The king.(G) On the authority of Al -Hassan Al -Basri: The Breast of the Perfection of the Scholars is a praise, and the writing of science and the view is in it worship, and if it is afflicted with that supply, then it is the same, so if it is the same as it The earth is the same as its light, and if he rises from his grave, the people of the group look at him, and it is said: This is a servant of the servants of God.(H) In the book of Kalila and Dumna: The right of those who are not hidden from their rights three: the scientist, the two sultanate and the brothers, for those who are afraid of the scholar, whoever is afraid of his religion With the world, the people of its world, and whoever is hidden by the brothers, the family of his hopties.(I) Suqarat said: From the virtue of knowledge that you are not able to serve you in it, as you find someone who will serve you in the birds of the things, but you will not be destroy On his negativeness of you.(J) It was said to some of the rulers: Do not look, and he was clouded, so he said: Do not hear, and the dam of his ears, so it was said: Do not speak to him To him: Do not know, and he said: I am not able to do it.(Oh) If the thief is a scientist, he does not cut his hand; Because he says: The money was and a good for me, and so the drink says: I calculated it, and so the adulterer says: I marry it, so it is not limited.(Yep) Some of them said: Revive the hearts of your brothers with the beginnings of your two as you live in the mortality and nucleus, for it is a soul that is distant from the desires and the lips of the righteous For the plants, the poet said: ؎ The ignorant before the death is a death of his family and their bodies before the graves of the graves of the grave, and if a woman does not live with the knowledge of the knowledge of God ∗∗∗ The essence is an outbreak * * * (and the joke) is from the faces: (a) disobedience to the ignorance, and its removal is not enhanced, and when the lust comes, it will be lost, and it is a liking, so it is a lik Ask forgiveness and the Satan Ghawi, and he remained in the absence of it; Because it was in ignorance.(B) The peace be upon him, when he became a king, he needed a minister, so his Lord asked about that, and Jabril said to him: Your Lord says: Do not choose except for the sole He said to Jabriel: It is how to reconcile this work with the bad condition?Jabriel said: Your Lord is appointed to that; Because he was slaughtered from you, where he said: If his vigor was from a mourning, then he lied, and he is one of the sincere) [Yusuf: 27] and the joke is that the one who was slaughtered from Joseph is upon him.His kingdom, whoever melts from the debt of the proximated proof of the proximity, how is God charity and improvement?!(C) One wanted a king of king, and the king said: He went and learned (P-178) until you reconcile my servants, so when he was prescribed to learn and tasted the knowledge of the knowledge And he said: Leave the learning, and you have become a family for my servants, and he said: I was a family for your servants when you did not see a people for your servants, and then You saw me as a people for your servants, I saw myself a family of the servants of God Almighty, and that I was thinking that the door is your door for my ignorance, and now I knew that the door is.(D) The knowledge of science is difficult for you to overpower your love for this world; Because he gave you the darkness of the eye and the hearts of the heart, and there is no doubt that the black is greater than the ritual in the word; Because the rituals are the little of the black, then if you put a darkness in your eyes a part of the world, you do not see anything, so how if you put it on the feast of all the world?(H) Hakim said: The heart is dead and its life is with knowledge, and the science is dead and its life is in the request, and the request is weak and its strength is with the administration, so if it is a person, then it will And its appearance with the debate, and if it appears in the debate, it is a sterile and we produce it with work, then if the science is married to the work of a child and a wilderness, it is not an eternal king.(And) I said a teller, O, the propaganda, enter your silence] [Al -Nmmess: 18] to his saying: They do not feel [Al -Nabil: 18] was the politics of that of the name of the name Because she knew a single question, which is the saying of the Almighty: They do not feel as if she said: Solomon is infallible and the infallible is not permissible for him to harm
