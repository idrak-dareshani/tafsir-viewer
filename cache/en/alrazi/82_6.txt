The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: O man, what has been deceived by your honorable Lord, who created you, so you have made you in any picture, what he wanted.Know that he was given it when he was informed in the first verse about the fall of the wise and the publication, it was mentioned in this verse that indicates a mind about his possibility, or on the authority of it, The generous God who is not permissible from his generosity to cut the support of his blessings from the sinners, how can he be in his honor that he does not stand up to the oppression of the darkness?.The second: that the Qadir who created this human structure and then settled and modified it, either it is said: It created it, not for the rule of it, or the ruling, for it is not.Expanding, and it is not permissible on the wise, and if it creates it for wisdom, then the rule is, either that it is domesticated to God Almighty or to the servant, and the first is the first Continue and integrity.So he appointed the second, which is that he created creation for a ruling that is given to the servant, and that wisdom is either that appears in the world or in a house only in this world.The first is invalid because the world is a house of loudness and a bunker, not the house of the integrity and the penalty, and when all of that prolonged it, it is necessary that this house must be then from the house With the existence of the generous God who is able to create, equit, and numbness, the sane person must be cut off by his picnics, and he will be broken, The admission to the number of precedence and publishing, and this is the one who was mentioned in his eyes in the wall of the fig, where he said: (We have created the human being in the best of the one who said: It deny you after the debt [fig: 7] and this need is reconciled with the Arabs who were coupled with compulsions and denounced the return, and it is good for those who are.And the return together, because the modified creation is indicated by the compulsions and with its mediation indicates the validity of the saying of the good and the publication, then it was said: this is a building: this is the one who is the one who is the same Therefore, he said in the surah of the fig after this reciprocate: Is God not the ruling of the rules [Al -Teen: 8], so he had to say in this surah: The generosity must be wise, because the delivery of the grace to others if it was not based The ruling is that it is called a generosity, if this is proven, then it is said: It is a generous, indicating the fell of the freshener from the faces of it, as it is decided, as it is, as it is.On the fate of the h in this second direction, it was the remembrance of the generous, here is the first of the remembrance of the wise.(O man), then say: One of them: It is the infidel, because it was said after that: all, but you lie to the religion and said a gift from Ibn Abbas: I descended in Al -Walid ibn Al -Mughair, and he said: It was descended in Ibn al-Assad ibn Kaldah ibn Asid, and that is that he was beaten (P-73) the Prophet, so God Almighty did not punish him, and this verse was revealed.And the second saying: that all the sticks are the closeness, because the causes of the captivity do not praise in the generalities of the word.As for his saying: What has been deceived by your generous Lord, what is meant by you who deceived you and asked you the falsehood until you left the duties and came to the forbidden, and the meaning is what is from the So, if the warning is safe from his face with him that he is not safe, and he is like his saying: He will not be deceived by God with the deceitful [Luqman: 33].The disobedience, but if we carry it on the infidel, the meaning is what it called for the infidels and the norm by the messengers, and the denials of the evil and the publication, and here we are asking: The human being, with his generosity, with the mind of the one who is mindful and the one who is mindful, is that the quality is the benefit of what he is overwhelmed, not for mosquitoes, so when the truth was the Almighty, it was not a matter of release, and it was not the same Likewise, the obedience of the obedient, and the disobedience of the sinners, and this requires the deception; Because it is far from the richness of the weakening of the weakening from the same in the first place.So look, if he is in the door, he said to him: Why didn't you answer me?He said: I have confidently with your dream, and I am safe from your minds, so he improved his answer, and he met him, and they also said: From the generosity of the man, the literature of his pride is that he is the same With it, how to make it here, what is forbidden by it?And the answer: From his faces: one of them: that the meaning of the verse is that when you saw the dream of God on his creation, you thought that this is because there is no account or a house except for this The deception, and brought you up to the denial of precedence and publication?If your Lord is generous, it is for his generosity and does not hurry with the sanctuary simply in the period of repentance, and delayed for the parts until the people gathered in the house that made it to the house, which made it to the house, It is the one that leaves the urgent with the punishment for the sake of generosity, and that does not require the abuse that it is not a house after this house.And the second: that his generosity when he was reached to where he is not forbidden from the disobedient of his kindness, so that he will rise to the anger from the oppressor, it was the first, so then, then it is a matter The most severe fear is from this advertisement, and the conjunction and the abuse.And the third of it: that the abundance of generosity requires grandfather and dowry in the servitude and the imminent from the deception and the heavily.And its seed: some people said: He said: With your good Lord Let this be an answer to that question until he says that you will be deceived by your generosity, and if not for your generosity, I would not have done; Because you saw, you went, and you were able, and you are not, and this answer is valid if it is what is meant by his saying: Oh, the human being is not the infidel.The second question: What is the interpreter mentioned in this calamity?We said: Wajoh: One of them: Qatada said: The grace of Ibn Adam was the one who is Satan for him.And the second: Al -Hasan said: He deceived his foolishness and his ignorance.And the third of it: A fighter said: He deceived him, the forgiveness of God from him when he did not punish him at the beginning of his command, and it was said: For the one who is Bin Ayad, if God bless you, and he said: What are you saying?He said: I say that you are deceived by the relaxed.The third question: What is the meaning of the readers of Said ibn Jubayr?We said: It is either as a matter of admiration, or on the understanding of your saying, the man is deceived, then he is a laurel if he is overlooked, and whoever says that the enemy, and they are the ones who are slaughtered, and they are the ones who are overwhelmed, His Excellency said: He who created you, know that he was upset when he described himself with the generosity.First: creation, which is his saying: He who created you and does not doubt that he is generous and exerted because the existence is better (p-74) of the numbers, and life is better than the death, which is the one who said: You were a mother, so I will give you [Al -Baqarah: 28].And the second: His saying: (So you are), that is, he made you together, the name of the members of the members, hear and see it, and its counterparts say it: I disbelieved from the one who created you from the one who created you A man has been settled [the cave: 37].The noon said: He whatever you are mocked for you, the formations are all, and what made you make sure that something is from it, then you will be done.And your spirit is known, and he blessed faith, and honored you with the matter and the end, and preferred you over many of those who created a preference.And the third of it: his saying: So, in which there are two urbanization: the first search: a fighter said: He wants to change your creation in the eyes, the ears, the hands, the hands, and the man.He talked and not one of the two eyes, and he is like his saying: I am able to forget his children [the resurrection: 4] and his report is what is known in the knowledge This corpse is on the level, so that it does not differ between its descriptions, not in the bones, in its forms, nor in its dumbness, nor in the elderly, the partners, and the nerves of the window in it, and the nerves in it, and the nerves in it.And the exclusion of the saying in which he does not follow this knowledge, and a giving said about Ibn Abbas: He made you a standing standing, and the good of the image is not like the vine You create you, so I will bring you out in the best of the evaluation, and because of that accusative, make you prepare for the acceptance of the mind, power, and thought, and I will make you happy Live and plant, and connected In the midst of what the world has not reached this world.The second research: The Kufic reads, and he gave you a lightness, and there are faces in it: one of them: Abu Ali Al -Farisi said: The meaning is that some of you are the same.And the second: Al -Farah said: I feel your modification in it and I did not know you in it, in the first reader, it was made in his saying: in any image of a link to the installation, which is good, and in the second reader, he made it.For his saying: He gathered you while he was weak, and he knew that the readers of the readers are directed at this second direction, but on the first direction, who is the one who mentioned the father of the father, the one who is the one who mentioned the father of the father, who is the one who mentioned it.Facant.The third: The lock is transferred from each other that they are two languages ​​with one meaning, but his saying: In any image, what he wants, and what is the one who is the first thing?In it, saying: The first: that it is not more, but it is in the sense of the condition and the penalty, so the meaning will be in any image, what he wants to install in it, and it is a ride in it, Righteous and fighting: The meaning, if he wants to ride you in the form of a human being from the image of a dog or a picture of a ritual or a pink or a penny.And the second saying: It is a confirmed link and the meaning in any image that his will require and his ruling from the different pictures, for it is the grace of it, and it is upon you.This saying the verse is enticed by its faces: one of it: that what is meant is from the different pictures like the father and the mother, or the relatives of the father or the relatives of the mother, and the meaning is that it is the meaning of it The same as the images of these and indicates this health is what was narrated that he was peace be upon him.He said in this verse: Adam.And the second: It is the one who mentioned the darkening and the dagge that what is meant is from the different images that contradict the calculation of length, minors, goodness, ugliness, male, and polish The chants are the one in the end of the appearance, because the sperm is a body that is similar to the parts and the effect of the two parents in it in the level, so the effect of the influence The similar one does only a single action, so when the effects and adjectives disappeared, that creatures indicate that the monitor is the foolish Qadir, the locking said: (P-75).Like the disagreement of the conditions in richness, poverty, health and fertilization, as we cut it that they were granted, but some distinguish from one in richness and poverty, and the longevity of the age, and the longevity of the age, and the longevity of the age, He surrounds her being, except for him, so we know that he made one contrary to one, in creation and colors with a language, That is because in this way of this difference, the good is distinguished from the woman and the close of the foreigners, then he said: And we are witnessing a testimony that there is no doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt that he is a doubt about it The views and bodies are only when he knew about the goodness of his servants in it, even if we are ignorant of the eyes of the righteousness.The third saying: Al -Wasiti said: What is meant is the image of the obedient and the disobedience, so it is not those who installed it on the image The shutting of the signs and their oppression, and Al -Hassan said: Some of them are those who portrayed him so that he can be used for himself, and among them is one of those who portrayed him to occupy him without him.The example of the first: that he created Adam to make him special in his righteousness and his destiny, and his soul appeared from among his beauty and majesty, and he brought him to the ritual.
