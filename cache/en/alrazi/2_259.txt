The Quranic researcher, and his words said: He said: How did you find out in the books: The first question: in it and Jahan from the readers, Abu Amr, Hamza, and Al -Kasayi, read, and the sake of the bond, Whoever tickles the approach of the exits, and whoever appears, let the two exiles, even if they are close.The second question: They gathered that this saying is God Almighty, but it was known that this speech is from God Almighty; Because that speech was counted with miracles, and because after the life he witnessed from the conditions of his life and the appearance of the weariness in his bones did not know that that is the one who has been in the past Come here.The third question: In the verse is a problem, which is that God Almighty was aware that he was dead, and he was a scholar that the dead could not be after he became alive that he had known that he had known A long or short, so that it was for any wisdom, he asked him about the amount of that time?.The answer to it: that the intended one of this question is the alert to the limits of what happened from the paranormal.As for his words, the Exalted: I met one day or some day, and he has questions: The first question: Why did this recidal?.The answer: that the dead took over the period of his death or shortened, so the situation is one of the lineage to it, and he answered with the least that he could be dead, and that he is a dead man His death was at the beginning of the day, and he said: (Day), then when he looked at the light of (P-30) the sun remains on the heads of the two grandfathers, and he said: Or one day.The second question: that when the period was one hundred years, then he said: I lived a day or some day, is this not a lie?.And the answer: that he said that according to the suspicion, and it is not a reason for this lie, and his counterpart is that he said that he said about the companions of the cave that they said: On what they were delusional and signed with them, and also the brothers of Joseph, peace be upon him, said: O our father, your son has stole Requiring the rituals of his journey.The third question: Did he know that this was the time of death because of the death, or if he did not know that, but he believed that this is the reason for the death?.The answer: The appearance is that it is that this time was the cause Thus, it is not obtained unless he knows that this time was the cause of death, and he was also witnessed either in himself or in his way of conditions indicating that this was the same.As for the saying of the Almighty: He said: Rather, you will have a hundred years * * * As for his words, he said: Look at your food and drink He did not give it to him: the first question: the readers were charged with proving the distraction in the connection from his saying: He did not enlist him and (he) [Al -Anaam: 90] [90] And (Sultan) [Al -Haqa'a: 29] and (what he is) [Al -Qariya: 10] After they agreed to prove it in the stand, so Ibn Katheer, a benefit, and Abu Umar and Ibn Amir, read All of the forefathers are by proving the distraction in the connection, and the Hamza was omitted in the connection, and the Kasayi was omitting the distraction in the connection from his saying: He did not say: [90] And it is proven in the connection in the rest, and they did not differ in his saying: I did not give his writers and did not know what his calculations [Al -Haqa'a: 25, 26] that it is a distraction in the connection.If you know this, then we say: As for the deletion, it is in its faces: one of them: that I derive his saying (he enacted him) from the Sunnah, he claimed a lot of people, that the Sunnah said: The evidence for him is that they say in the derivation from them, the people have given them the Sunnah, and the poet said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The verb from it: the man is a man's man.If this is proven, the distraction was in his saying: He did not enable it to be to the silence, not for the origin.And secondly: The one was transferred from the deceased that he said: It is permissible for the origin of a year to be a year, because they said in its minority: Sunnah, and if this is a few, then this is a little Its origin is not entertained, then the last noun was brought down, then the silence was entered upon it, when the stand on it, as it was not the basis of it Al-Bazi stood up, then the opposite was broken, and then he was entered (P-31) the silence at the stand, and he said: He did not arrest him.And the third of it: that it is not the most deserving of the words of the Almighty: from the time of the Sunnah [Al -Hijr: 26] and the Sunnah in the language is the casting, so this is the father of the father of Al -Far.It was not entertained, that is, the drink remained in his condition, and he did not turn away, and he came to him a hundred years, then he was deleted the noun and the absence of the sake of the sake قَرَّرْناهُ في الوَجْهِ الثّانِي, فَهَذِهِ الوُجُوهُ الثَّلاثَةُ لِبَيانِ الحَذْفِ, وأمّا بَيانُ الإثْباتِ فَهو أنَّ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ مَأْخُوذٌ مِنَ السَّنَةِ, والسَّنَةُ أصْلُها سَنْهَةٌ, بِدَلِيلِ أنَّهُ It is said in its minority: a Sunnah, and it is said: The palm tied in the sense of Omam The bit is not with the connection, nor when the stand.The second question: His Excellency said: It was not enacted, that is: he did not change and the origin of the meaning of which was not forgiven, that is: the Sunnah did not come to him, because the Sunnah was not.As if she did not come to him, and we were transferred from my father Ali Al -Farisi: He did not seek any: Drinking the drink.He remained in the verse two questions: The first question: that he was exalted when he said: Rather, you would have broadcast a hundred years, it was his right to remember his obstacle to what indicates that.And his saying: Look at your food and your drink, it did not enable it to not indicate that it is a hundred years, but rather it appears to appear on what he said that it was a day or a day.The answer is that the greatest suspicion is with the knowledge of the human being in the sentence that it is a similarity.He said: Rather, you will have a year To the evidence that reveals this similarity, then he said after it: and look at your life, and he saw the perpetrators, he became a thief and a bones, so he grew up.Food and drinking speeds the absence in them, and the perpetrator may remain long and great as a long time, so he saw what is not left, which is food and drink, and what remains of the rest, and it is the rest of the rest His admiration for the pot of God is exalted, and this argument is able to fall into his mind and in his heart.The second question: It is the highest remembrance of food and drink, and his saying: He did not enable him to return to drink, not to food.The answer: As the drink describes that it was not changed, as well as the food describes the food that it was not changed, not if the food is gentle, it is a hurry of the corruption, and the corruption is that it is the corruption, Fine and grapes, and his drink was the juice of grapes and son, and in the readers of Ibn Masoud, may God be pleased with him, “and look at your food, and this is your drink, it was not.” As for his words, the Almighty: and look at your life, the meaning is that he knew the length of the period of his death by that he witnessed the bones of his life as a thief, and this is not in the truth He witnessed the muds of the emerging bones alive at once, knowing that the Qadir on that is a valid that the perpetrators were died in the event The reciprocate of the bone of the life is at the long period of death, but the mill of the bones of the arch to the life of a miracle indicating the sincerity of what was heard from his saying: Al -Dahhak: The meaning of his saying is that when he revived after the death, it was an indicative of the validity of the resurrection, and he said otherwise: It was a verse because God Almighty is a young man.A shyness of the beard and the head.(P-32) As for his words, the Almighty: Let us make you a sign for people, he has indicated that what is meant by the honor, the greatest, and the promise of the high level of the religion, and the religion of the religion, With whom he died on infidels and doubt in the capacity of God Almighty.If it was said: What is the increase in waw in his saying: (Let us make you)?We said: He said Al -Farah: You entered the waw because he did after it, because if he said: And look at your life to make you a sign, it was the view of the condition, and this is a condition, and this is a condition, It is not required of this speech, but when he said: Let us make you a verse, the meaning: Let us make you a sign, so we did what we did from the faith and the life, and the example of it is the saying The verses, and say, you study [Al -Anaam: 15] and the meaning: Let them say the cherries of the verses, and so we see the wire of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to be from the one who is from And we see the rocks.As for his words, he said: He looked at the bones, so the best of those who are intended for the bones of the bones of it, because the pain is in it in the way of the kinna, and he said: The man himself, they said: He is the highness of his head and his eyes, and the rest of his body was a larger bones, so he looked at the parts of the bones of the bones Some of the bone, and he saw his life standing as he tied him when he was alive and did not eat and did not drink a hundred years, and the ability to speak to this face is: Qutdah and Al -Rabi’a and Ibn Zaid, and he has a weak for his wings: one of them: that his saying was broadcast on one day or some day, but it is met by those who do not see the effect He was sleeping on one day, but whoever witnessed the parts of a separate body, and the bones of a thorny body, so that the saying is not fulfilled.And the second: He transcended him that he addressed him and answered, so the answering must be the one who has died by God, if the death is back to all of it, then the answer is the one who is the answer To be the sentence of the person.And the third of it: that his saying: God dies a year, and then he sent him to indicate that this sentence revives and sent it.As for his saying: (How can we publish it), what is meant is reviving it, it is said: God has spread and spread it.His exalted say: He said whoever revives the bones, which is a word, say that it revives it [Yass: 78, 79] and read “we publish it” by opening the noun and the annexation of the shin.This is that with life be the simplification of the behavior, as it is as long as it is folded as long as it is dead, then if it returns, it is as if it was published after the fold, and he reads it.With the erased, the meaning is above, and the meaning we raise each other to one, and the disgust of the thing is raised, it is said that it is erupted, and it is not, and it is raised, and it is raised, and it is raised, The earth is a chaos, and it is the eruption of the woman, which is that you raise the limit of the consent of the husband, and the meaning of the verse on this reader: How do we raise it from the land, then the land is from the ground, so it is the same And we have been installed on the bone, and it was narrated from Al -Nakhi that it was He reads “we will spread it” by opening the noun and the annexation of the sheen and the Zayy, and it was directed by what the fear said that it is said: I was disgraced and brought up, that is: I raised it.The meaning of all readings is that it was the highness of the bones, some of them, until it was connected to a system, then the meat was simplified to it, and spread the arms, and the nerves, and the nerves, and the nerves, And he raised each other to the side of the bone, so all the readings will be within that.* * * Then he said: “When it was clear to him, and this is returned to what his remembrance was presented from his saying: that this God revives this, after its death (p-33) and the meaning of it: It is excluded.And the owner of the scout said: "Act" it is clear to him, "a guarantee of his estimation, so when it was revealed to him that God is on everything, he said: I know that God is upon all For the second to him, and this is in it in it, but it is correct, but that it is clear to him that the matter of death and life on the path of the testimony said: And his interpretation: I knew the view of what I knew before that recipient.He read Hamza and Al -Kisae, “Know,“ On the verge of the matter, and in it and Jahan: One of them: that when he was appointed to his soul, he said: Relax and the second: that God Almighty said: I know that God is able to be able to do all of God and indicates this health.Fair), and his saying is confirmed in the story of Abraham: Lord, how can you live the death, then he said at the end of it: He knew that God is a dear one who said: Because the matter with the thing is that it is good for the one who is commanded by it, and we are the science that has the same as his saying: So when he shows it, then the matter is for him, so the matter is for him, so the matter is for him.It is permissible, as for the news that he was permissible.
