The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: If you are removed after what the sons came to you, then know that God is dear wise and in the verse of the questions: The first, and they are two linguists, I went to me and went.The second question: it is said: it is removed from the slippery and an earthquake if its feet are attached and the clay is said, and it is said to those who are still in a state that he had: the situation is removed from it, and the name is removed from it In it, it is the row on the authority of the duty, so he said it: If you are slipped, i.E.(P-179), you made the truth and you are transgressing it, All, whoever said in the first: He is in the hypocrites, so the second, and whoever says: It is in the people of the book, so the second is, and the rest of the rest is on it.It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas: If you are removed in the prohibition of the Sabbath and the meat of the camels after what the sons came to you, Muhammad and his parts, know that God knows that God is the best of God All his actions, then this said: If you want you, O Messenger of God, we will leave every book other than your book, so God Almighty, O God [Narrow: 136].The third question: Its saying: If you have a question in it, which is that the ruling is the right thing, but it is good in the right of those who are not a disobedience to the words of the affairs, and he answered.He knew that they would be descended, but he came to this and prepared in it in order for you to have an argument for his creation.The following question: His Excellency said: If you are removed, it means that if you go away from the way you have commanded, and on this estimation, this is the way of this The warning is as it gets many, it gets a few.So the exalted on all of that is a milestone for them from the disappearance of the curriculum so that the believer will embrace the few and many of that Stripping from him, and what he did not know is from the cabinets, he does not believe in the being of punishment, which is due to him, and then it is obligatory to do so.* * * Fifth question: His Excellency said: After what the evidence came to you, all of the mental evidence and the hearing are.As for the mental evidence, it is the evidence for the things that prove the health of the Prophet Muhammad, except after its evidence; We have the knowledge of the world’s edge and its separation to a scholar who is a scholar of all information, and it is led by all of the potentials, rich in all the needs, and the same Surprisingly, magic, and science with miraculousness on honesty, all of that is from the mental structures, and as for the hearing evidence, it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same With the Sunnah, all of these signs are within the verse from where the cost of the cost does not go away at the same time All of these evidence.The sixth question: The judge said: The verse indicated that the reason for the guilt does not happen until after the Bayan and the displacement And its obtaining it, as it is not permissible for the return to those who have no power to the verb in the first place, and because the significance does not benefit from it except the first of the power, and the power is the power, With the lack of significance, and he also said: The verse indicated that the one who is considered to be brought in the evidence, not the crops of the jurisprudence from the cost, so from this direction, the verse indicates that The view and the reciprocate is the most prominent of the knowledgeable, so the saying of those who claimed that there is no argument for God to those who know and know.* * * As for His Exalted Him: Know that God is a dear wise, who has books: the first question: for a saying that he says: If you say: “So you will come up with you:“ So you will come up with what you are.” The evidence is a sign of their sin and their generosity, so how does his saying indicate: that God is dear wise on dirt and threatening.The answer: that the dear one who does not prevent his intention, and that is to obtain the amount of ability, and you have proven that he was groaning (P-180) and the Almighty is upon all the places of the whole, so he is unable Launching, then the estimation of the verse became: if you are removed after what the evidence came to you, so know that God is alert to you, and he does not prevent him from what you are from you An end in the return, because it is gathered from the fence of what the return does not collect with the remembrance of the punishment, and the father said to his son: If you are disobeyed I was able to do the intensity of my surgery, so this is the word in the mit.Displaced?قُلْنا: نَعَمْ مِن حَيْثُ أتْبَعَهُ بِقَوْلِهِ: حَكِيمٌ فَإنَّ اللّائِقَ بِالحِكْمَةِ أنْ يُمَيِّزَ بَيْنَ المُحْسِنِ والمُسِيءِ فَكَما يَحْسُنُ مِنَ الحَكِيمِ إيصالُ العَذابِ إلى المُسِيءِ فَكَذَلِكَ It is good from the delivery of the reward to the good, but this is the right to rule and close to the mercy.The second question: He who said who said that there is no duty to something before the law with this verse, he said: Because he is the most important of the guidance, and the feast of the feet, “Benate” is noticeable for all, so this indicates that the return is a result of the coming of all the structures and before the legs, it is not the same as all the signs, so that all the signs are not Al -Waed, so the garment is not decided before the law.The third question: Abu Ali Al -Jubai said: If the matter would have said that the forced it is that he is a highness who wants the fools and the infidels of the sorry and the disbelief that it is permissible for what is permissible.A wise, because whoever did the shed and wanted him, he was shed, and the shed does not be wise.The companions answered that The wise is the scientist with the homes of things; So he returns the meaning of his being, a wise man, that he is a scholar of all information, and that is not incompatible with his being, and it is not for all the things, and it is not for you, but it is not for you, but it is necessary for you to do so, but it is necessary He wanted what his numbers knew that he had wanted to do itself, and they said: If this would have been necessary, then if he commanded what he knew, he would have commanded him.We said: This is required, even if the matter was a matter of something that only fulfills it, and this has a variety of us, then if they said: If not, then it would not be, then it is not that you are not.This is a good, and God knows.The following question: It is narrated that a reader has read “Forgiving, Merciful”, so he heard him Arab, and he denied it, and he said: If this is the words of God, then he does not say that At the time; Because it is a seduction of it.
