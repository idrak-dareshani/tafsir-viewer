The third Qur’anic researcher: from the separation of the wise question, the Almighty said: The righteous is in a nickname, and the jaws are in the hell of their prayers on the day of the day.Know that God is exalted when he described the crime of the writers of the tones of worshipers.Two issues: The first question: that the sectors, with the people of the people of the cabinet, are holding this verse, so they said: Hell, if the thousand and the blame entered it, and it is used for the exposure, and the words are in this question, we have been excluded in the cow surah, and here is the abundance of it.Al -Waddiya was obtained in this verse, and it is indicative of the time of the promise.One of her: His Exalted: The day of the Day of Religion and the Day of Religion on the Day of Peninsula, and no time except and enter into it, as you say the day of the world and the day of the world.Al -Thani: Al -Jubayi said: If he had given us his saying: The jaws are in hell, some of the jaws would be to paradise, and if they had come to them, they would not be from the father The lavis is distinguished from the righteous, and that is false, because God is the exalted between the two things, then it is obligatory that the jewel will enter Paradise as the righteous does not enter.And the third: that he said: What they are about two of them, and he is like it: and what they are out of it [Al -Ma’idah: 37] and if there is no death and no absence, then there is no absence in the mind The two eternities, and when the name of the fabrication was the infidel and the Muslim who has the great owner of the people of the people of the captains ever in the fire, and it has proven that the rivalry of the people of the people, not the people of the people.The answer to it is that we have indicated that the connotation of the generalization of the generalization on the exodus is a weak and weak connotation.And holding the apparent, disturbing in the categorical, unable, but here is what indicates our saying: because the endeavor of the universal collection in the world and the one who is known to be in the definition and the one who is known The predecessor is great in the language, so it is necessary for the sake of the memorial to be a domesticity to the infidels who are offered by the lies of the lies in the day of the religion On the way of the exclusion, we greeted us that the general benefit the piece, but we do not surrender that the great owner of the old man is a jogging, and the evidence is upon him the saying They are the disbelief of the immorality [Abs: 42], so they do not either be either that the one who is the first is the disbelief that is from the hatred Fajr.The first: false; Because every disbeliever is, it is a mutilation, so the infidel of the infidel who is the one who is from the sweetener (P-78) is a mess, and if this is the chain of the division, and the second is the division of the division, The confusion, And if this verse indicates that the disbelievers are the immorality, not others, it is proven that the owner of the largest is not with a shine on the launch, we greeted us that the lava entered it And the Muslim, but his saying: What they are about with two absences is that it is the group of immorality, it is not cloudy, and we say that it is a matter The disbelievers are not absent, and if it is, it is proven that the truth of our saying is that the fleeing with their families is not absent, it is enough for it to be absent from the disbelievers, so there is no need for it.The Muslims, peace be upon you, but his saying: What they are from their absences requires their being in the offensive in hell and that is a lie.So it is imperative that it is from the back, so they carry it on the authority that they are after entering into hell, and he said that he said: What they are in the absence Immediately, they are not absent from the investigation of the universe in the hell, except that the evidence of the investigator does not contradict the pardon, we greeted us, but it is a opponent of the meaning And on the confirmation of the intercession of the people of the cabinet, and the survival of this side, because their evidence is inevitable and that all of the jewels will be in charge of all the abusers, otherwise they did not come to them, otherwise they did not.And our evidence is sufficient in his health, his entry into some of the jaws in some of the facts, so their evidence must be in general, and our indication must be, and it is for the public, and it is for the year Know.The second question: in which there is a great threat to the disobedience, it was narrated that Solomon ibn Abd al -Malik passed through the city while he wants Mecca, so he said to the father tomorrow?He said: As for the improvement, the absences are presented from his travel to his family, and the captive is the kernels of his followers, he said: He cried, then he said: “If only for me!” Abu Hazim said: Express your work on the book of God, he said: In what place in the book of God?He said: The righteous is in a nickname, and the jaws are in hell, and Jaafar Al -Sadiq, peace be upon him, said: And the hell is the amusement, and it was said: the righteous, the ritual, the pulling, the ritual, and it was said: the grace is the preoccupation with God, and the hell is to be the best of God.
