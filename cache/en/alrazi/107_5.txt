The Quranic researcher said: The Almighty said: That is the one who calls the orphan and does not urge the food of the poor.He knew that he was the highest mentioned in the definition of those who lie to the religion and two descriptions: one of them: from the door of verbs, and he said it: that is the one who calls the orphan.And the second: from the door of the rituals, and it is his saying: He does not urge the food of the poor and the fulfillment in its saying, “So this” is for the captivity, that is, when it was a disbeliever, the disbeliever was disbelieving.Rather, he was confined to them in the sense that the one who is a slave is lying in the debt is not only that, because we know that the deny of the debt is not the authority of the one who does not.The representation, as if it is a male in every one of the two divisions, is one example, which you alert him to his remembrance of the drivers of the doves, or for the sake of the two, for the sake of the two, as well Disturbing according to the legs, they are also denounced by the reckoning of the time and the humanity, but its saying: it is called the yatim, so the meaning is that it is paid by the one who pays it.Like his saying: A day they call for the fire of hell with a call [Al -Tor: 13] and he has the matter in the bid of the yatim things: The second: the condolences (P-106) is left with it, and if the sympathy is not obligatory.The woman may be vilified by killing the nawfil, especially if it is assigned to hypocrisy and the bloodshed.And the third: he enlightens it, strikes it, and becomes afraid of it, and reads “he calls” that is, he leaves it, and does not invite him with a supplication, that is, they call all of the people who are the people.The prayers and peace be upon him - he said: “There is no greatest extended from a long -term Or as a result.And he knows that in his saying: (He is called) with strict strain, which is that “he is called” by tightening, meaning that he is accustomed to that, so he does not have the good of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good And the same is the saying of the Almighty: Those who are avoided, like the sins of the ingredient and the concerns, except the pain [Al -Najm: 32] The sin of the believer was called for what is like it is like the one who is the same The believer, as he empties from the sin, is regretted, but the liar is the one who insists on sins.As for his saying: It is not urged on the food of the poor, in his face and heops: one of them: that it does not restrict himself to the food The poor, as if it prevented the poor from what is its right, and that indicates the end of his abundance and the harshness of his heart and the smoothness of his bowl.And the second: It is not incite to feed that of those who are poor because he does not imitate in that act reward, and the one who has the highest is the knowledge of the knowledge The weak and the prevention of the known, means that if he believed in the penalty and he was fed up with the feet of what he issued from that, then the place of sins is the denying With resurrection, and we are two questions: The first question: Is it not that the woman does not urge a lot of conditions and is not a sin?Answer: Because others are the same as his pulpits or because he does not accept his saying or for another sponge that he sits, but he is not so that he does not do so) With religion.The second question: Why did he not say: The poor do not feed?And the answer: If the yatim is prohibited from its right, how is it feed the poor of the money of itself, but it is a horse from the money other than it, and this is the end in the lies, for the sake First, and against it in the praise of the believers: and they are converging with the mercy] The country: 17], and they are firmly fulfilled [Al -Asr: 3], and they are persistent with patience.[Al -Asr: 3] Fawal for the prayers who are from their prayers, Sahoun * * * Then he said: Fawal is for those who are the ones who are from their prayers: How to connect this verse with what is before it is a face: one of them: that it does not do the harm to the orphan and the prohibition from food is evidence of hypocrisy, for the prayer is not with the absence, On hypocrisy; Because the harm and prevention from the benefit is a treatment with the creature, but the prayer is a servant of the creator.And the second: as if he mentioned the harm to the Yatim and left it to the urbanization, as if a questioner said: Isn't the prayer forbidding the perpetuation and denial?He said to him: Prayer is how to forbid it from this denying act, which is a variety of the eyes of lime and the cheerful.And the third of it: as if he says: His feet on harming the yatim and left it to the ground, shortening while he returns to the companionship of the creation of God, and the sacrifice of the prayer He returns to the greater of the command of God, so when the shortening in the two commands was fell in the two things, then his inclination has been filled with: for this, he said: (Fawal) and he knows that this is the one who is.When the strawberry is like his saying: Wahl for the two sides [Al -Muthanafin: 1] Fawal to them from what was written by their hands [Al -Baqarah: 79], It is narrated that every one is in the fire on the basis of its generosity, a saying that says: It is followed by the love of the honor, and another says: And it is from the ignorance of the ignorant, and the one who says: For this, this is the same as the hearing of this verse, that the woman says and follows if he did not forgive me.The second question: the verse is indicative of the Great Determination by the verbs of three things: one of them: the authority of the prayer.And the second: the verb.And the third of it: preventing those who are obligated, and all of that is a matter of sins, and the woman does not become a hypocrisy, so God has ruling like this, this is the same as the act of this?For the sake of this forms, the interpreters are mentioned in it.Acts, and on this estimation indicates The verse is that the infidel has a more timelessness because of its feet on the prohibitions of the law and its blessings of the obligatory databases, and it is indicative of the validity of the saying: They address the bouquets, and this answer is the one.And the second: What a giving narrated from Ibn Abbas was that if God said: In their prayers, Sahoun, if this is the return in the believers, but he said: He said: On the authority of the prayers of the one who is the one who is the one who is the prayer He remembers her and is empty of her, and this saying is weak because the pleasure of prayer is not permissible to be an innocent by the blessing of the prayer, because it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the prayer of the prayer.A loyalty to the prayers and also, so the misery is from prayer in the sense of the blessing, it is not a hypocris They are two prayers in view of the image and that they forgot the prayer in the kidney, in view of the meaning as he said: And if they rose to the prayer, they rose up, the people of the people, and they do not remember.It is obligatory for the second synthesis that the forgetting of the prayer is that he remains a people for the remembrance of God in all the parts of the prayer, and this is not released except from the hypocrisy of the one who does not Prayer, as for the Muslim who believes in a single eyes, it is forbidden to remember the matter of religion, reward, and punishment in something of the parts of the prayer, but the prayer of the prayer.Prayer in the sense that it becomes easy in some of the parts of the prayer, so it has proven that the pleasure in prayer is one of the actions of the believer, and the flame of the prayer is from the actions of the infidel.Third: To be a meaning: (Sahoun), meaning that they do not pledge their prayers and their rituals, and it is meaning that it does not come to me, whether he prayed, or he did not pray, and he is the saying Good and fighting.The third question: they disagreed with the sacrifice of the Messenger - peace and blessings be upon him - in his prayers, so he said many of the scholars: He - peace and blessings be upon him That action until what is done by Al -Sahei, and that becomes a bayna for that legitimacy with the verb, and the Bayan with action is stronger, then the sake of it, On the partitions: one of them: the sacrifice of the Messenger and the companions, and that is forced by the prostration of the sacrifice, and it is shed by the Sunnah and the Nawafel.The second: What is in the prayer is from forgiveness, and the abundance of knowledge and the intentions.And the third: the leaving is not to the elimination of the time, and from the time of the hypocrisy, it is an evil of the blessings of the prayer, because it is mocking the debt with that prayer.As for the saying of the Exalted: Those who are brighters, know that the difference is between the hypocrisy and the mirror: that the hypocrisy is the appearance of the faithful faith of the disbelief, and the one who is the one who is the one His heart is from the increase of fear Let those who see that he sees that he is a bid, or says: The hypocrisy does not pray a secret, and the traitors will be his prayers at the most good.(P-108) Know that it is obligatory to show the exhibits of prayer and zakat because it is the rituals of Islam, and its blessing is fulfilled by the curse, so it is necessary to deny the deer.Rather, the hidden in the nawfle is unless the nawfle appears to be imitated, and for each other that he saw in the mosque a man who glorifies the thanks and prolonged it, so he said: But with this, they said: Nawafi does not leave life and does not come to him with an affliction, and the genius of the genius is easy, and this is why he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: The night of injustice is on the wiping of the supplier.We said: It is a reactor of arrests, because the mirror sees people his work, and they see him praise and admiration for him.
