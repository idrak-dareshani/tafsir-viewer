The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, is the same: a day that is a bad day for the infidels, and it does not happen in it.In it in the Naqur, and the estimation: this day is a bad day.Because his saying is that it is enticed to be a reference to the click, and that it will be a sign to the added day to the click, as if he said: So that is the meaning of the day to the day It will be the day in the place of the fix.The second: to be a day, the place of the place is instead of that, and the day is a difficult day.As if it was said: The day of the click is a difficult day, so this is a “day” in the place of raising; To make him an instead of “that”, except that the day was added to “as“ and it is not possible - built on the conquest.The third: that the estimation of the verse: that click is a day of a day.The worker will be on the day is the click.The second question: The day of that day is on the infidels because they are discussed in the account and give their books to their domesticity, and they will be bound, and they will be bound, And their wounds are spoken, and they make it clear to the heads of martyrs, and the believers are that they are walking because they are not discussed in the account, and they will be broken.And it is necessary to be, but God Almighty described him with the hardship, because he is in itself as well as for all of the believers and the infidels on what is narrated that the one who narrated is that The newborn, they are only, but the infidels are more severe.Asir, and otherwise, and on the second saying, the stand is good; Because the meaning is that in itself is difficult for all, then the infidel is special in it with a special increase, which is that it is not easy for him, so if he said: So what is said: Facilitating and disobedient to him?Answer: As for the first saying: the freshness is to confirm as you say: I have a lover who is not hateful, and it is not an enemy.As for the second saying: His saying: Asir benefits the origin of the hardship of the believers and the disbelievers, and his saying: It is not easy that will benefit the Zaydah.Because the hardship may be a little difficult, and it may be a lot of hardship, so the origin of the hardship was proven to all, and the hardship was proven with the righteousness For disbelievers.The third question: Ibn Abbas said: When he said that it is not easy for the disbelievers, he was walking on the believers, so some of the one said to be the same.A pilgrimage, except when Ibn Abbas understood from his being, it is not easy on the infidel, as it is easy for the believer.(P-175)
