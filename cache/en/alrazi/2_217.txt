The researcher is the Almighty: They ask you about the month of the forbidden, in which there is a fight in which there is great and a reply from the path of God and disbelieved in it and the mosque of the forbidden and the one who is forbidden And the temptation is greater than killing, and they are still fighting you until they want you to return And the hereafter and those who are the people of the fire are in which they are immortalized in the verse: And those who say that he is one of the Muslims who are the first: the first partner: those who said: It is up to them when he wrote to them the fighting and it was for the people of the people of the people The prohibition in preventing the fighting is not far from them that the matter is to fight, restricting that it will be in this time, and in this place, then they called them, so that they called them, so that they called them, so that they called them, so that they called them, so they called them.Is our fighting for us in this month and in this position?The verse was revealed, so this phenomenon is that this question was among the Muslims.The second partner: They are the most interpreter: they narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ sent the servant of God ibn Jahsh al -Assad, and he is the son In two months, and after seven ten months of the city of the city in the eighteenth of Rahit, and wrote to him a book and a covenant and paid it to him, and he did not, He reads it to his companions, and does what is in it, so if it is in it: As for after, then go on the blessing of God, the Almighty, who follows you until you go down, then it is a good.Quraysh, perhaps you will come from him well, so Abdullah said: Heard and obedience to his command, so he said to his companions: Whoever loves you, the testimony, so let him be the same And whoever loves the backwardness, let him be backward, then he went until he reached a stomach between Mecca and the sects, so he passed upon them Amr ibn Al -Hadr The companions of the Messenger of God ﷺ threw one head of them and deluded with that that they are the people of Ammar, and then he came to the son of Abdullah al -Hanzhal Amr ibn al -Hadrami, killing him, and captivating two and the legs of the elderly in it until they came to the Messenger of God ﷺ, so the Quraysh was done, and they said: A month in which the fear is safe, and the blood will be sorry, and the Muslims have also followed that, so he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him, and peace be upon you, and he said: I have not commanded you.God ibn Jahsh: O Messenger of God, we killed the son of Al -Hadram The elderly and the captives, so this The verse, so the Messenger of God took the prayer and peace be upon him.The present at the Messenger of God ﷺ were Muslims.And his saying: Or did you think that they would enter the paradise [the cow: 214] and it is a speech with the Muslims, and his saying: They ask you about the wine and the water [219] On the authority of Al -Yamami [Al -Baqara: 220].A question until he is arrested, all of them in the Qur’an, from which they ask you about the month of the forbidden.The fighting in the month of the forbidden even if he told them that it is permissible, then they would have been destroyed by it, and they were broken by his fighting in it, so God Almighty has revealed this verse: They ask you about a fight in the month of the forbidden.They respond to you from your religion, and he showed that the exaggeration of this question is to fight the Muslims, then God Almighty, then he said: He took advantage of you, and they are used to him with the same way as the cow: 194] So he said in this verse that the fighting is on the way of the payment.Fighting in it is a separation from the exile from the month of the forbidden, and this is called the insults of the insults, as you say: I liked me the increase of his knowledge, and we will see it as a lot of people, and it is more like a lot of people.His rewards, the Almighty said: The people of the fierce are killed with a fuel [Al -Baraouj: 4, 5] and he said: The light in a fight against the work of the worker, and the estimation: In it, and so is it in the readers of Ibn Masoud and the Lord, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: for those who are weakened by those who believe in them [Al -Araf: 75] In it).* * He specializes in his saying: in it, so it is good to make it begin, and what is meant by his saying: is great, that is, the great, disbelieving, as it is called the ritual, the name is called, the greatest is the name of the one who is called.A word that comes out of their mouths was enlarged [Al -Kahf: 5].In the end of the masculine The second is the first; Because if he was not the same as the second, the first was the first, as in the words of the Almighty: that with the hardship is easy [the explanation: 6].We said: Yes, what you mentioned is that the memorization if it was repeated and they were denied, and the one who is intended for the second was the first of the first, and the people wanted to say: That is the appointed fighting, which is presented to him, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, so he said: Say: A fight in it is great and in which he alerts it that the fighting is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Which you asked about, but it is another fighting; Because this fighting was the supply of the victory of Islam and the humiliation of the infidels, so how is this from the cabinets, but the great fighting is the one who is the abuse in it, and the abuse is in it.It was the choice of denial in the memorials for the sake of this accuracy, except that it is the highest of what was stated in this words; Like their hearts are narrowed, but the words of the words are where it is his appearance as they are their understanding of what they wanted, and its innerness is a agreement to the truth, and this is that it is not.The two people are on the way of denial, even if the expression was made about them or from one of them with the memorial of the cessation of the hero of this, the good, the good, the goodness, Every word (P-28).* * * Ibn Jarraj, that he said: I have a giving to God that it is not permissible for people to invade in the sanctuary, nor in the most deprived of the most deprived, except on the path of the payment, he said: God ﷺ invades in the month of the forbidden, except to be invaded.” Said bin Al -Masib was asked: Is it possible for Muslims to fight the infidels in the month of the forbidden?He said: Yes, Abu Ubaid said: People with gaps all over all of this saying, they see the conquest, permitted in all the months, and I did not see anyone of the people They have also been according to the saying of the people of Hijaz.And the argument in its permitted is the saying of the Almighty: So kill the entrepreneurs where you found them [the repentance: 5] and this verse is a dirt to prohibit the fighting in the month of the month, and the one who says: Hope: Say a fight in which there is a greatness, this is a denial in the context of the evidence, so there is a single individual, and all the individuals do not take over, so this verse is not indicative in it, in which there is no significance in it.The month of the forbidden, so there is no need to estimate the copy in it.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: It is an eternity of the path of God, and it is disbelieved in it, and the mosque is the forbidden, and the dearest of his family is greater from God for God, in his two questions: This verse is a face: the first: the saying of the Basrin, It is the one who was chosen by Al -Zajaj that his saying: He is a reply from the path of God and his disbelief in him and the mosque is the forbidden and the exit of his family from all of them is a mourning of the word By God, and the meaning: that the fighting that you asked about, and if it is great, this is more than that of these things, then if you do not refrain from it in the month of the month, then the one Bin Jahsh on that fighting, with him that he has an exclusive excuse, for it was permissible for that killing to be a darkness in the last of the hereafter, and the opposite of his saying Israel: Do you command people with righteousness and forget yourself [the cow: 44], why do you say what you do not do [the class: 2] and this is a face that is in the face of the His saying: And the mosque is the forbidden, and they mentioned in it and its faces: one of them: that it is a compassion for the distraction in it.The second: It is the saying of the most, that it is a kindness on the path of God, they said: He is sure that he said: “Those who disbelieve and repel from the authority of God.” And assume on the first direction that it is not permissible to comply with the guerrilla, because it is not said: I passed it with it and Omar, and on the second that the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The path of God and the mosque of the forbidden, so he said: On the authority of the mosque, a prayer is a link to the oppression, and the prayer and the connection in the ruling of the one thing, so the rhythm of the fans is not between them Equipped.I answer from the first: Why is it not permissible to add the rudder of the run in it until the estimation is: and it is disbelieved in it and the mosque is the forbidden, and the guarantee is in the words of God.This is the rule of Hamza (you ask about it and the mercy) on the way of the reduced, even if the Hamza narrated this language, it was an acceptance of the horizons, so if it was in the agreement, then it was in the agreement, so if it was in.Or is it possible to be an acceptance, and the most of those who have chosen the second saying said: There is no doubt that it requires the fall of the foreigners between the prayer and the ritual, and it is not that it is not.We are borne for us to Jahin: The first: that the replacement of the path of God and the disbelief in Him is like the one one in the meaning, as if there is no chapter.The second: that the position of its saying: and the disbelief in it is the one who said it: and the mosque is the forbidden, except that it was presented (P-29) on it for the excess of the curse, and it is not.He has a sufficient one that was the right of speech to be said: He did not have one sufficiency, except that the excess of care was required to be able to present it, so it is so.The second face in this verse, and it is the choice of the freedom and the father of Muslim Al -Asfani: that his saying is up to the Almighty: and the mosque is the righteousness A fight in the month of the forbidden and the mosque, then after this one: one of them: that his saying: a fight in it is a beginner, and his saying: great and repent A news after a news, and the estimation: the fighting in it is a rule over it that it is great and that it is a reply from the path of God, and that it is disbelieving.And the second way: that it is his saying: a fight in which there is a great sentence and a news, and his saying: and a replacement of the path of God, so it is a man who is a good man, and it is a good man, and it is a good man, and it is a good man.And disbelieve in it and the news is deleted to the way of what it is presented to it, and the estimation: Say there is a largest in which there is great and repulsion from the path of God is great and disbelieving, and the disbelief of it, Increased increase and age, its estimation: and Omar is divorced, the Basris stabbed this answer, and they said: As for your saying: the estimation of the verse: they ask about the one who asks you: The forbidden is weak; Because the question was about to fight in the forbidden month, it is not about fighting in the forbidden mosque, and they were stabbed in the first face that it is necessary that the fighting is in the month of the month, and it is the one who is in the month of the month, and it is the one who is in the month of the month.With consensus, and stabbed in the second direction that he said after that: and his family is broken from him, the greatest of any greater than all that is presented, so it is necessary to be the one The mosque is greater with God than disbelief, and it is a mistake in consensus.And I say: The individual should answer the first that he is the one who told you that the question was not about the fighting in the mosque in the forbidden?Rather, it appears that it was located; Because the people were glorified by the fighting in the month of the forbidden and in the country of the forbidden, and one of them was like the other in the ugliness at the people, so the prestige is that they gathered them in the question The first face is necessary for the fighting in the month of the forbidden.We said: It is necessary for a fight in the month of the forbidden, and we say it; Because the denial in the evidence does not benefit the general, and when one of the fighting is in the mosque, it is not unbelievers, and it is not obligatory that every fight is like that, and they say to them on the one It will be the exit of the people of the mosque from it greater than the infidels, our saying: What is meant by the people of the mosque are the Messenger, peace and companions, and the delay of the Messenger of the Majestic There is no doubt that it is disbelief, and it is with his unbelief, so it is injustice; Because it is harmful to a human being from a precedent and later offering, and there is no doubt that the thing that is injustice and disbelief, the greatest and the ugliness of God, is what God has The sentence of saying in the report of the saying of the Farah.The third saying: In the verse, it is said: Say there is a largest and an eternity of the path of God and its disbelief in it is an apparent face, which is that it is in which there is a ritual in which it is the same.In his saying: The mosque is the forbidden, so it is the oath, except that the gathering did not establish for this saying and adultery.* * * And the second: a replacement For Muslims, who are immigrant to the Messenger, peace be upon him.And the third of it: the condemnation of the Muslims in the year of the Hadaybiyah on the authority of the house.And it is a saying to say: The narration indicated that this verse was descended before the invasion of Badr in the story of Abdullah ibn Jahsh, and the story The invasion of a period of time in a long period, and it can be answered by it that what was in (P-30) is the knowledge of God Almighty was like the occurrence, and as for the disbelief in God, the unbeliever is the same He is due to worship, and he is able to resurrect, and his saying: And the mosque is the forbidden, so if we are sympathetic to the guerrilla in it, the meaning was: With the mosque, it is the prevention of the people from praying in it and the circumambulation of it, so they disbelieved what is the reason in its virtue that it is distinguished from the one who said: The way of God was the meaning: and he replied from the mosque.That is because they resonated from the mosque, the wandering, the workers, and the kneeling.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: and the exalted of his family from him, so what is meant is that they have brought out the Muslims from the mosque, but rather from the Mecca, but rather made them a family; As they were the two who are the right to the facts of the house, as he said: And they were obligated to the word of piety, and they were entitled to it and its people [Al -Fateh: 26] and he said: He does not have to be tortured by God The mosque is the forbidden, and they were not the guardians of the first people [Al -Anfal: 34], so he told the Almighty that the two polytheists came out of their evil from the one who was the one.Then it is up after that these things mentioned that they were more than greater, that is, each one of them is greater than a fight in the month of the forbidden, and this is a separation.Rather, we said: Each one of these things is greater than a fight in the month of the forbidden to Jajah: one of them: that every one of these things is disbelieving, and the disbelief is more than one.The second: We claim that every one of these things is greater than the fighting in the month of the forbidden, and it is the fighting that was issued by the worshiper of God ibn Jahsh, which was what was a veil in the authority The forbidden, and these infidels are the ones who are in the fall of these things from them in the month of the forbidden, so it is necessary that the fall of these things is greater.As for the saying of the Almighty: The girl is greater than the killing, so they mentioned in the temptation two sayings: one of them: it is the infidelity, and this is the saying of it.Because on the saying of the gospel, it has been presented, so it is upset, he said: and the disbelief in it is greater, so the temptation is carried on the infidelity, and this is a good.Right on the saying of the freedom.And the second saying: that the temptation was what they were grateful to the Muslims from their religion, touched by the meeting of the youth in their hearts, and the anxiety, as well Balal, Shayb and Ammar Bin Yasser, and this is the saying of Muhammad ibn Ishaq, and we have mentioned that the temptation is a phrase of the two of the two, it is said: then it is said: then it is the same To remove fraud from him, and from him the Almighty saying: Rather, your money and your children are a temptation [Al -Tagbin: 15] that is, a granted to you; Because if the spending of money is required in the path of God, he thinks about his son, then he became forbidden to spend, and he said: “Did you not think about the people who left, and they would not be left.[Al -Anakbout: 1, 2] That is: they are not embraced in their religion with the types of calamities, and he said: And we miss you.I am in God, he made the temptation of people like the torment of God [Al -Anakkab: 10] and what is meant by the one who is afflicted by the debt from the infidels and said: And the believers, then they did not repent [Al -Baraj: 10], and it is intended that they laid down them and presented them with the torment, so that they can be steadfast on their religion You have been afraid that those who disbelieved you [the women: 101] and said: What you have to do with those who are not those who are the righteous of Al -Jahim [Al -Saffat: 162] and he said: So he will follow him Amr: 7] That is, the insult in religion, and he said: Beware of them to fascinate you about some of what God has revealed to you [Al -Maaidah: 49] and he said: Our Lord does not make us, and you will make us.7] And he said: Our Lord does not make us a temptation for the people who are unjustly And the shadow said: So they see and see you with the deadly [Pen: 65].As it is a cultivation and an essence of the path of the people of peace in the minds.So these verses have proven that the temptation is the two of the two, but we said: The temptation is greater than the killing; Because the temptation of religion leads to the many killing in the world, and to the right to suffer a permanent torment in the hereafter, it is correct that the temptation is greater than the one who killed the death The question was about him while he was killed by Ibn Al -Hadrami.It was narrated that when this verse was revealed, the book of Abdullah bin Jahsh, the owner of this secret, wrote to the believer, Mecca: If the evil will be given to you So, give them the disbelief and the sacrifice of the Messenger of God ﷺ from the Mecca, and the believer is forbidden from the forbidden house, he said: They are not fighting you until you want you to want you And his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: and you will not be satisfied with you, or the Christians until you follow their mill [Al -Qarra: 120].* * * And there are issues: the first question: He still does so, and he is still doing like this, the one said: This is a verb, not a source He has, and it is not said from him: a subject or a verb, and his example in the actions is many, like (maybe) has no source or harmony, and so, and what is, They do not sleep on that action; Because the disappearance is beneficial to the negation, if you enter it: What was that of the exile for the negation, then it will be an indication of the permanent confidence.The second question: His saying: until they want you from your religion, that is, until they want you, and it was said: the meaning: to return you.The third question: His saying: If you are able to redeem them for their obedience, as the man said to his enemy: If you are bound by me, do not stay with me, and he will not stay with me, and he will not stay With it.* * * Then he said: And whoever hesitates from you from his religion, then he is dead while he is a disbeliever and has questions: the first question: The one said: His saying: And whoever does not appear For the second letters, and it is more in the language of slurring, and his saying: It is a reward for the conversion to the hesitation and his answer, so the first of you.The second question: When the Almighty indicated that their abuse from that fighting is that Muslims will be resulted From you from his religion, then he is dead, and it is a disbeliever, so those whose work was seen in the world and the hereafter, and the lasting torment is required in the fire.* * * The third question: the appearance of the verse requires that the increase is the rulings on which the reminiscent rulings are separated if the one dies on the infidels, but if it is the same Something of these rulings, and it may be separated from this joke with the research of the fundamentalism and the search of vouge, but the arriving search is that it is a group of those who are the one The condition of the validity of faith and infidels is the arrival of muddam, for faith is not faith unless the believer dies upon him and the disbelief is not unbelievers unless the disbeliever dies on him, he said: And God, with God, if that of that phenomenon was a faith in the truth, he would have deserved the eternal reward for him, then after his disbelief, then he deserves the punishment.الِاسْتِحْقاقانِ وهو مُحالٌ, وإمّا (p-32)أنْ يُقالَ: إنَّ الطّارِئَ يُزِيلُ السّابِقَ, وهَذا مُحالٌ لِوُجُوهٍ: أحَدُها: أنَّ المُنافاةَ حاصِلَةٌ بَيْنَ السّابِقِ والطّارِئِ, فَلَيْسَ كَوْنُ The emergency is a removal for the first of the first of the precedent, a bush for the emergency, but the second is the first; Because the payment is easier than raising.And the second: that the contradiction, if it is from the two sides, was the condition of the emergence of the emergence of the past, and if we had the disappearance of the precedent, the ritual of the ritual of the ritual is obligatory.And the third of it: that the reward for the precedent faith and the punishment of the disbelieving disbelief, either that we are equal, or be one of them more than the other, for if it is equal, it is necessary for it to be equal to each other Another, So, the cost remains, neither from the people of the reward, nor from the people of punishment and it is invalid in consensus, and if one of them increases, let us be satisfied that the precedent is the most prominent It disappears only what is equal to it, so it goes away from some of the investigations without some with its being equal in the essence, so that it will be like that, and it is a successful one, and it is a way that is a success.Let us expose that the previous one is the least, either, either the excessive emergency, the sentence of its parts is influenced by the prime of the predecessor, so the one who is the one The effects are independent and it is referred, or the influencer is to remove the previous one, some of the parts of the emergency without some, and then the one will be the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is chosen by that.Singing to the example of others is likely to be referred, and you have proven what we mentioned that if he was a believer and then disbelieved, then the precedent faith, and if we had no faith, then he was not.Faith, it appeared that the condition is a condition for the formation of faith in faith, and the disbelief is a disbelief, and this is the one who indicated the verse on it, so it indicated that the condition of the custodian is the case The rulings are that the stretch dies on that apostasy.* * * As for the pious research: it is that the Muslim is if he prayed, then he wores, then he became Muslim at the time.Al -Shafi’i said, may God have mercy The elimination of what performed the pilgrimage, the Hajj of the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him The deeds of the work to die while he is a disbeliever, and this person is not found in his right this condition, so it is obligatory not to make his work a lump, for if it is said: this is: this is: They shared to be overwhelmed by what they were doing [Al -Anam: 88] and his saying: And whoever disbelieves in faith has lost his work [Al -Maaidah: 5] It is not said: “ Because we say: This is not from the chapter on the divorced and the restriction, for they have gathered on the fact that those who commented a ruling on two conditions, and commented it with the condition that the ruling is that the rule of the rule is that the rule He said to his servant: You are free if the day comes to the day, you are free if the day of the five and the collection comes: no one of them is invalidated, but if the day of the five came, then it is the day The fifth was not in his king, then he was bought and then came on the day of the Friday while he was in his king, he was ahead of the first learning.And the second question about contacting this verse: that this verse indicated that death is a condition for the group of the rulings that are mentioned in this verse, and this is the one who is mentioned in this.With it, then from the sentence of these rulings: the immortality in the fire and that is only proven with this condition, but the dispute in the lumping of the work, and it is not in the verse that is the same شَرْطٌ فِيهِ.The answer is that this is a matter of divorced and restricted, not from the matter of attachment to one condition and two conditions; Because the relationship is a condition and two conditions, but it is not true, if it was not attached to each of them, one of them is forbidden from his relationship with the last, and in the other The response is influenced in the tries, and the death remains for the response, and it has been in the origin of the origins in the first place in any of the facts.بَلْ مِن بابِ المُطْلَقِ والمُقَيَّدِ.As for the second question: its answer is that the verse indicated that the narration is required by the condition of the condition of death on the response, but it requires the immortality in the fire, on the condition of the fire, on the condition of the condition, And on this estimation, that question is dropped.* * * As for his saying, the highest: Those are the severity of their business in the world and the hereafter, so it has books: the first question: the people of the language said: the origin of the darkening is that It is harmful, so it is glorified by its stomachs, and it will be exhausted, and in the hadith: “And what the rabbi prophesies what is killed or died.Because it is the corruption of the thing with the arrogance of the spoil on it.* * * The second question: What is meant by the frustration of the work is not the hero of the same work; Because the work is something that was found, and it is impressive, and the execution of the enemies is referred, then the speakers differed in it.عِقابَ الرِّدَّةِ الحادِثَةِ يُزِيلُ ثَوابَ الإيمانِ السّابِقِ, إمّا بِشَرْطِ المُوازَنَةِ عَلى ما هو مَذْهَبُ أبِي هاشِمٍ وجُمْهُورِ المُتَأخِّرِينَ مِنَ المُعْتَزِلَةِ أوْ لا بِشَرْطِ المُوازَنَةِ عَلى ما هو Abi Ali went, and those who denounced the frustration of this meaning: What is meant from the incoming frustration in the book of God is that the one who comes with the plot, then the ritual is the same.Because the one who comes in the narration could have come with a work that he deserves to be rewarded, then if he does not come with that good deed and he will come to him, he will not be done with the goodness From it, it is a benefit, but it is beneficial from it the greatest of the harms.This is what we mentioned in the interpretation of frustration, either to be a truth in the memorization of frustration, or that it is not, if it is a truth in it, it is obligatory for the destiny to it To me; Because we mentioned the signs of the seized in the question that the stipulation is a condition in the validity of faith, that the saying that the impact of the juvenile action removes the effect of the action.The third question: As for the love of the work in the world, it is that he is killed by the nail of it and fights until it is bound by it, and it is not worthy of the believer, nor the believer, nor the believer, nor the believer, nor the believer, nor the believer, nor the faithful, no.His husband shows from him and does not deserve the inheritance from The Muslims, and it is permissible for the meaning to be in his saying: their businesses in the world were seen that what they want after the response is to harm the Muslims and the Muslims from the two of the Muslims Their religion is all of it, so they do not get anything from it to the sake of God, Islam, with his supporters, so the works will be on this interpretation of what they do.The values ​​of their business in the last, as those who say that there is a frustration that is that this response is invalidated Those who deny this with it: that they do not benefit from that response, reward and benefit in the hereafter, but they will benefit from it the greatness The Almighty said: And those who are the people of the fire are in it.
