The Quranic researcher, as he said, is the Almighty: Then he does not die in it and does not live in his two issues: the first question: for those who are interpreters in it and Jahan: one of them: he does not die, and he does not die.It is beneficial, as he said: He does not judge them, so they will die, and they are not relieved of their torment [Fatir: 36], and this is on the view of the Arabs, you say to the one who is not the same.And secondly: it is that it is the same as one of them in the fire.The second question: it was said: (then), because this situation is more and greater than the prayer, so it is cruel from it in the paths of intensity.As for his words, the Almighty: I have succeeded whoever zakat in his face and Jahan: one of them: that he is up to the one who mentioned and the feast of those who exposed the look and reflection in the words of God.For those who are zakat and purifying from theasis of evil.And secondly: It is the saying of the gospel: it is more than piety because the meaning of the many developing is the most, and this face is opposed to the words of the Almighty: they have come in Their prayers are humbled [the believers: 1] As for the first face, it is an administering with two John: the first: that it is up to what he did not remember in the verse that is required to be zakat on it, that we know that the intention is the one who is the one who is the one who is the good Before the verse, and that is the infidelity, so we knew that what is meant is: He has succeeded whoever zakat on the disbelief whose remembrance passed before this verse.The second: The divorced name is spent to the full name, and the fullness of the types of zakat is the zakat of the heart of the injustice of the infidelity, so it is necessary for the sake of this.This is the interpretation of what was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said meaning: He said: There is no god but God.
