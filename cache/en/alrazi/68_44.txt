The Quranic researcher said, "Um to you, I want us to do the language to the Day of Resurrection, if you do not judge and have two questions: And you have gone to him on the authority of him, meaning a mother of you, and we have divided you with a thicker, eager to confirm.If it was said: to say it: to the Day of Resurrection, what is it commented?Say: It is in it and Jahan: The first: It is attached to its saying: The language, that is, these days in its strength and its hope that it is attached to the day of the resurrection.The second: that the estimation is: a steady one to the Day of Resurrection.It will be the meaning of (the language) is confirmed as it says: good in the language, and everything is died in health and goodness, so it is a language, and as for his saying: for you, for you are: The division; Because it is a meaning: a mother of you is a hand over us or our division for you.The second question: Al -Hasan (language) is read by setting, and it is a stake in the case of the guarantor in the custody.Then he said to the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him: He asked them, which is a leader, and the meaning, which of them is that the judgment is a leader, that is, it is based on it and the one who does not do so With their affairs.* * * Then he said: The mother of them is a partner, so let them come to their parts, if they were honest and in his interpretation and Jahan: The first: the meaning, or they have things that they do not.They believe that these are the partners, they make them in the hereafter like those believers in reward and salvation from punishment, but rather added to them; Because they made it a partner to God, and this is as his saying: Is it one of your partners who do from this from something (Romans: 40).The second face: In the meaning, they have people who share them in this gold, which is the level between the Muslims and the criminals.It is that there is no mental indication in the proof of this gold, and there is no transmission evidence and it is a book that they study, so there is no one who agrees with them from the mind of this On the authority of all the faces.And know that he was upset when he said their saying, and spoiling their article, explaining after that the greatness of the Day of Resurrection.He said: A day will reveal a leg and in which there are questions: the first question: a day that is erected with what?There are three faces in it: one of them: that it is erected, with his saying: (Let them come) in his saying: Let them come with their parts, and that is the right of the day He said: If they were honest in that it is a partner, let them come to it on the day of resurrection, to benefit them and intercede for them.And the second: it is erected by the addition of a remembrance.And the third of it: that the estimation is: a day to reveal a leg, Kit and Katt were deleted for the vigil of the vicinity, and that then the ka’in is not described.The second question: this is the day in which it is revealed from a leg, uh on the day Summit or in the world?In it is the saying: The first is the one who has the gathering: that the day of resurrection, then in the interpretation of the leg and its face This verse, so he said: If something is hidden from you from the Qur’an, then seek it in the poetry, then it is the Diwan of the Arabs, but you have heard the saying of the poet: Warning is on the leg and then he said: It is a distress and a severity, and a Mujahid narrated from it, he said: It is the most severe hour in the resurrection, and the people of the language sought many verses (from it): His loudness is raised and not bored, and from it: I revealed to you about her leg ∗∗∗ and it seemed from the evil evil and Jarir said: ؎ except the Lord of Samar Al -Tarf from the family of Mazen ∗∗∗ if he said: Another: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Qatibah: The origin of this is that if a man falls on a great matter that needs grandfather in it, he is shed from his legs, so it is not said that it is said in the position of the severity: A confession from the people of the language by the fact that seeking the legs in the severity is a metaphor, and the scholars collect that it is not permissible to tell the words to the metaphor, except after the excuse of the sake The indicators are the highness that the exalted is that it is a body, so it is necessary for the sake of the memorial to the metaphor, and know that the owner of the “scout” is this Another, and he said: The revelation of the leg is like the severity For the cutting of the scarcity: his hand is a mullah, and there is no hand, then no, but it is an example in the miserliness, then he took the knowledge of the flag, and he says: “For him, for him, for him, and for him, and for him, for him.And I say: Either he claims that he has spent the memorization of his apparent, without an indication, or he says: It is not permissible for that only after the abuse of his pregnancy, and the sake of the sake of the right, The Muslims, and because if we are distinguished by that, the gates of the interpretations of the philosophy are opened in the matter of the re -of the matter, then they say in its saying: the gardens of the rituals of the rituals (11) There is no ritual or trees, but rather it is an example for pleasure and happiness, and they say in his saying: Rose and prostrate (Hajj: 77), there is no prostration.Rather, it is an example of the greater, and it is known that that leads to lifting the bodies and the corruption of religion, and if he said: that it is not possible to be interpreted, except that it is not after that He carried him on his backs, for this is the one who is still one of the speakers (except) he said with him and he was reluctant to him, so that this is the ritual With her knowledge and knowledge of her, by the point of the knowledge of the Bayan, God has mercy on him, knowing his destiny, and what is evaluated.The second saying: It is (P-84) the saying of Abu Saeed Al-Dair: A day will reveal a leg, that is, from the origin of the matter, and the leg of the thing is the origin of it, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the leg of it, The Day of Resurrection appears and its origins.The third saying: one day it will be revealed from the leg of hell, or from the leg of the throne, or from the leg of a great and vigil king He is not in the memorizer what indicates it.And the righteous saying: It is the choice of the likeness, that he is the leg of God, may God bless him, narrated from Ibn Masoud from him, peace and blessings be upon him: The resurrection when the Muslims pass, and he says: Who do you worship?They say: We worship God, and he will testify for two or three times, and then say: Do you know your Lord, and they say: Glory be to him if he knows us, then he will know him He reveals from a leg, so there is no believer except for a prostration, and the escorts remain as they appear as a single class, as if in the viciousness in it.He knew that this saying is false to its faces: one of them: that the evidence indicated that every body is modern; Because every body is dead, and every modern is updated; Because every body is that it does not break from the movement and the knife, and everything that was like that is an event; Because every body is possible, and every event is possible.And the second: that if it was intended for that, it would be the right of the leg to be known, because it is a special leg with a grave with it, and it is the leg of the mercy, but it is for the sake of it.The denunciation of the significance is extensive, as if it was said: a day reveals from a severity, and any intensity, that is, a severity that cannot be described.And the third of it: that the curiosity does not obtain the revelation from the leg, but rather it is made by revealing the face.The second saying: that his saying: a day reveals from a leg that is not intended from the Day of Resurrection, but he is in the world, and this is the saying of my father, a Muslim who said: He does not Resurrection; Because he said in the description of this day: and they call for prostration (Pen: 42) and the day of resurrection is in which there is no worship and no way, but what is meant is from the one who is intended from it Its world is like his saying: The day they see the angels, not a chair (the difference: 22), then he sees people who pray for the prayers if the rituals are attended, and it is not possible.Because it is the time that does not benefit the same faith, or the state of the pyramid, the sick and the reward, and they were before that day, they are called to the prostration, and they are the ones who are in the way, and they are the one who is safe from that of them.Blinding with them from what they were appointed to the death or from the miracle and the pyramid, and the counterpart of this verse is his saying: If not if you reach the ritual (83): 83) And know that there is no conflict in that it is possible to carry the memorizer on what the father of a Muslim said, but he said: It is not possible to carry it on the authority of the argument that the matter is the same Here, and the clouds are a visitor on the day of resurrection, so his answer is that that is not on the way of the mandate, but rather on the path of distress and disgrace, so why did you say?The third question: Reading: (on the day we reveal) with the noun and (reveal) with the transparent metaphor from the construction of the risk and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb of all, and the verb of all, and the verb, and the verb of all, and the verb, For the state, that is, the day the situation or the hour is tightened, as it says: The warls reveal its leg on the metaphor.And it is read (revealing) with the guaranteed and broken sheen from revealing if he enters into the revelation, and from it I reveal the man, so he reveals if he turned.* * His Excellency said: They invite the prostration, so they do not seek humor, whose eyes are humiliated by humiliation, and they were invited (P-85) to prostration.Know that we have indicated that they do not invite the prostration to worship and action, but it is tired and eclipse on the purpose of the prostration in the world, then the case of the prostration, then it is the case The capacity is caused by the prostration, and it turns between them and between the obedience until their escape increases and their regrets of what they have been exhausted in it, and they were involved in them Performed and joints.Al -Jubayi said: When he devoted to obedience to the hereafter, this indicated that they were in the world.The ability to faith does not happen except the state of faith.And the answer to it: that the knowledge of God is that it does not believe in the existence of the existence of faith and collection between the two opponents is referred, so the obituary in the world is also unnamed.As for his saying: humiliating their sight, it is one of his saying: (They do not be able Their money is like the servant, who has been presented with him, for he is a humiliation between people, and he said: They were invited to the prostration while they were safe They call for prayers with ears and residence, and they were valid for prayer So, and those who deny this hadith we will study them from where they do not know, know that he is up to the disbelievers, when the infidels are afraid of the greatness of the day of the day of the day of the day He has, and in his capacity from the oppression, he said: He drew me and for him, he wants both to me, so I will suffice him, as if he says: O Muhammad, I will give you a long time.And I am between me and between him, for I am a scholar with what must be done with him, and a loyalty to that, Then he said: We will study them, it is said: I will be able to do so if this is a dedication to it, so that it is required, until it is involved in it.And his saying: Whoever does not know, Abu Rawq said: We will study them, that is, whenever they are guilty, the guilt of our newness for them is a blessing, and we forgot them.Getting to be the one who does not feel that it is a stream, and it is the one who is upon them; Because they calculate it, preferring them to the believers, and it is in the truth because of their destruction.
