The Quranic researcher (P-147) (Surah Al-Fajr) thirty vessels made in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Passion, the Live Ten, the Effects, the Witr, and the Layl A stone in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Passion, and for the tenth of the night, the lips, the teeth, and the night.It is imperative that there is either religious, religious, such as being a splendid states of al -Tuhidah, or a minimum, a minimum, which is necessary, or the gap, or the gossip, For the sake of what we mentioned, they differed in the interpretation of these things that are severely disagreeing, so every one is pleased with what the greatest arrogance saw in the debt, and more in the debt.As for his saying: and the dawn, they mentioned in it a face: one of them: what was narrated from Ibn Abbas that the immorality is the good morning, so it is the exaggeration of the good morning, With it, because the night and the appearance of the night and the spread of the people and the sailors of the tallness of the birds and the insolent in the request of livelihood, and that is the problem They are their graves, and there is a lesson for those who contemplate, and this is as his saying: and the morning if he travels [Al -Muddathir: 34] and he said in another position, and the morning if it is breathless [18] In his form, he is an actor for him, so he said: The possibility is the phase [Al -Anam: 96] and among them is those who are intended for all the day, except that it is indicated by the custody of the whole: And the day, if it is evacuated [Al -Layl: 2].And the second: that what is meant is the same prayer of the dawn, but it was divided with the prayer of the dawn because it is a prayer in the openness The Qur’an was a witness [Al -Israa: 78], meaning the angels of the night and the angels of the day in the prayer of the morning.And the third of it: that it is a certain day of a day, and on this saying, they mentioned its faces: the first: that the day of the day is the day The Arabs do not leave the pilgrimage while it is a great day that the human comes in it with the kinship, as if the pilgrim wants to approach the sacrifice of himself The kinship, as he said: “We and we have fled with great sacrifice [Al -Asfat: 107].The second: He wanted to perform the pilgrimage, because he had a saying by his saying: for a tenth night, and because he is the first month of this (p-148) worship.The third: What is meant is the dawn of the forbidden, I swear by it because it is the first day of every year, and when there are many things that are many of the things, such Zakat and the reckoning of the account with the peoples of the people, and in the news that the greatest of the months with the forbidden God, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said: The dawn of the Sunnah is the forbidden The forbidden dawn.And its boots: it is my mean With the dawn of the eyes, from which the water is exploded, and in it the life of creation, but it is said: for a tenth night, it has two questions: the first question: God is with him because it is for a specialist with a pretext that does not get otherwise, and the denial is indicative of the great grace.The second question: they mentioned in it a face: one of them: it is the ten days of the Hajj because it is the days of the preoccupation with this human being in the sentence, and in the news: there are no days Ten days.And the second: It is the tenth of the one who is forbidden from his first to the end, and he alerts him on the honor of those days, and in it on the day of Ashura and his fasting from the grace of what he returned.And the third of it: It is the twenty -long one from the month of Ramadan, God Almighty has divided it for its honor and in it the night of destiny, as in the news, they asked for it in the twenty -first, and it is the one who is the one who is the last The twentieth entered the Ramadan of the symbolism of the balance, and his family wakes up, that is: stop from the gathering and command his family to glorify, and his saying: and the lips: The first question: the lips and the tendon, which is called by the Arabs, the luxury, the Zaka, and the public of the husband, and the individual, Yunus said: The people of the high say: the time is in the time Hurry.And she says: And it is a fracture of them with them, and you say it, I will give it to him, that is, I made it and a good, and it is his saying to him, peace and blessings be upon him.And the fracture of the readers of good and the people and Ibn Abbas, and the conquest is the readers of the people of the city, which is a Hijazi language.The second question: the interpreters are forced to interpret the lips and the teeth and multiply in it, and we see what is close: one of them: that the lip of the day of the day, the day of the day, the day of the day Rather, God has divided them with them to honor them, but the day of Arafa is the one who is on the authority of the pilgrimage, as in the hadith: “Hajj is a knowledge.” More than the pilgrims are more than the exhibits, the throat, and the throw, and it is narrated: the day of the magic is the day of the greatest pilgrimage, so when these two days were made with this, this is not the same.With them.And the second: that the days of honor are the days of the rest of the pilgrimage, so they are mourning days.203] The lips are the day after the day of the sacrifice, the time is the third day, and whoever goes to this saying, he said: He carried the elevation and the one who is on the authority Jahin: The first: that the Eid and the definition of income in the twenty, so it is obligatory to be intended by the intercession and the teeth other than them.The second: that some of the pilgrims will get in these days, so the memorization is carried on this, this benefits the oath with all the days of the works Satisfaction.And the third of it: Al -Water, Adam, was intercession with his husband, and in a narration, the lips are the same as Adam and Hawa, and the Tir is God Almighty.And its seed: the time is what was and a rhetoric of the prayers like the Maghreb, and the lips were not raised from it, Amr ibn al -Husayn narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: I swear by God because prayer is next to faith, and its ability and its place are not hidden from worship.Fifth: The lips are the creation of all of its words: And from everything that we created for two youngsters [Al -Dharaiyat: 49] and his saying: And we have been blessed with you [the Prophet: 8] The speakers: It is not correct to say: the time is God for his faces: the first: that we have shown that his saying: the lips and the tire of his estimation: P-149) To be intended with the tire of the picker, so he prolonged what they said.The second: that God is exalted and does not remember with his others on this face, but his remembrance glorifies until he is distinguished from otherwise, and it is narrated that he is the one who is peace and peace be upon him.And his Messenger “Fanhah”, and said: “Say God, then His Messenger” said: And what was narrated that he is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: And its sixth: that something of the creatures is not separated from his universe and a ritual, as if it is said: I swear by the Lord of the individual and the husband from the creation of the creation, and the creation of the creation, and the creation of the creation, and the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so the creation of the creation, so it is the creation of the creation.And his counterpart is his saying: I do not swear by what you see and what you do not see [Al-Haqaqa: 38-39].And its seven: the lips are the grades of paradise, which are eight, and the teeth is the fire of the fire, which is seven.And eighth: the lips are the characteristics of creation, such as knowledge, ignorance, capacity, curtains, will, dedication, life, life, and death.Ignorance, destiny, without reward, unjust.And the ninth: what is meant by the lips and the teeth: the same number, as if it was divided by the account that must be created from it, and it is in the house of the book and the one who said: He taught the pen, the human knowledge did not know [Al -Alaq: 5, 4], and he said: Al -Bayan taught him [Rahman: 4].Likewise, with the calculation, the timing of worship, days and months know, he said: Shams and the moon with a reckoning [Rahman: 5] and said: Let you know the number of the Sunnahs and the one who created the one who created the one who created [Yunus: 5].And Istnhah: The fighter of the intercessor said is the days and the loyalty, and the tendon is the day that is not after him while he was the Day of Resurrection.Haddi is twenty: The lips are every prophet who has a proverb, like Muhammad, Ahmad, Al -Masih, Jesus, Yunus, and the Nun and the Tir, every prophet who has one name.The second is twenty: the lips are Adam and Hawiya, and the tendon is a gossip.The third is the twenty -year -old.The verses of the nine that were given Moses in his saying: We have come to Moses, nine signs of evidence [Al -Israa: 101].The fourth is the fourth: the lips are back days, and the teeth of their loyalty to the words of the Almighty: seven for the days of the days of Hasum [Al -Haqa: 7].The fifteenth: the twenty -ethnic body of the highest saying: He made in the sky a bouquet [Al -Furqan: 61] and the seven cries.The sixth: the month of the month that meets thirty one day, and the month of the month that completes nine and ten days.The four -fourth: the lips of the members and the heart of the heart.The eighth is ten: the lips of the two lips and the tasty, the tongue said: And the tongue and two lips [Al -Balad: 9].The ninth is the tenth: the two prostrations and the rak'ah.The twentieth: the height is the gates of paradise because it is eight, and the chapters of the fire because it is seven, and know that the one who indicates the appearance, that the shivering and the righteousness, God Almighty, and all of this face that we have mentioned is an imprisonment, and the back is not a notice of it with something of these things on the one who is aware of the one who is in the authority of the people ﷺ Or a gathering of the people of interpretation is judged that it is the intended, and if it does not prove, then the words should be on the way of the permissibility, not on the face of the cut I carry the words on all because the thousand and the blame are in the lips and the tendon benefits the general.As for the saying of the Exalted: The night, if he goes, then he has two questions: 17] Its secret is its past and its inclusion, or it is said: its secret is the path in it, and Qutdah said: If he goes, that is, if he comes and accepts.The second question: the most involved is that it is not intended for a night specialized, but the general is with the evidence The grace of God with the punishment of the night and the day and the disagreement of their merits on (P-150) creation is great, so it is correct that it is divided by it because it is in it that it is in it.A wise man who is a wise, a scholar of all the information, and a fighter said: It is the night of the ritual, and he said: If he goes, that is, if he is pleased with him, as it is said: a night is a sleeping night, and there is no one who is a sleepless night Sahir for the slope of the slope in it, and it is a night that the secret falls in the first of it when the payment is from the nations to the clouds, and in the last of it, as it was narrated that it was upon him the prayer and peace be upon him.His family is in this night, but it is permissible for the Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, after half of the night.The third question: Al -Zajaj said: It is read if it is easy to prove the ya, then he said: He deleted it, he loved me because it is a separator and the communities are deleted from the yat Farah: The Arabs may delete the ya and be satisfied with the breaking of what before it, and sought: The faction is in the faction, the first, then it was said: Why was the choice to be deleted if it was in a separation or a rhyme, and the letter from the same word, then it is necessary The calf of the forefathers, and it was not deleted?Abu Ali replied and said: The saying in that is that the communities and the stances are the position of standing and the stand is the position of change.With the weakness, the place, and the ram of the movement, in which these letters, similar to the Ziyah, changed, and the one who has proven the ya in the “Yusra” The verb is not deleted from it in standing as it is deleted in the names as a judge and gas, saying: He spends and I spend, so I will make the yaa and not be deleted.And the Almighty said: Is there a division in which there is a stone in which there are two questions: A mind and forbidden because he is reasonable and forbidden and a habit of statistics, which is the firm.They said that I made a stone on the man, and on this, the mind was called a stone because it is forbidden from the curtain from the stone, and it is forbidden from the thing with the light in it.The second question: His saying: Is there a divorced oath and what is meant by him is to confirm as he mentioned a brilliant Hajj, then he said: Is it while he mentioned his Hajj?The meaning is that whoever has a heart knows that what God has divided with them is from these things in which there are miracles and diligents of the neutrality On his uncle.The judge said: This verse indicates what we have said: The division is located in the Lord of these things, because this verse indicates that this is exaggerated in the division.It is known that the exaggeration in the oath is only in the division of God, and because the forbidden has been replied by the fact that the sane person is inhabited by these things.
