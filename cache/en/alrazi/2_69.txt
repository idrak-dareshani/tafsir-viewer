The Quranic researcher, and his saying is the Almighty: The views are easy, so the meaning is that this cow is good for its color, it is easy to look at it, the good said: Because the Arabs are called the yellow, its counterpart is the saying of the exalted in the characteristic of the smoke: as if it is a whistle of zero [the messengers: 33], that is, the black, and the abandonment of this.The yellow is not understood by the bonds, and it was not a right in it, and also the blackness is not forbidden by the juice, but it is said: the yellow is a lump and a bond of God The secret, it is a pre -emptive state that is exposed to the crops, knowledge, or belief in the fact that something is delicious or fool.Then, he is the highest, he told their third question, which is the saying of the Almighty: They said, "Call your Lord to us, show us what the cows are similar to us, and if God wills, God wills: The first: Al -Hassan said about the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: “And the soul of Muhammad in his hand, if they did not say that God wills, will be between them and between them,” Calling with this word is a delegate in every work that he wants to obtain, and for that, God said to the praise of Muhammad ﷺ: Do not say anything that I am [Al -Kahf: 23], and in which it is useful for God and the crowning of the matter to Him, and the confession is with his ability and the perpetrator of his will.The second question: Our companions were invoked with this that the tunnels with their families are intended for God Almighty.And then, he does not remain for their saying if God wills.As for the words of our companions, it may be commanded by what he does not want, then he will say to our saying if God wills help.The third question: the dismissed that the will of God be transcended by his words, with his saying: God wills from Juda: the first: that the first of the words of God.Hadith.The second: It is that it is a relationship with the arrival of the waters of the will, when the groom did not get the same, it is not necessary that it will not be the will.Let us return to the interpretation, but the saying of the Almighty: shows us what is in the question that is mentioned, which is that our saying: What is the request of the truth of the truth, and the slander, The difference is the difference, so how is this answer as a custody of the question?His answer may be presented.As for the saying of the Almighty: The cows are similar to us, so the meaning is that the cows that are woven with the collaborators and the zero are many, so it was spoken to us, which is the slander of it, With the widening and slurring of the vitality in the sheen and [reading], it is similar, similar and similar.As for the saying of the Exalted: If God wills, they will be guided, in his face, and the coffin, the lock is mentioned: one of them: I will be with the will of God We guided the cows that are taught to sacrifice it when we get its descriptions, which it is distinguished by what it is.And the second: If God wants to know it with the leadership of us in the Bayan, we will guide it.And the third of it: If God wills this guidance in our exclusion in the question about the descriptions of the cow, that is, we hope that we are on a delusion while we do it from this search.And he pushed it: We will walk with the fighting of God if you describe this cow to what it is distinguished by it, then the one who has answered, then God answered, asking them, and he said: A humiliation that enriches the earth and its saying: There is no attribute to a cow in the sense: a cow other than humiliation in the sense that it is not humiliated to the kneeling and the excitement of the land (p-112) (p-112) It is necessary for it to be the one who is the first of the exile, and the second is more for the first affirmation; Because the meaning is not humiliating, it is evaluated and watered on the fact that the two verbs are two attributes of humiliation, as if it was said, there is no humiliating and legitimate humiliation, and the sentence of the saying is that the humiliation is that there is no Including, so that the Almighty indicated that it does not enrich the earth and does not water the plow, because these two work appears with them the shortage.As for the saying of the Almighty: a Muslim who has faces: one of them: from the signs, it is divorced.And the second: One of the effects of the developed deed.And the third of it: a Muslim, that is, a brutality sent from the love.And its booster: a Muslim from the thing that is the difference of its son Fragile is not useful, but the first person carries it on peace from the signs and the memorizers requires that because that it benefits the full peace of the heart and the standards, and the knowledge of it Seeking the phenomenon with the permitting that the inner be with his disagreement because his saying: a Muslim if we are pleased with it that it is a Muslim from the signs, so we do not know But we know it from the way of the phenomenon: as for the saying of the Almighty: there is no thing in it, so what is meant is that its whistling is pure, uninterrupted by the pads of the colors, because the cow is the sake of the cow.This is if the yellow is more in its more, then he wanted to show the general of that by saying: There is no thing in which it was narrated that it was the whistling of the righteousness, Long -colored.Then God Almighty told them that they were standing at this Bayan and they were confined to him, and they said: Now you have come to the truth, that is, now that you are the cow of the cow, because it is a cow from the poverty of it.It is not humiliated by work.In fact, and this is a weakness for the use of what is meant now, the truth of what we commanded is until it was distinguished from others, so it is not unbelievers.
