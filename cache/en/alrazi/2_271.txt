The researcher is the Almighty: If you seem to be charity, then they will be hidden, and if you are hidden and the poor, then it is better for you and disbelieves from you from your goodness and what you do.Know that he is the highest among the first that the spending is from what follows and the harm follows, and it is what is not like that, and the ruling of each one of the two divisions is mentioned, then the second is the second, then the second is the second, then the second is the second, then the second is the second, then the second is the second.Good and a new one, and the ruling of each one of the two divisions was mentioned, and he mentioned in this verse that spending may be an apparent and may be hidden, and the one who has been hidden, and the one is from the one, and it is a hidden one He said: If you start charity, then it is in the verse: The verse.The second question: the charity is called the unjust and the nafah said: Take from their money a charity that purifies them [the repentance: 13] and he said: Rather, the righteousness is for the sake of And he said ﷺ: “The agreement of the woman is a charity“ and the zakat is only called on the grounds.And the talisman, and its saying: a man who looked at the look, and the meeting is true, and they are strangled by the fighting, and so and so is true of the affiliation, and this is the void of the valley, and the thing is true Tell him if he is informed of it on the face, which is a complete correctness, and the friend is called a friend of his sincerity in the affiliation, and the righteousness is called a friend of the time It is complete, and God called the Zakat al -Zakat is a charity because the money with it is correct and completed, for it is the reason for either the money of the money and its survival, or that it is inferred from it, and it is the best of it.In it.The third question: the original in its saying: the blessings of what is yes, except that one of the two Maimin in the other is bound by the other, then there are three directions from the one who said: Bazar on the authority of “Naan” by breaking the noun and the eyes of the eye, which is the choice of Abu Ubaid, he said: Because it is the language of the Prophet ﷺ when he said to Amr ibn al -Aas: “ The righteous, “This is how it was narrated in the hadith with the eyes of the eye, and the grammarians said: This requires the collection between the two hills, and it is not permissible, except when the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be And softness, nodes: a dirt and a young man; Because what is in the letter of tids becomes a mobilization of the movement, and as for the hadith, it is because when the sense indicates that it is not possible to collect between these two people.He spoke to him and signed in the eye, a light, on the way to seize.The second reader: Ibn Katheer read and a farmer with a pharaoh, a spray and a sacrifice in the narration of Hafs.To investigate the eye, they move it like The movement of what accepted it.The second: That this is a language of those who say “Naam” by breaking the noun and the eye, Sibuyeh said: It is the language of this.The third reader: It is the reader of the reader of the readers, “then it is“ the opening of the noun and the broken eye, and whoever reads this reading, then he came with it, ”he said: Tarfa: (P-64) ؎ We are happy with the exclusive matter.This is a matter of this to be said: “What” in the interpretation of something; Because “what is“ is a denial, then he represents it with the denial, and the evidence is that “what“ is a disgust With it; Because the supply after “what is“ it is, and the word ”is“ a single, and the individual is not a link to what; And if this saying is prolonged, then we say: “What“ we are erected on the distinction, and the ability: Yes, it is the reason for the rituals, so the added of the word is omitted.* * * The fifth question: they disagreed that what is meant by the sincere is mentioned in this verse: the volume, the duty, or their group.The first saying, which is the saying of the most, is that what is meant is the charity of the volume, they said: Because the hidden is in the charity of the volume, the best, and the appearance in the zakat is better The first research: that the most preferred in giving the honesty of its hidden or its emergence.Let us first remember the faces indicating that his hide is better: the first: that it will be a distance from the listening and the hearing, he said ﷺ: And the speaker with his sincerity is not doubt that he is asking for hearing, and the one who is given in full of people is asking for luxury, hidden and silence is the one who has been saved from them.The concealment, and strive that the taking not to them, so some of them would throw it in the hands of a blindness, and some of them throw it on the way of the poor, and in the place of the rituals of the rituals, and it does not see it.And some of them used to draw him in the dwarfs of the poor while he was asleep, and some of them were connected to the hand of the poor on the hand of others, and the one who is intended for all the unparalleled about the ray and the hearing and the hearing; Because the poor, if he knows the guest, he has obtained the luminous and the one with the knowledge of the mediator.And the second: that if he hides his charity, he did not get him among the people, a month, praise, and greatness, then that was the hardship of the soul, and it is obligatory to be a reward.And the third of it: His saying ﷺ: “The best of the charity is the effort of the fold to the poor in a secret.” And he also said: “ It appeared to be transferred from the secret and was written in Al -Alani, so if you spoke with it, it is transmitted from the secret and the globe, and it was written in the life.The day of resurrection in his shadow on a day, there is no shadow except his shadow: one of them is a man who believes with a charity, so he did not know the north of what he gave him to his right.Lord.And its elevation: that the emergence requires the harm of the release to take from its faces, and the concealment does not join that, so the hideout should be the first, and the two people of those who are in the face of the one who is the one: This is the presentation of the poor and the purification of its poverty, and perhaps the poor is not satisfied with that.The second: that in the emergence of the lack of the paragraph from the form of defamation and the number of the question, and God Almighty praises that in the verse that comes after this verse, and it is the one who says: The richness of defamation, knowing them with their pain, do not ask people to be a curtain [Al -Qar: 273].And the third: that people may be denied by the poor, taking that charity, and they think that he took it with the exploitation of it, so the poor falls into the dome.And the quarter: that in the purification of the giving, then the permission to take and insult to it, and the sacrifice of the believer is not permissible.And the fifth: The charity is a neighbor of guidance, and peace and blessings be upon him said: That charity is something to (P-65), its present parts, and the poor falls due to the convergence of that charity in the verb of what is not empty, so this is a sentence.Hide the charity of the voluntary.As for the face in the permissibility of the ritual shock, then it is that if a person knows that if he appears, then it becomes a reason for the creation of creation in it in giving the charity, then he will be given, then he will be fulfilled.The case is this to be more preferred, and Ibn Omar narrated from the Prophet ﷺ He said: The wise man: The human being, if he comes with a work while he hides it from creation, and in itself a lust is that the creation is seen from that, and he pushes that lust, so that the lust is the same.The vision of creation, and the heart is denied and pushed, for this human being in the seat Even from God, upon them, with the types of his gifts, then they met their hearts that the lights of the knowledge are, and they went from them and the soul of the soul, because the rituals of them are from them.In the sailor of the greatness of God Almighty; If he did a work of transmission, it is not necessary for it to be directed, because the lust of the breath has been overlooked, and the soul is made, then it was added, so if it is not, then it is in it.It is a slave of it, so this is a servant who has full of himself, and he sought to complete it otherwise, to be complete and above the completion, do not you see that God is the same as the one who is in the righteousness of God The Most Merciful, and it is obligatory for them to be the highest in the paradise.For the righteous, the imam [Al -Faraqan: 74] and praising the nation of Moses, peace be upon him, and he said: And from the people of Moses a nation who guides the truth and with him they are modified [159] He said: You were the best of a nation that was brought out to people who commanded the well -known and forbade the denunciation [Al -Amran: 110] Then the one who is the one who said: They guide the truth and with it they modify [Al -Araf: 181] So the imams of the guidance, the flags of religion, and the pillow of creation are guided by them to go to God.If it was said: If the matter is about what you mentioned, then the hide is likely to be hidden in his saying: If you hide it and the poor, then it is good for you.And the answer is from Wajin: The first: We do not surrender that his saying: It is the best for you to benefit the survival, for it is necessary for the meaning that the giving of the honesty is the case The sentence of obedience, so that it is intended for him to be in itself in itself, good and obedience, not that the intended of it is the way of the hypothesis.And the second face: We gave us that what is meant by it is likely, but what is meant by the verse is that if the situation is one in the abnormal and the hide, then the best is the hide, then if it is a matter He did not go away from hiding.* * * The second research: that the emergence in giving the obligatory zakat is better, and it is indicated by his face Cursedness is its collapse.And the second: that in its purification, the denial of the accusation is, “It was narrated that ﷺ was the most of his prayers in the house except the boundary.” So if the judgment of the prayer is lost and the prayer is in the way of the prayer, the prayer of the prayer is in the prayer The accusation, so in zakat.And the third of it: that its emergence joins the hurry to the command of God, the Exalted, and its deposit, and its concealment is delusional that the flames are left to the performance of the duty, so the appearance was in the first one, this is what he said.The intended (P-66) with the authenticity mentioned in this verse is the truth of the volume.The second saying: It is the saying of the good morning that the memorial is a loyal to the duty and the delegate, and he answered the saying of those who said: The emergence in the duty is the first of the face of the first: It is necessary to purify the amount of money, and perhaps this was a reason for the harm, that the injustice is reassured in his money, or with the abundance of his envy, and if he is the best of him, he has no money for him.The hide of zakat is the first.The second: that this verse was descended in the days of the Messenger ﷺ, and the companions were not accused in the blessing of zakat, so it was not a crime that was hidden from the zakat for them; Because it is a distance from lime and hearing, but now when you got The accusation was the first of the accusation.The third: We do not hand over the significance of his saying: It is better for the hypothesis and has preceded his two.As for the saying of the Almighty: If you hide it and its poor, it is better for you, then the concealment is the opposite of the purification and its saying: (So it is) as a hide.Because the verb indicates the source, that is, the concealment is better for you, and we have mentioned that his saying: It is better for you that it is possible for you to be the one that is what is said that it is in the goodness of it.The porridge is better, and that it is intended to be likely, but it is a condition of exaltation in the fact that the concealment is better than that the poor will be given it; Because the closer hideout is that it is amended by zakat from the poor, to the loved ones and friends who are not investigating the zakat, and for that, and for that is the condition The poor, and the meaning of the believer, is the one who is the subject of the charity, so he becomes a scholar with the poor, and he will distinguish them from others, then if this is from it, then it is from it The righteousness, then it hid it.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: It is atoned for you from your bodies, and it is in it: And from it it is said: He disbelieves from his right, that is, the sins of the mutation will be rejected by the sincerity of the charity, and the disbelief is a barren because of what he obtained from the sin.The second question: Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr and Asim read in the narration of Abu Bakr, “Nakfar” with the color and the raising of the Arabs, and in which it is: one of them: one of them: After the fulfillment.The second: that it is a beginner, omitting, that is, and we will atone.The third: It is a sentence of verb and effective, starting with a disconnection of the one before it.The second reader is the reader of Hamza, a benefit, and the whispers with the tenderness and the reward, and its face is to carry the words on the position of his saying: it is good for you, for it is good for you.You see that if he said: And if you hide it, it will be greater for your dates, he would be rewarded, and it appears that his saying: It is better for you in the place Al -Jazzah is a reader who reads (whoever misleads God, then he does not guide him and warns them) [Al -Arif: 186] with the reward.The third reader is the reader of Ibn Amir and a thunder of the capital of “expiation” with a fulfillment, the breaking of fulfillment and the raising of the Arabs, and the meaning: God disbelieves or disbelieves the hide The uniqueness of the individuals, and it is his saying: And God is what you do, and his saying (disbelieve) will be more likened to what is after him, and the first they answered and said: No First of all, then the individuals were mentioned secondly, as it came to the memorizers of the individuals first, and the collection is second in his saying: Glory be to the one who caused his servant to be a night [Al -Asra: 1] [Al -Asra: 2].And the owner of the “scout” transferred a “luxurious reader” and atone for “a light”.It is permissible and the verb.Fifth readings, and it is the reader of goodness with the purpose of the ritual and the addition of “that” and its meaning: if you hide it, it is better for you, and that we disbelieve from you, then it is good for you.(P-67) The third question: in the entry of “from” in his saying: From your bodies, it is a face: one of them: the meantic: and we disbelieve from you, some of you, because all of them are all.Some of them are atoned and then the words of the words in that bit, because his evangelism is like the seduction of its composition if he knows that it is atoning, but it is obligatory for the servant to be in every Please, and that is with the thumb.The second: to be “from” in the sense of the sake of the sake, and the meaning: and we disbelieve for you for the sake of your sins, as you say: I struck you from the misfortune of your creation, that is, for the sake of this.The third: It is an increased link, such as its saying in it from all the fruits [the cow: 266] and the estimation: and we disbelieve all your bodies.The first is the first and it is the most correct.* * * Then he said: And God is what you do is an expert, and it is a sign of the precedence of the charity of the secret on the globalism, and the meaning is that God is aware of the secret and the globe, but you want His illnesses, you have met with the secret of the secret, so what is the meaning of the slave!As if they were caught by this words to hide, to be a distance from the life.
