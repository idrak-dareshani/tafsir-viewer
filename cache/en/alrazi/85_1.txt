The Quranic researcher (P-104) [Surah Al-Baraj] Twenty and Meccan Ayati ﷽ and the sky with brokers and the day of the back and witnessed and witnessed.The Prophet ﷺ and his companions from harming the infidels, and how to do so is that it is the exalted, indicating that the path of the righteous nations was like that.Pharaohs and the same as a precious, and that was concluded that all the disbelievers were in the denying, then he commented this face with the face of another, and it is the one who said: The surrounding [Al -Buruj: 20] mentioned a third face, which is that this is something that is stressed in the urbanized wave, which is forbidden.Surah.﷽ And the sky with the routers, the day, the witness, and the witness, I know that in the brokes three sayings: one of them: that it is the ethnic, and it is the same Because it is in the wondrous of the wisdom, and that is because the thorns of the sun has in it and there is no doubt that the reconciliation of the lower world is connected to the thorns of the sun, so it is so that it is so.Al -Jaba’i: This is the right and signed on the worldly sky because the rose is in it, and I know that this is a mistake and its investigation is mentioned in the saying of the heavens: With the adulterer of the cups.And the second: that the rugs are the homes of the moon, but the oath is good for it because of the path of the moon and its movement of wondrous effects.And the third: that the bones are the bones of the curtains, they were called the brokers of their appearance.As for the day, the day is the day of resurrection, it was narrated by Abu Hurairah from the Prophet ﷺ.And slamming her output.As for the witness and the witnesses, the two interpreters have been forced in it, and the lock is the best of people in it, he said: The witness falls on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who sits on the one who is: I fix the claims and rights.The second: the witness who is in the sense of the present, as his saying: the scholar of the absence and testimony [Al -Anam: 73] and it is said: So and so is a hardship, and the pregnancy of the verse is on this If what was intended was the first, he would not have been given the martyrs about the letter of the prayer, so it is said: a witness to it, or a witness to him.This is the phenomenon, and it may be that the witnessed is the witness to which the prayer was deleted, as in his saying: The covenant was a question: On the authority of it, if you know this present, then say: If the witnesses carry us with the presence, the verse is carried out from the interpretation.One of them: that the witness is the day of resurrection, and the witness is the gathering that they are attending, and it is narrated from Ibn Abbas (P-105) and the laughter, and it is indicated by this Wajoh: The first: that there is no greatest presence than that presence, so God is the Almighty in which the first and the others create from the angels, the prophets, the gin, and the human being, and the disclosure of the memorial to the most complete name.And the second: He is the highness of the day, and it is the Day of Resurrection, then he mentioned his obstacle: The day is from the cells, and with the witnesses that are in that wondrous today.The third: that God is upholstered and described the day of resurrection by being a witness in his saying: a loyalty to those who disbelieved from the scene of a great day: People, and that is a witness of witnesses [Hood: 103] and he said: The day they invite you, so you will respond to his praise [Al -Israa: 52] and he said: If you are only a one, then they are, then they are all of them 53] And the way of their denials is either what we mentioned in the interpretation of his words, the Almighty: I learned the same as what I brought to [Al -Takwir: 14] as if it was said: and what I have seen, and he did not like it.As for the dignity in the description, as if it was said: a witness and a witness who is not folded by them, but the oath is good at the day of resurrection to the alerts of the fate, as he was the one who was the one who was the one who was the day.On the day of God, the Exalted, in which the king and the ruling, are unique, And the second: that the witnesses are interpreted at the day of the group, which is the saying of Ibn Omar and Ibn al -Zubayr: that is because it is a day that the Muslim is witnessed to the prayer.And what indicates this day is called the witnesses.The first: What was narrated by the father of Al -Daradaa said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “More to pray on the day of the Friday, for it is a day of witnesses that the angels testify.” The second: Abu Hurairah narrated that ﷺ said: “The angels bring the gates of the mosque, and they will write the people, so if the Imam comes out, it is the same“ It is only in this day, so it is permissible to be called a witness to this meaning.God Almighty said: The prayer of the prayer for the sun of the sun to the dusk of the night: [78] The angels of the night and the day they bring the time of the dawn prayer, so this prayer was called a witness to the testimony of the angels.And the third of it: that the witnesses are interpreted on the day of Arafa and the witness who is bringing him from the pilgrim and the good of the oath of the oath of the pilgrimage.It was narrated that "God Almighty says to the angels on the day of Arafa: He cries and places dust on his head, because of that, “and the evidence is that the day is known to be called that it is a martyr who said: Deep, to testify to them [Hajj: 28].And the one that is: that the witnesses will be the day of the sacrifice That is because it is the greatest of the viewer in the world, for it is the people of the honesty and the west in that day with the one who is in the place of the day Ghone of the pilgrimage.Fifth: Carrying the verse on the day of the group, on the day of the day, and the day of the sacrifice is all because it is the days The verse is general for every great day from the days of the world and for all the sitting of its maqam For the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Mutaffifin: 5-6] and he said: Fawal is for those who disbelieved from a major witness to a great day [Maryam: 37] and it is indicated by the validity of this interpretation of the ritual of the ritual On the denial, then it is necessary for that to be in the sense that the intention is that it did not fall into a day with his eyes, so it will be known.As for the first face: which is to bear the witness to those who fix the claim by saying it, so they mentioned this fate a lot.One of it: that the witness is God, the Almighty, for his saying: God witnessed that there is no god but He [Al -Imran: 18] and his saying: Say what thing is the greatest testimony of God: 19] By your Lord, it is a martyr (P-106) [Chapter: 53] and the witness is the neutrality, for his saying: God witnessed that there is no god but he is or the Prophet: And among you.And the second: that the witness is Muhammad ﷺ, and the witnessed upon him, the path of the prophet, because of his words, the Almighty: How if we come from every nation with a martyr and we have come to you.[41] And his words said: We sent you a witness [Al -Ahzab: 45].And the third of it: that the witness is the prophet, and the witnesses are the nations, because the Almighty said: How if we come from every nation with a martyr.And its elevation: that the witness is all the components and events, and the witnesses are upon him and the obligation of existence, and this is an involvement that I mentioned and I took it from the saying of this.The recipient of the witness is absent, and on this estimation, the division is located in creation and creator, industrial and obedient.Fifth: that the witness is the king, because of his saying: “Every soul came with it with a driver and a martyr [Q: 21] and the witnessed is the one.And its sixth: that the martyr is the king, and the witness to it is the human being who is witnessing his wounds on the day of resurrection, he said: The day of the witness to them And their legs [Al -Nur: 24] and they said to their groups.As for the third face: it is a building saying on the narratives, not the derived.One of them: that the witness on the day of the Friday, and the witnesses on the day The barrier on the day of resurrection, the witness on the day of the Friday, the witnesses on the day of Arafah, and the day of the Friday of God for us.Knowing, and the witness on the day of the Friday, you did not come to the sun, nor was it strange for it, in which there is an hour in which a servant does not agree with a believer who calls God, and he does not pray Sherir except for his sake of him from him.Among the people of knowledge as Alali ibn Abi is a student, peace be upon him, and Abu Hurairah and Ibn Al -Masib and Al -Hassan Al -Basri and Al -Rabi` ibn Anas, Qutdah said: God is one of the days of the world, as it speaks that the witness on the day of the group and the witnesses on the day of Arafa.And the second: that the witness on the day of the knowledge and the witnesses on the day of the sea, and that because they are the day of their greatness, and they made them one of the days of the days He brings them with faith and the fulfillment of mercy, and it was narrated that peace be upon him, slaughtering my hearts, and he said in one of them: “This is the one who testifies to me.The day of the sea will be a witness to those who attended it like that for this news.And the third of it: that the witness is Jesus for his saying, as a story about him: I was a witness to them [Al -Ma’idah: 117].And the one who has been: the witness is God and the witness is the Day of Resurrection.He predicts what they did [Al -Mujadila: 7].Fifth: that the witness is the human being, and the witness is the neutrality of his words, the Almighty: I testify to themselves, whom I did not seek your Lord.And its sixth: that the witness is the human being and the witnessed is the Day of Resurrection, but the time of the human being is a witness, so he said to him: They said: “Our witnesses” [Al -A'raf: 172] So he said: To say the day of resurrection, we were about this unaware [Al -A'raf: 172], so this is the summary of the summary, and God knows the truth of the Qur’an.
