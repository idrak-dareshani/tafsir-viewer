matter, that is, I did not come from it The verse leads to the first two, so the multiplication is limited to the meaning of the reaction, because it is as well as two of the two, each one of them says to the owner of it: I am more than one of you The cost of many is required, as the heat costs all its ages multiply his money, and he knew that the frustration and the multiplication of one
