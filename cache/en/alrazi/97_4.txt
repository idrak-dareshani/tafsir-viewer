make in it those who spoil in it and shed blood, and your father when they saw your images at the beginning They appeared the blow, and reserve that semen and the relationship, and wash their clothes from it, then how did they go to the projection and abuse, then it is up to the one who gave you the good They saw that good image kissed you and did not come to you, so the angels of what they saw in your soul, the good image, and it is the knowledge of God, and I will love you, so I will love you, so I will love you They said it first, for this is what is meant by his saying: the angels are revealed, so if they come to you, they will see your soul in the darkness of the night of the body, and the darkness of the power of the power They apologize for what you offer: and they ask forgiveness for those who believe [Ghaffir: 7].The second question: that its saying is up to the Almighty: the angels are revealed, and its appearance requires that all the angels be removed, then the angels have a large number of greatness For this reason, they disagreed, and some of them said: It is descending with her family to the worldly sky, for if the problem was said after it remains, because the sky is fill in it, and it is not the same.And in it a king, how is all the whole heaven?We said: The publication of the book is eliminated on the news of one, how and the narrator is that they are going down a wave, so whoever comes down and up as the people of the pilgrimage, so they are the same The Kaaba in the kidneys, but the people are between within and out, and for this reason, it is extended to the end of the dawn of the dawn, so this is mentioned by the word: Time.And the second saying: It is the choice of the most, that they go down to the earth, which is the one, because the wiseness is the desire to revive this night, and because it is a sign of the hadeeth that the hadeeth is the same The days of the days of the male and the religion, because this will obtain this night with the same as the first, and because the absolute descending is not beneficial except for The earth, then the one who said: They descended to the earth on its faces: one of them: some of them said: They go down to see the worship of the human beings, their grandfather and their dirt in the obedience.And the second: that the angels said: And we do not descend except with the command of your Lord [Maryam: 64], so this indicates that they were commanded by that descent, so it is not the same.With the permission of their Lord, and this is the verse, which is his saying: with the permission of their Lord, it is indicated that they are all permission, then give permission, and for you, and that Because they wanted us and wish for our meeting.But they were waiting for the ear, if it was said: We are the pure ones [Safaids: 165] He contradicts his saying: the angels are revealed to us: Two different.The angels have come to you until they entered you to peace and the exercise, and it was narrated from him, peace be upon him: Himmah has forgiven his sin.” And its elevation: that God Almighty made the virtue of this night in the preoccupation with his fear in the land, so they descended to the earth to release their obedience, as well Mecca to make his obedience there is more reward, and all of that is a desire for a person in obedience.Fifthly: that the human being comes with obstacles and goods at the presence of the greatest of the scholars and ugliness is better than what is in the cell, so God Almighty has revealed the angels The cost knows that it comes with obstacles in the presence of these scholars, the worshipers of the worst, so I will be complete and the shortcomings.And its sixth: that one of the people who specializes the angels with the difference of the angels, on the authority of a player that the sanctity of the one who ends up with the heavenly heaven is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The whims of the world and the air of the hereafter, and its leg in paradise and its branches under the Karsi in which there are angels in which they know their number except God worshiping God and the place Except, and the mercy and mercy were given to the believers, they will come with Gabriel, the night of the destiny, so do not remain a seat of the land, except for it, and the king of the sake of the sake And the believers, and Gabriel does not leave anyone from the people except shook them, and the mark of that is the one who spread his skin and the tenderness of his heart, and he blessed his eyes, for you are from the sake He who said three times in it: There is no god but God, he forgive him with a maid, and he escaped from the fire with a bond, and he entered Paradise with a bond, and the first of the one who is in front of the one who escapes Two wings are simplified, and they will not publish them except for that hour of that night and then call a king of king Gabriel, peace be upon him, will evaluate Jabriel and whoever is with him from the angel between the sun and the sky of the world on that day, that is busy with the supplication and the mercy of the And for those who fasted Ramadan, then they will enter the world of the world, then they will be a shackly shackling, so they will be gathered to them, the sky of the sky, and they will ask them.A woman is a woman, until they say: So what did so and how did you find it?They say: We found it the first year of worshiping, and in this year, it is a priority, and so was the first year of the first, and this year is worshiped, and they will stop the supplication for the first For the second, we found so and so, and so, and so, and so prostrating, so they were like that on their day and their night until they escalated the second sky, and so do so, so they do in all of them.Sadra.So the Sadra says to them: O my inhabitants, talk to me about people, for I have a truly upon you, and I love those who love God, so he remembered as a player who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the man And the names of their fathers, then the news will reach heaven, so the paradise says: Oh God, their hurry to me, the angels, and the people of the Sadra say: Amen, if this is safe, if this is safe.So we say, the greater the collection, the greater the crowd, the more of the mercy is there more, and for that, then the greatest of the crowd in the pilgrimage is the pilgrimage, there was no crime, then it was the ritual of the mercy, so the mercy is that The night of the destiny will obtain the gathering of the angels, so there was no crime.* * * The third question: they mentioned in the spirit sayings: one of them: that it is a great king, if the heavens and the lords had a single summit.And the second: a group of angels that the angels do not see except for the night of destiny, such as the flirtation that we see only on the day of Eid.And the third of it: creation from the creation of God, they eat and wear them from the angels, nor from humanity, and perhaps they serve the people of paradise.And his booster: It is impeded that he is Jesus, peace be upon him, because he is his name, then he descends in the positions of angels to recite the nation of Muhammad.Fifthly: It is the Qur’an: and also we have forgiven us from our command [Al -Shura: 52].And its sixth: the mercy (P-34) is a reciter: and do not despair from the soul of God [Yusuf: 87] by raising as if it is up to the Almighty, he says: The angels are descended and the mercy of it.Dunya happiness and the last happiness.And its sake: The spirit is the honor of the angels.And eighth: On the authority of Abu Najih: The Spirit are the memorizers and the crime, the writers, so the right of the right is written by his duty with a duty, and the owner of the north is written for the sake of the ritual Gabriel.It is devoted to the remembrance of the increase in its honor, as if it is an adequate saying: the angels in the palm and the spirit in the palm.As for his words, the Almighty said: With the permission of their Lord, we mentioned that this indicates that they were missing us, because it was said: How do you want us to know?We said: They do not stand on the detail of the sins.You see it, then it says: Glory be to those who appeared to be beautiful, and he was brought up to the cubic We go to them and now remember the other benefits and have it that they see the earth from the types of obedience, the things that they have seen in the world of the heavens: one of them: that the songs come from Their homes, and they make it a hospitality for the poor and the poor who eat the food of the songs and worship God, and this is a type of obedience that is not found in the heavens.And the second: that they hear where the stick is, and this is not found in the heavens.And the third of it: “It is up to the Almighty:“ Because where the singers love me from the weight of the praises.We praised us, how do I love the praise of the praises, the purification of the state of the state of the obedient, and where the disobedience is the purification of the forgiveness of the Lord of the earth and the heavens [and this is the one who is the first.] The second question: This verse is indicative of the infidelity of the angels and its counterpart is saying: We do not descend except with the command of your Lord and his saying: “No,” 27] And there is an accuracy, which is that he did not say: they are hurt, but he said: With the permission of their Lord, and it is a sign that they do not behave in behavior, except with the permission To his woman, if I come out except with my permission, then he considers the ear in every way.The third question: His saying: their Lord benefits the greatness of the angels and a criminalization of the disobedience, as if he said: They were for me, and I was forced to do so Your Lord, God who created the heavens and the earth [Yunus: 3] and he said to Muhammad, peace be upon him: when your Lord said [p.71] and his counterpart is what was narrated that Dawid said: Be Solomon, as you were for me, and the revelation sent down and said: Say to Sallalman, let me be as you were as you were to me, and it was narrated from the Imam of Al -Khal So he came out with travel to seek a guest, so if with a cloud, then you want to want the guest?It was said: Yes, and he said to the host: What do you have to have an eternity for milk or honey?So the man raised two rocks, and he struck them with the last, and he breathed, and he came out from one of them, milk, and from the other, the honey, so I liked it and said: Like that, what he has?So the revelation, my Khalili, was for us, so we were for him.* * As for his words, the Exalted: From every matter, the angels and the spirit are revealed in it for the sake of every matter, and the meaning is that each of them is one of them, but it is for the one who is one of them.Wooh: One of them: They were in many work, so some of them are for kneeling and some of them for the prostration, and some of them are in the supplication, and so is the saying in thinking and learning, And some of them for the awareness of the night of night, or to surrender to the believers.And the second: It is the saying of the most for the sake of every matter that is destined in that year of good or evil, and in it indicates that their descent was worship, so they said: What they said: What they said: they said: We descended to the ground for the same, but for the sake of every matter in which the interests of the costs are for the sake The cost of the cost in his debt and its world as if the liquid says: Who did you come?He says: What is you and this is the grace, but say: For what matter you have come because it is your luck.And the third of it: each of them read: “From every person”, that is, for every human being, and it was narrated that they do not receive a believer or a believer except that they have been blessed with him, whoever is forbidden, he said: The deadlines and livelihoods are the half of the two peoples, and now you say: That is the night of destiny?We said: On the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “God appreciates the amounts at the night of the brightness, then if the night of the destiny will hand it over to its hearts” and it was said: It is valid, and it is possible.And for the night of destiny, the things in which the good, the blessing and peace are appreciated, and it was said: It is estimated at the night of the destiny that is related to the condolences of religion, and what is in the good The night of the brightness is written in it the names of those who die and hand over to the king of death.
