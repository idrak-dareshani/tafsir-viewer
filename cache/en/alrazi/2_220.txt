Like his money from his hand is not removed, then God Almighty has descended his saying: Those who eat the money of the millions are injustice, but they eat in their stomachs: [10] You are afraid that you will not be discredited in the orphans, so you will marry what you would have from the women [the women: 3] and say it: and you will seek you in the women.You will give them what they have written and want to marry them (P-44) and weaken from the children and that you do for the time of the past Knowing [Al -Nasi: 127] and saying it: Do not approach the money of the Yatim, except with what is better [Al -Anam: 152], so that the people are left, the mixture of the orphans, In their matters, then the interests of the orphans were disappeared and their livelihood worsened, so that you were less than that on the people, and they remained, and they were confused.Take advantage of the hard -line back, and if they are left and exposed them, the life of the orphans has disappeared, so the people are confused about that.Then it is possible that they asked the Messenger about this existing, and it is possible that the question was in their hearts, and that they wish to show God to the case, so what is the case in this chapter.This is the Almighty, and it is narrated that when the verses descended, they dispersed the millions of the orphans, and they were avoided by their mixtures in everything, until it was placed for me They leave him and do not eat him until he spoils, and the owner of the Yatim was unique to him with a house, food and drink, so he grew up with the weakness of the Muslim, so he said: Rahah: O Messenger of God, all of us have homes that the orphans dwells, nor all of us find food and drink that is unique to them.This verse was revealed.* * * And others, so that it is created on science, literature and virtue;

Because what leads to his money is made by development and leadership, it is a prayer for him, so his entry is not obvious Place.And the second: the saying of those who said: The news is a pioneer to the guardian, meaning: that the salvation of their money is not compensated and no reward is better for the guardian and the greatest reward for him.And the third: that the news is domesticated to the Yatim, and the meaning is that their mixing with the weapons is better for them to relinquish them and symptoms of their mixture.The first saying is first; Because the memorization is divorced, so it is allocated to some of the bodies without some, and it is likely that it is likely to be like, and it is not permissible, so it is obligatory to carry it to the good Yatim in the same thing, and the money of money, and the phrase, so what is meant by the verse is that the interests of the reconciliation are different, and it is not lost.The yatim is to obtain the good in the world and the other for itself, and the orphan in its money and itself, so this is a universal word for this.As for his words, the Almighty: If you mix with them, your brothers are in their books: the first question: the mixture is a group in which the tendency is excused, and it is said to the The man's mixture (P-45) if he is crazy, and the rich mixer is to mix the affairs on his owner with his mind.* * * He himself, and his drinking from drinking themselves, and his dwelling on the authority of themselves.The woman is with his son, for this is the same in the good and the decisive, and the meaning: and if you mix with them with what does not include the corruption of their money, then it is permissible.And the second: that what is meant by this mixture is that they benefit from their money with the amount of what is its reward, such as that work, and those who say from them, and those who say from them.The values ​​were rich or a chain of transmission, and among them who said: If the value was rich, he did not eat from his money; Because that is a pleasure on him and the request of the reward for the obligatory deed is not permissible, and they are taken over.With his exalted saying: And whoever is rich, let him be transcendent, and whoever is a poor, let him eat with the well -known [Al -Nasa: 6].If he is pleased, then you do not explain it from the yatim, and it was narrated from the age of God, may God be pleased with him I turned away, and if I agreed, I ate a loan with the well -being, then I spent, and from Mujahid that if it is a chapter and eats the well -known, then he will not be eliminated.The third saying: that the meaning of the verse be that they mix the money of the orphans with the money of themselves on the way to the way of the partner, the condition of the sponsorship of the righteousness.And the righteous saying: It is the choice of my father, Muslim: that what is meant by the mixed mixture is in the marriage, on the part of his saying: If you are afraid that you will not be able to do in the gossip, then be the one who is the one who is.And he said: “And you will seek you in the women.One of it: This saying is a mixture for the same thing, and the partner is a mixture of its talisman.And the second: that the polytheism is inside it in its saying: Say a good for them is better and mixing on the side of marriage, and the daughters of the daughters of them did not enter into that, so the words are in this way.And the third of it: that his saying is up to the Almighty: your brothers indicate that what is meant by mixing is this type of mixing; Because the orphan, if it was not one of the Muslim children, he must be prepared for the sake of his money, as he investigated it if he is a Muslim, then he must be the one who said: Your brothers to another type of mixture.And its booster: that he said after this verse: and do not marry the companies until it believes [the cow: 221], so the meaning was that the mixture is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is In Islam, they are those who want to rejoice in them to confirm the thousand, if the yatim is from the companies, then do not do that.The third question: His saying: Your brothers, that is, understand your brothers.Al -Farah said: And if his erection was right, and the meaning is your brothers.As for his saying: God knows the spoil from the reconciliation, and it was said: The spoiler of their mothers is from the reconciliation for it, and it was said: He knows the guarantee I have a sense of marriage from the reconciliation, it means: If you appear from yourself the will of the sake On your conscience is a scholar of what is in your hearts, and this is a great threat, and the reason is that the orphan cannot be the sponsorship of the slander of itself, and it is not the same (p.He said: When no one has the right to his reconciliation, then I am sponsored, and I am the demands of his guardian, [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
