The Quranic researcher, the Almighty said: And we put you from you with your weight, which has broken your back and in it.Because you do not say that we did not put us, but the meaning of what we have explained, we have explained us, so the second was carried in the first sense, not on the appearance of the word, because it was if it was a matter It is obligatory to say: “And we will put you from you.” The second question: the meaning of the minister: the wealth of the sin, and its interpretation has passed when it is said: they carry their visits [the bee: 25] and it is like it: God is what you are offered from your sin and what you are delayed [Al -Fateh: 2].* * * As for his saying: Your back has passed, and the scholars of the language said: The origin is in it that the noon, if the beard is heard, he is heard for him, that is, the voice of the hidden, which is a hidden voice.And the righteousness, or the camel, if the bearer is heavier, is an example of what was heavily over the Messenger of God ﷺ from his visits.The following question: He took this verse from the disobedience of disobedience to the Prophet, peace be upon them.The answer to it is from two faces: the first: that those who permit the listening to the prophets, peace be upon them, carry this verse on it, it is not said: that it is said: It is great.How can this be met with listening, because we say: It was described by the ruins of the noon with its being forgiven for the severity And you feel it with his regimen on him, but he described it with that because his influence is when he goes away from him from the reward, so it is permissible for him to be so.This is the report of the words on the saying of the disgraceful and in which there is forms, which is that the forgiveness of the young and is obligated to God Almighty with the judge, and God Almighty is the Almighty in this The best, and it is known that the delegation of the duty of duty is not permissible.The second face: that this be carried on the other hand, in which there are faces: one of them: Qatada said: It was for the Prophet ﷺ sins that were preceded by him in the ignorance, He was heavily and forgiven him.And the second: that what is meant by it reduces the burdens of the prophecy that reduces the noon from taking its affairs and kept its duties and the preservation of its rights, and the sake of God.Its gravity was impressed by it by making it easy for it until it was easy for him.And the third: the minister, what was distorted by their change in the Sunnah of the Khalil.He was not able to prevent them until God strengthened him, and he said to him: that follow the mourning of Abraham [Al -Nahl: 123].And its elevation: that it is the sins of his nation, it became like a button upon him, what is the one that is made in their right until he said: And God would not be tortured by them and you are in them [Al -Anfal: 33] He prepared for him the rush in the lap.Fifth: It is with you the grace of you from the minister, which will pass your back, even if it was (P-6) The sin is a result, so he called the infidelity, and for that, “It was not narrated that he was attended by a wallet in which a burial and psalm before the mission is to hear.He only awakened it from the sun from tomorrow.And its sixth: the minister is what he suffered from the hippo and the scarecrow in the first to meet Jabril, peace be upon him, when the rak'ah took him, and he almost threw his soul from the gibs, then he is the same And he became a case that almost threw itself from the mountain of his severity.And the seven of it: The minister was what he caused from harm and insults until he almost passed his back and took his pursuit.He says: “Oh God, the guidance of my people.” And eighth: when we descended the surah after the death of my father, a student and a cheek, then their dances were on him a great button, so he put him from the wickedness He met him every king and greeted him, so the remembrance of the remembrance, so he said: We raised you your remembrance.And the ninth: that what is meant is from the wilderness and the beyond that it had before the mission, and that is that it is the money of his mind, when he looked at the greatness of God.From the numbers to the existence and gave it life, mind and types of blessings, the grace of God was said to him and almost passed his back from life, because he was upon him, peace be upon him, that he was the peace of God It was interrupted, and what was knowing that he was how to obey his Lord, when the prophecy came to him, and he knew that he was not to him to obey his Lord, and he will be obedient to him, And those conditions were easy for him, because the deprivation is not ashamed of increasing the blessings of the bid, which it met with the servitude, and the generous person is the soul, if it is not the same as the one who does not have the same.The types of servitude, for it is heavy for it, in which the neighborhood is died, so if the blessing is wrapped in the virtue of the goodness of it, it is easy for it.
