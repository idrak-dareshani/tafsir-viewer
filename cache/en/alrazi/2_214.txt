The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Or did you count that you enter paradise, and when the likes of those who were left before you are the same And those who believed with him when we support God, except that the victory of God is a closeness in the systems and Jahan: The first: that he is upholstered in the righteous verse: And God is the guidance He guides whoever is created to the truth and demands paradise, so he showed in this verse that that request does not fulfill and does not complete except with the impersonation of the hardships in the abundance, and he said: And when the same is the same as those who were left before you.The second: It is in the righteous verse when he indicated that he guided them for what they have disagreed in it from the right to his permission, showing this verse that they are after that guidance in the guidance The truth and be patient with the Ballawi, so you, O companions of Muhammad, do not fulfill the guidance in religion, except by carrying this time.And in the verse: The first question: We are excluded from the words in the words (Umm) in the interpretation of his saying, the Almighty: (p-17) or you were a martyr when he attended the mold: And that we want it to say: (Umm) is an intermediate understanding, as (what) are a precedent understanding, so it is permissible to say: Do you have a man?Come, and it is not permissible to say: a man with you is a man, but if he is in the middle, it is permissible to be caused by another, or it is not, but if it is a matter As you say: You are a man who is not described, I am ignorant of this, you do this or have you a sultan?As for the one who is not preceded by the questioning, it is like it: The book is not downloaded, there is no doubt about the Lord of the two worlds, or they say it is the one who says: 3] The estimation of the first section, and the ability: Do you believe in this or do they say it?As well as the estimation of this verse: God guided those who believed in what they have disagreed with the right to his permission, so be patient with the mockery of the people of them.They are their way, or do you think that you will enter the paradise from other than their paths?This is what was summarized by the lock, may God have mercy on him, and God knows.* * * (When) is (not) and (what) is an increase, and his Sibuyeh said: (What) is not an increase; Because (when) fall into the positions that do not fall into it (why) the man says to his friend: I present so -and -so?He says: (Whatever) and does not say: (No) is a paradise, the mighty said: If the saying says: I did not belong to Zuzid, then it is a denial of your saying: I come to you.And if he said: When he brings me, then I mean that he did not come after and I will close it.Al -Nabahah said: النال The merciful is uncomfortable that our passengers are not.We have come to our mind, as if he had done this saying: And when those who have passed away from you came before you, it is indicated that it is that there is a duties.* * * Because they came out without money, and left their homes and aspirations in the hands of the participants, and the Jews appeared to be the enmity of the Messenger of God ﷺ, so God Almighty revealed to God.You calculated and said Qutdah and Al -Saddi: I descended in the conquest of the pentagues when the Muslims hit what happened to them from the effort and sorrow, and it was as he said: [Al -Ahdab: 10] It was said: I descended in the war of one when Abdullah ibn Abi said to the companions of Muhammad ﷺ: When will you kill yourself, and you will come to you A prophet, when God has stipulated that you are families and killing?So God Almighty revealed this verse.And I know that you can appreciate the verse: Or did you believe, believers, to enter paradise with the inventory of faith in me and believe my Messenger, without what you worship.And you will be patient with patience, and that he will receive you from the harm of the infidels, from the impossibility of poverty and horizon, and the suffering of harm and misery in the living, and the hardness of the horrors in the merit of the enemy, as well Before you are the believers, and it is what is meant by his saying: And when the likeness of those who have left you before you come and the example is the example and it is the similarity, and it is two things: However, the ideal is a slight, strange or strange story that has an affair, and it is the saying of the Almighty: to God, the highest ideal [the bees: 60], that is, the righteousness.And know that in the words, it is a perpetrator: the example of the cultivation of those before you, and his saying: They have been touched by the example of the example, and it is a person who said that he said: Like?He said: The women were touched by the women, the harm, and Zluzl.As for the women, it is a name of misery in the sense of intensity, which is poverty and dwelling, and from it it is said: so -and -so in misery and severity.(P-18) As for the prosecution, it is close to it that it is the arrival of those who are harmed by the pain, the fence, and the dormitory of fear, and when the women are a dilemma of the goodness of the good The harm is a light from the opening of evil, the mouth, and the mother to it.* * * As for his saying: And they will be removed, that is, they moved with the types of scourge and the bodies.So he turned it out that you have repeated that removal, so he was a violation of his memorization of the multiplication of its meaning, and everything that was in it was repeated in which it was repeated in it, and the fulfillment of the verb, He arrived, stopped and stopped, and he less than something, that is, raised it from his position, so if it is repeated, it is said: He was close, and he was pleased with them, and they will be blessed, and they will be.What we mentioned; That is because the disagreement is not limited, but his heart is forced, and that is only said in the seat of the seat.Because the silence goes, it is necessary for them to be permissible, and what is meant is: they are afraid, and it is permissible to be obligatory, and they do not decide what they are in And fear, then it is the highest after the remembrance of these things is the remembrance of something else, and it is the end in the significance on the amount of harm, misery and misery, and he said: He said: They believed with him when the victory of God and that is because the messengers are upon them, peace be upon them.They were buried, that was the extreme end in the severity, and when the severity was attained to this great degree, it was said to them: except that the victory of God is the one who is a good thing to God So the estimation of the verse: so it was their condition until the victory of God came to them and the length of the calamity did not change them from their religion And the hardship in the request of the right, for the victory of God is close; Because it is coming, and everything is close, and this is the same as his saying: I did not count people to leave to say that they are safe and they are not fascinated and they have come from Let God know [Al -Anakbout: 2] and he said: Or did you count that you enter Paradise, and when God knows those who are ready from you and know the patient [Al -Umar] The verse is what we mentioned that the companions of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him.The wounds and the foolishness of the money and the souls are what is not hidden, so God cherished them in that and indicated that the condition of those before them in the request of religion was like that, and the misfortune, if it is a good one, Ibrahim, peace be upon him, and his meeting in the fire, and from the command of peace be upon him, and what God has traveled to him, and from the command of the path of the prophets, peace be upon them in the affliction Single of the believers.Qais bin Abi Hazim narrated, “On the authority of Khabab ibn Al -Art, he said: We doubted the Messenger of God ﷺ We did not fall from the participants.So he did not distract them from their religion, until the man is placed on his head of the reference, and he will be shouted, and he will be seen, and the man is combed with the shades of the shadow And the nerve and what is the one that is spent on that of his religion, and the mother of God, so that God will be given this matter until the passenger will walk between what is between the sane You are hurrying.* * * The looked question: Nafaa reader: (until he says) by raising the mother and the rest In the interest, and its face is that (even) if the harms are erected, it will be on two warnings: one of them: to be in the sense of: to, and in this atheism, the verb will be (Until), and who came after it was found and gone, she says: I walked until I entered it, that is: until I entered it, (P-19), the Borge and the Entry, and the one who has been lost, This verse; Because the estimation: and begged until the Messenger says, and the misfortune and the saying were found.The second: to be in the sense: Ke, as his saying: I obey God until he entered Paradise, that is: in order to enter paradise, and obedience has been found, and there was no existence, and there was no existence, It can be on this face.As for raising, I know that the verb that falls after (even) must be on the path of the story that was found, as it was reported in the case of this: And this is from his enemy [Al -Qasas: 15] and in his saying: their dumping is the mediator of his arm with the inception [Al -Kahf: 18] because this is not valid except on the way that it is in the same way.The camel drank until the camel comes to run his stomach, and the meaning: I was drinking even if those who attended there are said: The camel comes to run with his stomach The reason for the reason is the one without the cause, as your saying: I walked until I entered the country.It is necessary that the traffic and the income have been glorified and glorified, and it is necessary for the traffic to be found, and the income is after it was not found.This is the words in the reporting of the position and the direction of the raising, and know that the most pronounced the monument; Because the lifting of the raising is not valid unless we make the words a story of those who tell it the state of its fall, and the readers ’readings do not need this exhibition, so it is not the same.* * * Fifth question: In the verse, it is that it is how it is appropriate for the seized Messenger with the health of God and the return of God and his return to say on the path of the one who is the one who is the one?The answer to it is from his faces: one of it: that it is a messenger that is not forbidden to hurt from the good of the performances.Perhaps your soul is your soul, not to be believers [Al -Shua’ar: 3] and the Almighty said: Even if the messengers are desirable and they thought that they had lied, they came to them, so we will be blessed.If his heart was narrowed and his tricks say, and he had heard from God, he was blessed, that he would support him, except that he did not appoint him to the time in that, he said when he is a little If he knew the closeness of the time, his concern is removed and his heart is, and his heart, and who indicates the validity of this is that he said in the answer: that the victory of God is the righteous, then the answer is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one On that the question was about the nearby, and if the question was that he was on the authority of that there is victory or not?It was not this The answer is to be ahead of that question, and this is the appointed answer.The second answer: It is the Almighty about the Messenger and those who believed that they said a saying, then he mentioned two words: one of them: when is the victory of God.The second: that the victory of God is close, so it is obligatory to support each one of these two words to one of you who are mentioned.For those who believed, they said: When is the victory of God and the Messenger ﷺ He said: Except that the victory of God is close.They said: And this is a counterpart from the Qur’an and poetry: As for the Qur’an, he said it: And from his mercy, he made you the night and the day, so that they will be rewarded for it, and they will be reluctant [Al -Qasas: 73] The meaning: Let them live in the night and seek from his grace during the day, and as for the poetry, he said the lighthouse And the rhetoric and the bald mushroom, so that it is similar to the depression of the humid and the bald mill of the clothes, so this is an answer that is mentioned by a people and it is a very costly cost.The sixth question: except that the victory of God is a relative, it is possible that there will be an answer from God Almighty for them, as they said: When (P-20) is the victory of God, so they will be the words of their words.The victory of God, then God said at that: except that the victory of God is a closeness and it is necessary for that to be a saying of a people from them, as if they said: when they said: when they said: when they are.So they knew that God does not rise to their enemy on them, and they said: Not that the victory of God is a close proximity, so we have patience, our Lord, with your promise.If it was said: His saying: except that the victory of God is a closeness that is required in the right of everyone who has the right to be seen that he knows that he will be wrapped in its lords, and that is so.We said: It is not possible for this to be the characteristics of the Prophet, peace be upon them, and this can be a year in the right of all; For everyone who is in a loudness, then it is necessary for anyone who is two things: either to be relieved of him, or if he dies, and if he dies, he will come to those who do not care about his command, and he does not.The victory, but he made it close because the death is close.
