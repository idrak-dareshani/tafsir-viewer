The researcher is the Almighty: Sometimes they bought it for themselves to atone for what God has descended in order to descend from God for his grace to whom he is overwhelmed Anger and for the disbelievers is a humiliating torment, I know that searching for a basis of a basis that only obtains in the issues: the first question: the origin of the blessings of the first As our saying: “Know”, but what was second (P-166) was a hall, which is broken, in which four languages ​​may be permissible: the first: at the original, I mean the first and the second.The second: the first follower of the second, which is that it is to break the noun and the eye, and also it is said: a goodness by breaking the fulfillment and loyalty, and they are, even if they escaped from the gathering between them To be the rhythm of the rudeness, it is followed by what it walked.The third: the housing of the fasted rudeness and the leaving what was accepted by what was said: Yes, and the misery of the first conquest, and the second as it is said: so that it is said.The fourth: that the hall of the hall of the hall of the hallway and its fracture is transferred to what he accepted, and it is said: Yes, by breaking the noun, and the eyes of the eye, as it is said: He knew that this is the last change, even if it is in the limit of the permissibility when the launch of these two words, except that they made it obligatory for them to their goodness, the one who has been lost.The news is about the existence of the source in the past time and their passion is the word of praise and vilification and is intended for the exaggeration in the praise and the vilification, so that this is the reason for the abundance The change from the origin in the meaning, and they say: The blessings of the man are no more, and they do not remember it at the original in the first place in the harm of the poetry, as he sought the righteous: People are from evil and harm, as long as they are minor, that they are the best of those who are in the next matter.The time that is the mark of inheritance in them, and it is said: I was blessed and miserable, and the freedom makes them with the domesticity of the names and it is made with the saying of the good النال We have the blessings of the neighbor, the house of his house is composed of people with a lot of money, and what was narrated that an Arab was preached by the milestone, so he said: Your loyalty, and he said: By God, what is the blessings of the Mawlida and the Basris, they answer it by that by the way of the story.The third question: Know that “yes and the misery” of the original for the righteousness and the wasting, and it is their actor as a name that is used by the gender, either The first: the one who says your saying, the blessing of the man is more, you do not want a man without a man, but rather the man intends to release.And the second: We say the blessings of the man of the man is more more.As for his saying: ؎ The knees, Uthaman ibn Afnah, and it was said: It was for the sake of his saying: And the blame, as if he had brought him in the people, and the host, then he said: Yes, a good man.It is indicated by him and a man who sets on the way, the same in your saying: Twenty men and the distinguished are not only a denial, do not you see that no one does not say, the tenth of the day.Enter the thousand and the blame on this, and they said: The man was blessed with the setting, it would have been contradicted for the sake of the sake, when they would want to come with the mouth, and they said: They stopped themselves with the support of the guarantee, but they ran the actor with a intention to the broken, as it was “yes as a man” indicating the sex that was preferred to him.(P-167) The following question: If you say the blessing of the man is more, then he is on two sides: one of them: that it is a beginner, as if he said: And the intention is that it is the possibility, as it says: I passed the poor, you want: the poor passed through it, but the one who returns to the beginning is the one who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who is a man who was a man who was a man who is a man who was a man who was a man In it, the spectrum was more than inside it, and it became a masculinity of the remembrance that returns to it.And the other man: that it is more Zuid in your saying: the blessing of the man is a more noble news, as if it was said: the blessing of the man, who said: It was said: Zure, that is, it is more.The fifth question: the one who is pronounced in the praise and the slander is only from the speeches of the masculine after the blessings and the misery of the increase in the men, and if it was the same, the added is to the one.He worsened like the people who lied to our verses [Al -A'raf: 177] deleted, and its estimation is a misfortune, like the people who have lied to our verses, and for our signs, and for our signs, and for our signs.We return to the interpretation.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: in Basma, they bought it for themselves to disbelieve in two issues: the first question: The misery of the thing is something that they bought themselves, and the one who is devoted to the omission, “to atone.” المَسْألَةُ الثّانِيَةُ: في الشِّراءِ هَهُنا قَوْلانِ: أحَدُهُما: أنَّهُ بِمَعْنى البَيْعِ, وبَيانُهُ أنَّهُ تَعالى لَمّا مَكَّنَ المُكَلَّفَ مِنَ الإيمانِ الَّذِي يُفْضِي بِهِ إلى الجَنَّةِ والكُفْرِ الَّذِي يُؤَدِّي بِهِ To the fire, his choice has become for one of them on the other in the hose of the choice that possesses a boil over a premium, so if the faith in which he has been seen in it.It was said: Yes, what I have participated, and when the exhibition was sold and the purchase is the indication of a king who possesses a reconciliation to describe each one of them that it is a good and the one who is bound by this It is correct to follow his words: He himself, that what is meant by themselves with their disbelief is because those who crossed it on the benefits of themselves when he was the disbeliever, they became a good one.The second face: It is the most correct for me that the cost of the cost if he is afraid of himself from the punishment of God, he comes with tags that he thinks that it will be saved from the punishment, so it is like that Business, so that the Jews are when they believed that they came to him that they saved them from the punishment, and they will reach them to the reward.Sometimes they bought them yourself, and this face is close to the meaning and the memorization from the first, then it is the Almighty, explaining the interpretation of what they bought with it, Since God descended and there is no suspicion that what is meant by this is their disbelief in the Qur’an, because the speech is in the Juda and they were believers in others, and then the one who has been clear.Since God revealed, he said: He was absent and referred to them to their abuse of disbelief, as it is said that it is returned so, so if there is no envy; Alert him to that on his abuse, and if only this saying, we would have permitted us to disbelieve ignorance, not unpleasant.Know that this verse indicates that the envy is forbidden.And when the prostitute, it was for a variety of wives, among the Almighty, who were satisfied with this prostitute by saying: that God will be revealed from his grace to whom he does not What we taught that they thought that this great grace of the expected prophets will get in their people, so when they found it in the Arabs, they carry them.As for the saying of the Exalted: They are angry with anger, and it has books: * * * * (P-168) The first question: In the interpretation of the angry, it is one of them: no one: For the anger: one of them: what was presented while they were lying to them, peace be upon him, and what was revealed to him and the other Entering anger after anger and wrapping after he was planned by the highness; For the sake of that they entered into a reason after the reason, which is the saying of goodness, the people, Ikrama, and my father, the high and miserable.The second: It is not intended to prove two angry, so that it is only intended to prove the types of anger, an overflow for the sake of the arbitrary things that were issued by them, the one who said: God [Repentance: 30].The hand of God is a seduction [Al -Ma’idah: 64].God is a poor and the riches of the people [Al -Imran: 181], and this is not among the types of their disbelief, and it is the saying of Ata and Ubayd ibn Amir.The third: that what is intended for it is the affirmation of the anger and its multiplication; It is for the sake of this disbelief, even if it is one, but it is great, and it is the saying of my father Muslim.The Funny: The first with their servants, the second, and the second, with their assignment, is the characteristic of Muhammad, and their norms of his prophets from the sixth.The second question: the anger is a expressions of the change that He offers a person in his mood at a golitan of his heart with the causes of the scenes of a custodian, and that is referred to the right of God, so he is the one who is forbidden, so it is the one who is the one who is forbidden to the Almighty The curse and the matter of that.The third question: that he is correct and described as anger and that his anger is increasing and multiplying, and he is valid in it as his health in the torment, so he does not have anger, so he is not angry, so he is not angry, so he is not angry, so he is not angry, so he is not angry With a single summary, as he was angry at those who disbelieve in many connections.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: For the disbelievers, there is a humiliating torment, and it has books: the first question: His saying: For the disbelievers, there is a humiliating torment that has a goodness, and it is a good.It is insulting that the first phrase enters these infidels and others, and the second phrase does not enter into it except for them.The second question: The torment in the truth is not the professional because the meaning of that is that he insulted otherwise With the many torment, but insulting when it was obtained with the torment, it is permissible to make that from his description, because it was said: the torment is only with insulting, so what is the good?We said: The one of the torment is counted by insulting, in which there is a sign of evidence, for God Almighty mentioned that to be an indication of it.The third question: A people said: His exalted say: The disbelievers have a humiliating torment that indicates that there is no torment except for the disbelievers, and then after this In this verse, two are two: one of them: the Kharijites said: I have been proven by the captives of the verses that the evildoer is tormented, and this verse has proven that it is not tortured except for the sake kafir.And the second: the recipient said: This verse is proven that it is not tormented except the infidel and stated that the evildoer is not a disbeliever, so it is necessary for the cutting that it is not torture The two sayings are not hidden.
