The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: Not that the book of the jaws is in a prisons, and I do not realize what is a prisoner as a book that is skeptical and the night of the one who lies with those who lie to those who deny it Except every ethnic, if our verses are recited to him, the myths of the first said to them, but they have been on their hearts.For the salutation of the hell, then it is said that this is what you were lying and know that it was their pursuit of what he showed, this sin, follow him with the remembrance Its said: (All) and those who were mentioned in it.The first: It is a deterrent and alerts it, that is, the matter is not on what they are in terms of sins and neglect, from the remembrance of the resurrection and the account, so let them be called, and the words of the words are: It is a result of which it communicates after it in the sense of it, if the book of the juice is in a prison, and it is the saying of goodness.The second type: It is the same and described the book of the jewelry with the loss and the contempt on the path of the heat, and here we are asking.The first question: The prisoners are the name of a flag of a certain thing or a name that is derived from the meaning?We said in it: The first: It is the saying of the philosophers of the interpreters: that it is the name of a knowledge of something in a clear thing, then they differed in it, so they are more than the one who is on the authority Ibn Abbas said in the narration of Ata, Qutdah, Mujahid, and Al -Dhagak and Ibn Zaid, and Al -Barah narrated that peace be upon him, he said: “ And in it, in it, and his atoms, and Abu Hurairah narrated that he was peace be upon him, he said: ““ A prisons are a forehead in hell.”The dog and Mujahid said: The second saying: It is a derivative and named prisons from the priest, and it is the love and the adaptation as it is said: a slave from the immorality, and it is the saying of Abu Ubayd and al -Zujaj.The one: This is weak and the evidence is that a prisons are not what the Arabs were known to say: What do you think of what is prisons, that is, it is not what you know.I do not say this is weak, so perhaps it is that it is a greatness for the matter of prisons, as in his saying: What is the most aware of the day of religion, the owner of the “scout” said: It is taken from the prison, and then it is a name that is transmitted from a description of signs, and it is a disposive, because it is only one of the causes, and it is the endowment, if this is the same.We mentioned that God Almighty made matters with his worshipers on what they disagree with from dealing with them between them and their greatness.Paradise is a wool with high, shiny, wiping, and the presence of the angels, and the prisons are described by locksmith, darkness, distress, and the presence of the people (P-85) The two people, and there is no doubt that the highness, the strain, the wipe and the presence of the angels The approaches, all of that of the attributes of the fullness and pride, and its addition of the characteristics of the deficiency and humiliation, so when I want and describe the infidelity and their writers with humiliation, the despondency is that The position of regret, the darkness, the distress, and the presence of the demons, and when it described the book of the righteous with pride, it was said: It is on the authority of the two.And the closest witnessed [Al -Mutaffifin: 17].The second question: God has told the book of the jaws that he was in a prison and then made a prisoner with a Book of Markqum, as if it was said: If their book is in a book in a book?Al -Qafal replied: He said: It is a sophisticated book that is not an interpretation of a prisoner, but the estimation: Not that the writers of the jewel are in a prison, and if it is a book, and if the book is a book, the book is the book So this is a description to write the jewel with two descriptions.One of them: It is in a prison.The second: It is a sophisticated, and its saying was signed: I do not realize what is imprisoned between the two descriptions, and God knows.And the first thing is that it is said: What is the repetition in the whereabouts of one of the two writers in the other, either by the book of the jewelry in the book that is the most prominent origin to it in the separation of the What is in the book of the jewelry to that book called the Singer, and it has a third aspect: that is what is meant by the book, the book, so it will be in the meaning: the book of the vagina in the authority of the jaws, i.E.Their work in a prison, then the prisons were described as a brilliant book in which all the works of the jewelry.The third question: What is the meaning of its saying: a brilliant book?We said in it: one of them: one of them: a boundary, that is, a biblical whose work is in it.And the second: Qatada said: They were sought to worse, that is, they were written for the positive fire.And the third of it: Al -Qafal said: It is necessary for what is intended to have made that book a sophisticated, as the merchant is numbered by its mark for its values, so it is like that Raqqum with steroids indicating his throats.And its booster: Al -Muqrum: Hahna al -Mukhmum, the one said: It is correct because the seal is a mark, so it is permissible for the sophisticated to be called a seal.Fifth: The meaning is a book that is proven to them, such as sterility in the garment that does not praise, but its saying: and the day of the day of the lies, so that it is.One of them: He is connected to his saying: the day of people will rise, that is: the day of people will rise to the Lord of the two worlds, and to those who lied to the people of God.And the second: that his saying: (sterile) with sophistication with a sterility that indicates the righteousness on the Day of Resurrection, then he said: And the day of the day is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the right It is the highest that is informed of the adjective of those who lie to the Day of Religion, and he said: What is denying that only every ethnic usual, if our verses are recited to him, the myths of the first person said that he is not the one who is the first of the two.Except for those who were described by these three attributes.So the first: its color is aggressive, and the appetite is the risen from the right approach.And the second: the sinner It is exaggerated in the adoption of sin and sins.And I say that the human being has two strengths of the theoretical force, and its hope is to know the truth to itself, and the practical force and its hope that it knows the good for the sake of the one who is the first God is exalted, with what is not permissible and described it, for everyone who is forbidden from the possibility of resurrection and resurrection is that it is prohibited either because he did not know the knowledge of God from the knowledge And parties, or because he did not know the ability of God to all the possibilities.This is the opposite against the operational power, is the preoccupation with lust, anger, and its owner is the rich, and that is because the abuser of the lust and the anger of the life of the one And obedience, and perhaps that has become forbidden by faith in resurrection.As for the third adjective: for those who lie to the Day of Religion, it is his saying: If our verses are recited to him, the myths of the first and those who are intended for those who are denied, then the one who denies the Prophet, The Qur’an, the myths of the first said, in which one of them is: the lies of the first P-86.The second: the first news of the first and that it was taken from any of the Qur’an from the Qur’an from God with this way, and here is another search: that this is the one who is the one of the rituals of the three.A certain person or not?It is a saying.The first: It is the saying of the dog: that the one who is intended from the ibn al -Mughira, and others said: It is the one who is the son of al -Harith, and he who said: He is the one who said: A lavish spectacle to his saying: a sinful, accustomed to his saying: If our verses are recited to him, the myths of the first said [pen: 15] and it was said: He is the son of the son of the deceased Meaning: And what is denying the Day of Religion from the Quraysh or from your people except for every sinful aggressor, and this is the appointed person.And the second saying: It is general in the right of all those who seek these attributes, but the words of the Almighty: “No, but they have been on their hearts, they would not have been.He tells him that these are the myths of the first, but their past actions have become a reason for the arrival of the two in their hearts, and for the people of the language in the interpretation of the word, For the people of interpretation, it is other faces.The dead will go with it, the lean said: The sleepiness and the wine in the head if it is established in it, while it is evident in Rayn and al -Rayoun, and from this the hadith of Omar in Ashfah “The father of Zayd said:“ Abu Zaid said: It is said: Rin with a man, and he will see him as a slope if he signs, while he is not able to come out of it.Abu Muazah Al -Nahwi said: The two people are to support the heart than sins and pride to be printed on the heart, which is more severe than the two, and the locking More than the print, which is to close the heart, Al -Zajaj said: Rann over their hearts in the sense of covering their hearts, it is said: Ran over the heart of his heart.And the appearance is like a honesty, the heart and the same are the eye, but the people of interpretation, so they are guided by: Al -Hasan said and Mujahid: It is the sin on the sins, until the sins, so that the sins are not.And he deceived him, and the heart dies, and it was narrated from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: ““ I will be rewarded with sins.The heart of the heart is like the palm, so if the sin is sought, he will be held, and if he is a sin, another sin, then he will be held, then he is printed on him while he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the right His heart is a ritual ritual until the heart of all of the heart, and it was narrated in the hadith of Abu Hurairah, I said: I do not doubt that the verbs are disturbed An enforcement, for whoever wants to learn the writing, the more he would have the work of the writing more, the more it is his restriction on the work of the book, so that he would come to me, until he becomes a matter With the writing, without narration, or a thought, this is the Nafiqiya form, when it was generated from these many works, each of which has one of those with those of those in the same.If you know this, then this is a person who says: If a person is based on the two types of sins, you will get in his heart, a king of an enforcement, and no one, and no one, and the king of the authority of the authority, The meaning of the sinner, unless it occupies you without God, and everything that occupies you without God is injustice, for all sins are injustice and darkness, and for all Its group is the same as the kingdom of its effect, so that is what is meant by their saying: The more the human being, the human being, is the same as the ritual of the ritual The paths of the communications were in the severity and weakness, and there was no crime.The judge is not intended from the two righteousness that their heart has changed and he was forbidden in it, but what is meant is that they have become the rhythm of sins after a state of the tranquility of it, and it is a disgrace to it.Leave the repentance and leave the licking, so they darkened and made the matter to them, and for that indicated that the cause of the argument is that they would be caused, and it is known that their proliferation is from the one who is from the one who does not gain from the right Creating and repentance, and I say that we have indicated that the act of the verb if the invitation (P-87) is to the verb, and the call to the leaving is referred to the abuse of the risk of the murderer, so that the municipality of the place is so that it is possible.It is a matter of the state of the righteous, and when the judge delivered that they became the caused by the righteous verbs, so it is obligatory to take place in this case.It has been presented in this book.As for his words, the Almighty is that they are from their Lord, then they are the arguments, so do not know that they mentioned in (all) and faces: one of them: the owner of the “scout” said: The pioneer of their hearts.And the second: Al -Qafal said: God Almighty said in the path of the light from this sinful aggressor that he was saying if the hereafter was truly a truly, for God is the highest, and he will give him money He lied to him in this article, and he said: The absence of the mother was taken from the mercy of the Rahman [Maryam: 78] [Chapter: 50] And when this was from what his remembrance was repeated in the Qur’an, God blessed him, and he said: “No, they are from their Lord, and then, for the sake In the last, they are good, but they are from their Lord, then for those who are guided.And the second: that this is a confusion and be “all of this” is the remembrance in his saying: No, but rather, but he said: They are from their Lord, the day of the day.The companions needed that the believers saw him, they said: If not for that, there was no more disclargement.And there is another report, which is that it is the highest of this veil in the disposal and the supply of atonement, and what is a feast and a threat to the atonement is not permissible in the right of the right, and it is not permissible.So this veil does not get the right to the believer, the dismissed answered this from his face They are varied, as it is said in the exhibitors: the brother is veiled the mother on the third, and from that it is said: for those who prevent the income he is a need, because he is forbidden.And the second: Abu Muslim said: For those who are close to those who are close, and the response is the response, and it is against the acceptance, and the meaning is the denial of the mission, and it is not the same From his words, the Almighty: God does not speak to them and does not look at them on the Day of Resurrection and does not pay them (Al -Imran: - 77].And the third of it: The judge said: The hijab is not a light from the vision of the vision, for it may be said: so that so, so that so, so that he had seen it from the distance, and if it is not a distance, and if he did not The vision has fallen, but it must be carried on its goods, which are varied from the emotions of its mercy.And its booster: The owner of the “scouts” said: They are the arguments of it as a representative of the heroic of their dehydration with them and their humiliation, because it is not permissible for the one who is not for those who are not.Only the humiliations of them are veiled.And the answer: There is no doubt that those who are forbidden to see something that is said: He is a veil about him, and also who is forbidden from entering on the commander, it is said: He is a veil of it, and it is forbidden for him The third in the cause of the brother Paying the memorial in a concept is a blessed between these positions, a motivation for your destruction in the memorial, and that is the prohibition.In the first image, the prevention of the vision was obtained, and in the second, the prohibition from the arrival obtained its proximity, and in the third: the prohibition from the investigator of the triumphant, then the one who is the one, Not for their Lord, then to those who are varied, and the prohibition is achieved by the lineage to what the servant proves with the proportions, and the Lord is the same It can be carried on science, because it is steadfast with the agreement to atonement, so it is obligatory (P-88) to carry it on the vision.As for his behavior to the mercy, it is an enemy from the back of the other, and so what the owner of the “scout” said: He left for the back of the other, then what is the one who is not.The evidence is the sayings of the interpreters.A fighter said: The meaning of the verse is that they are after the offer and the calculation, they do not see their Lord, and the believers see their Lord, and the dog said: He says that they are from the view of the Lord, to the Lord of the Lord, And the believer does not veil from seeing his Lord, and Malik Bin Anas was asked about this verse, so he said: When his enemies did not see him, he did not see him, and he has no need He sees him, and on the authority of Al -Shafi’i when he gave a sin in the weapon, he indicated that a people see him with the satisfaction, but the saying of the Almighty: then they are the sake In the arrival of the resurrection, either from the vision of God on our saying, or on the mercy of God and his honor on the saying of the disgraced And they were spoiled by their lies with the resurrection and the penalty, so he was told: This is what you were lied to in the world, and now you have been appointed to him.
