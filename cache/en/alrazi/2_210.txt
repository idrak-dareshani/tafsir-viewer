The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: Do they see that God will bring them in a shadow of dignity and angels, and the matter is spent, and to God, the things are returned, knowing that in the verse: Al -Misassi in the memory of the view is mentioned in the interpretation of his words, the Almighty: The faces of the day are raised to its Lord, the view [Qiyama: 22] and they gathered upon me Waiting, God Almighty said: So the view of what the messengers return [Al -Nimel: 35], so what is meant by his saying is the Almighty: Do they look at the waiting.* * * Everything that comes to the one who comes and the goat is not separated from the movement (P-181) and the silence, and they are updated, and what is not dismissed from the modern is that it is an event, so it is a matter The one who comes and the vulva must be a created modern, and the Almighty God will be prejudiced to be like that.And the second: that everything that is correct for the resignation is from place to place, either to be in the younger and despicable as the part that is not fragmented, and that is void, and that is false, Likewise, but it will be a great thing, so it is one of its sides as a definition for the other Permanent in achieving it to achieve every one of its parts, and each of its parts other than it, so every compound is a lack of it, and all of it is not.It is possible for itself, and all possible for itself, it is needed in its existence to the most likely and the found, for all that was like that, it is an event that is created, and the one is the one who is the one It is forbidden to be like that.And the third of it: that everything that is correct for the resignation from one place to a place is limited and dead, and it is a disagreement with a certainty, with the fact that he was in the mind that he was in the mind.A fate that is more than it or decreases, so that it will be made with that appointed destiny, and it must be likely to be likely to be likely, and the specialization of specialization, and all that was like that was like that Faten, and everything that was like that is an updated modern, for God is the eternal valid, it is forbidden to be like that.And its elevation: when we have been blessed in the thing that is correct for the coming and the vulnerable to be an eternal, eternal God, so that we cannot be able The sun and the moon, and some of the smartests of our companions said: The sun and the moon are not disadvantaged in them, which is forbidden from the saying of their divinity, so that they are the same.He who has passed the coming and the vulnerability to God, may God bless you, who will not judge the deity of the sun, and what is required of him to judge with the abandonment of another He is a god.Fifth: that God Almighty narrated from the caliphate, peace and blessings be upon him, that he stabbed in the divine of the makers, the moon, and the sun with his saying: I do not love the people: [76] The absence and the presence, whoever has the goodness of the absence and the presence of God Almighty, he was stabbed in the evidence of the Khalil, peace be upon him, and God lied in the truth of the Almighty.Sixth: that Pharaoh is the curse of God, upon him, when he asked Moses, peace be upon him, and he said: What is the Lord of the two worlds [Al -Shua’ar: 23], and he asked him for the goodness, A body described by forms and quantities, the answer to this question is only by the remembrance of the image, the form, and the destiny: the answer of the peace be upon him: [Al -Shua’ar: 24] Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the first of the two sins [smoke: 8] The answer, and the pursuit of Pharaoh in his saying: Your Messenger, who was sent to you to the madness [Al -Sha'arar: 27], and when all of that is false, he is a false It is a body, and that it is in a place, and it is permissible for it to be valid for the coming and the dull.And the one who followed it: He is the Almighty, he said: Say: God is one of the brothers: 1] And one is the whole in the Haddiyyah, and every body is divided by the basis of the wise and the sign of the reward, so it was the reward of the It is a body or a bias, so when it was not a body or a bias, the coming and the dullness are forbidden, and also the Almighty said: Do you know that it is a name.And if it was a biased body, it would be similar to the bodies in the body, but the difference will get behind the body, and that is either by the greatness or the righteous He praises the similarities in the self, and also said to the highest, as it is like something [Al -Shura: 11] and if it was a body, he would be an example for the bodies.(P-182) and eighth: If he was a biased body, he would not be a richness of the bodies of the bodies in the general body of body The special is, or it is not, if it is the first, with what is the polytheism, it is not what it is permissible, so it is generally a body that is a body of the same, and this is the same.If we describe those devoted to the concepts of his body, we had made the body a liquid The special is a majestic for the understanding of his body as a body and other things in his form, as a body, so that the same is the same The body and other things are woven with it, and that denies the exaggeration After that it was a body that does not contradict the bodies of the bodies in a special, then it is a proverb for it as a divorce, and everything that is correct for it is that it is true that it is true, then it is true that it is true.It is a case that must be like that, and every referral, so you have proven that it is not in a body, nor with a bodies, and that it is not correct.* * * If you know this, then say: The people of the words are different in his saying: Do they only look for God and God will come to them and remember in it the faces: The righteous is that when it was established with the seized signs that the coming and the dahd of God is a referred to God After that, another thing, for if we want to do so, we did not believe in the mistake, so the first silence is from the interpretation, and the crowning of the meaning of the verse is upon the meaning What was reported by Ibn Abbas was that he said: The Qur’an has been revealed to four faces: a face that is not known by one of his ignorance, and the face of his knowledge.And we know it from the Arabism only, and a face that only God knows.This saying may be excluded from the saying in it in the interpretation of his saying: The pain.The third face: It is the saying of the speaking of the two speakers: that it is necessary to be interpreted from the way of separation, then they mentioned in it, and the first: the first: the first: the first: the first: God comes to them, i.E.The verses of God, so he made the coming of the verses to come to him on the disturbance of the signs The validity of this is the one that he said in the advanced verse.And threatening, then it is a consequence that affirmed that by saying: Do they only look for God and knowing that the ability is to be valid for the coming of God, for the one who is the one who is the one who will come to God.Because of the hardship and the imprisonment, because it is with the presence as the disbelievers are imprisoned and punished.It will be a reason for the supplies and the support, so when the intended is from the verse, it is the return and the supply, and it must be added in the verse, the coming of the hippo, the abundance, and the exaltation, The suspicion is in the college, and this is a good and agreed one.And the second face in the interpretation: that what is meant is that they see that God comes to them, that is, the command of God, and the path of words in this section is that it is up to him, and then he is a remembrance of it, then it is a remembrance of it, then it is to mention it.It is referred, the duty is to be paid to interpret They are fighting his guardians, and he said: And ask the village [Yusuf: 82] and what is meant: and ask the people of the village, so he said: God will come to them, and God will come to them.Your Lord [Al-Fajr: 22] The WhatsApp: The command of your Lord came, and there is only the addition of the added, and the residence of the added to it is his place, which is (p-183) a mockery of a famous, and it is said: What is meant is that he commanded that, not that he took that work with itself, and then the saying confirms the health And his saying: Your Lord came to tell about the state of resurrection, and then he mentioned this occurrence with its eyes in the surah of the beekeeper, and he said: Do they look at them except that you will come [Bee: 33] So this judgment became an interpretation of that similar; Because all of these verses are when they were returned in a single satellite that did not exceed the holding of each other.And the second: that he said after him: The matter was spent, and there is no doubt that the thousand and the imams of the preceding grace, so it is imperative that it is that the remembrance of the matter before that is the same.And the blame is a reference to it, and that is nothing but the one that we have guided that his saying: God brings them to them, that is, the command of God will come to them.If it is said: The command of God has a valuable adjective, so the two of it is referred to it, and when the one who is disgraced is that there are voices, so they are symptoms, so they are also referred to it.We said: The matter in the language has two meaning: one of them is the verb, the affairs and the sticker.[Hood: 97] In the proverb: For a matter of his nose, it is a matter of blackness who blacks down, so the matter is carried on the verb, which is what is met by the domain of the people The indicated, and this is the first interpretation that we mentioned, and as for our pregnancy on the matter that is against the forbidden, it is in his face and Jahan: one of them: that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one that is Resurrection: Except that God commands you with such and such, and that is the matter of the matter, and its saying: in shadow of the dignity, that is, with shadow, and the ability: that the hearing of that call and that is the same One.The second: that the one who is intended from the command of God be in the shadow of the dignity, the voices of the voices are specially sealed in those dignity, which indicate the ruling of God, the Almighty, from the righteousness of God.Happiness and slander, or it is intended to be the creation of an organized neck in the shadow of the dignity of the severity And the return and others, and the excessive shadow is from the dignity that he has made him a matter of what he wants to bring him down with people, so he knew that the matter is that.The third direction in the interpretation is that the meaning: Do they only look for God to come to them with what he is of torment and reckoning, so he deleted what he brings to him, and if he had to be mentioned, if he mentioned what he came to him, then he would come to him It was mentioned that it was the most vulnerable to the division of their phases, and their thoughts are in every face, and the same is the Almighty saying: So God brought them from where they did not Topical shakes their homes with their hands and the hands of the believers [Al -Hasharah: 2] The meaning is that God brought them to their ancestral to them from where they did not say: They are from the signs, so the stood from them is from their age and the torment came to them [the bee: 26], so he said it: The torment came to them [the bee: 26] So God came with their sons from the barriers [the bee: 26] and it is said in the back of the back if he is heard with a fierce state: We have come to us so and his injustice, and there is no doubt.The one who is the loyal face in the interpretation: to be “in” in the sense of the B, and the forefathers of the neighbor, some are the place of some, and its estimation is that they see that they are not And the angels, and the intended torment that he brings in the dignity with the angels.(P-184) Fifth face: that the intended from the verse is the way of the bone of the day of resurrection and its inception and its intensity, and that is because all the guys are if they are attended And the privilege, and the judge was in that specialty, the greatest of the sultans, and the greatest of them is a hibernation, so the people of the guys are not the same time So the supplies of the remembrance of God will be the pace of the end of the hippo and the end of the fear, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: and what God has destroyed the right of his destiny, The resurrection [Al -Zamer: 67], without the construction of a tunnel, and the right, but it is a visibility of the greatness of it to represent the hidden in the righteous, so, so, so.The sixth face: It is clear to me from all that he prevailed: We mentioned that his saying is up to the Almighty: O you who believe, enter in the peace of all The estimation is his saying: If you are removed after what the evidence came to you, know that God is dear wise, be a speech with the Jews, and then he said: They only look at them that God brings them in a shadow of dignity and angels as a story about Jews, and the meaning: that they do not accept your religion except that God will come to them in the shadow of the So, with Moses, like that, they said: We will not believe for you until we see God as a phenomenon [Al -Baqarah: 55] and if this is a story about the state of Jews, and it is not a good Because the Jews were on the flame of the likeness, and they were permissible for God who came and the dull, and they were saying: It is the Almighty May the peace be upon him in the shadow of the dignity, and they demanded the same as that in the time of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and on this appreciation, this will be this.The Jews who say about the suspicion, then do not need to be taken into account, nor to the sake of memorization on the metaphor, and in the course, the verse indicates that the people are waiting for them, There is no significance in the verse that they are right in that waiting or overwhelmed, and on this estimation, the forms will be brought up.If it was said: This is on the authority of how he is attached to it, the Almighty saying: To God, things are returned.We said: The face is in it that it is upset when he told their stubbornness and stopped them in the acceptance of religion on this corrupt condition, so he reminded after what he said: Monster, and this face appears with me from everything that preceded, and God knows the truth of his words.The one who followed the following: What the lock has told in his “interpretation” on the authority of my father, the highness, which is that the two in the shadow is added to the angels; As for the addition of God, it is the same, then it was the same, so the carrying of the words was on the forefront and delay, and he will be martyred in his health with the readers of the one who has been.God and the angels come to them in the shadow of the dignity, “The cloth, may God have mercy on him, said: This is the most disguised.* * * As for his saying: In the shadow of the dignity, I know that “the shadow” is a shadow, and it is what God has shaded with it, and the gambling is “so that it is only if it is a gathering A phrase for a separate cut, every piece of which is in the end of the density and the greatness, for every piece of shadow, and the gathering is shadow, he said: And if they are omitted: 32] And some of them read: “Unless God brings them in the shadows of dignity,“ So the shadow is required that the shadow be a shadow, as a shadow and a few, and that the collection of shadow will be.(P-185) If you know this, then say: The meaning is what they see, except that the abundance of God and his torment will come to them in shadow of the dignity.If it was said: And why did the torment come to them in the gamble?We said: Lujoh: One of it: that the dignity is the thought of the mercy, so if the torment comes from it, the matter is more sober, because evil, if it comes from where it does not take place, then it is the one who came to the Where it is not counted, it was more influential in the secret, so how if the evil comes from where the good is seen, and from this he is accustomed to the one who is in the mind of the people of God From God, they did not be seen [Al -Zamer: 47].And the second: that the descent of the cloud is a mark for the appearance of what is the most severe of the horrors in the resurrection.For the merciful, and it was a day on the disbelievers as a difficult [Al -Faraqan: 25, 26].And the third: that The dignity of which there are many diameters, unjustly, not limited.As for the saying of the Almighty: the angels are a kindness of what preceded it, and the appreciation: the angels bring them, and the angels can be brought to them It has become the meaning that the command of God and his signs and the angels come with that they come to come to what they commanded from insulting or tormented or other than the rulings.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: The matter was spent in it, the first question: It is beneficial to pay what a trick.The second question: Its saying: The matter is spent with it: the matter is spent, and the estimation is: except that God will come to them and make up the matter, and the past is placed, and the past is placed.In the Qur’an, and it is special in the matters of the hereafter, then the news about it falls many in the past.116] The reason for the choice of this metaphor is two things: one of them: the alert on the proximity of the last matter of the last, as if the hour has come and the fall of what God wants to rhythm.The second: the exaggeration is in certainty that it is necessary to fall into the seizure of every soul with what is sought, so it became the crop and the severity of the part of it.The third question: the reminded matter is the separation of the judiciary between the successors, and the facts are taken to its lords and the removal of every one of the costs of the jungle, and it is the same.And the Satan said when the matter was spent that God and your promise and the promise of the truth [Ibrahim: 22].If you know this, then we say: Its saying: The matter is evident that the conditions of resurrection are found in a payment from otherwise standing, for it is not the Almighty, and it is not for you, and it is not for you.Manniah.The following question: Reading Mu'tah ibn Jabal “and spending the matter” on the mark, kindness to the angels.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: To God, the things return to it, and they have the books: the first question: from the embodiment of the one who said: the word "to the end of the end, and that is the end of the The exalted in a place that ends up with the day of resurrection, the people of Al-Tawihid answered him from two vicinity: The first: that he is the Almighty owned his servants in the world, many (p-186) The hereafter, there is no money for the ruling in worshipers, as he said: And the matter is the day for God [Al -Nafr: 19], and this is like their saying: He returned to the command, if he is the command of the command, then he is the command of the commander, if he is the command of the commander.And his counterpart is the Almighty saying: To God, the fate [Al -Nur: 42] with the fact that the creation is in his kingdom and his authority.The second: Abu Muslim said: It is the high Constitution and the balby are of all things, so if this house is passed and we prayed to the house of reward and punishment, the whole thing was for God and alone, and if it is like that, then it is the family of it Peace is as it is commanded, and he is excluded from the steps of Satan as it is forbidden.The second question: Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr and Asim read, “Return” by adding the Tae to the meaning of reversal, it is said: I returned it, that is, I repeated it, and he said: [I was separated: 50] and in another position: and if I was returned to my Lord [Al -Kahf: 36] and in another position: then they were returned to God, the right of the truth: [62] Perhaps I am righteous [the believers: 99], that is, he responded, and read the son of Amir, Hamza, and Al -Kisaei “Return” by opening the time, that is, it will be made, like the one who said: The things [Al -Shura: 53] and his saying: We have their return [Al -Ghaffiya: 25] to God Al -Qafil, may God have mercy on him, said: The meaning in the two readings is closely He said: And in his saying: The things are returned to the sake of the Taa three with three pursues: one of them: this is the one who mentioned it, which is that it is the shame of its majesty, and it is returned as he said in this thing.The second: He is on the gold of the Arabs in their saying: So that he likes his soul, and the man says to others: to where he goes with you, and if he does not go to you.The third: that the self of creation and their attributes, when they were witnessed to them that they are the ones who are holding accountable, and they were their command to their uncle, and they are the one who said: Matters, that is, worshipers return to him and to his ruling with the testimony of themselves, and he is as he said: He praises to God what is in the heavens and what is in the earth [the gathering: 1], then this is this.With the according to the height of the tongue, and on it he also carries his saying: And to God, whoever prostrates in the heavens and the earth is a voluntary and a ritual [Al -Ra’dah: 15].Pain, and the disbelievers will be prostrated to him with a testimony of themselves that they are the servants of God, so it is permissible to say: The worshipers will return to the affairs of God To him, the believers are in the article, and the infidels are the testimony of the situation.
