The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: O you who believe, enter all the peace and do not follow the steps of the Satan, it is an enemy that is clear that he knows that he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who knows that it is the Almighty.He seeks in the land to spoil in it and destroy the plow and the hypocrisy, the Muslims commanded what is against that, which is the attribute of Islam and in its parts, and he said: O Oy The peace is all in which there are issues: the first question: the reader of a many and the benefits, and the “peace” of the conquest of the Sunnah, and so in his saying: “And they are the one who is grateful.” [61] And his saying: And call for peace [Muhammad: 35] and read in the narration of Abi Bakr bin Ayyash “Peace” by breaking the Sunnah in all, and read the Hamza and the sake of this And what is in the cow, which is in Surah Muhammad in his saying: “And call for peace.Surah Muhammad, so they went out that they were two linguists with openness and fracture, like: rugs, rugs, bridges and bridges, (p-176) and read the hearts.The second question: the origin of this word is from the purity, God Almighty said: His Lord said to him, Islam said: “The cow: 131] and Islam, but the name of God The name of peace be upon the reconciliation and the killing of war, and this is also a return to this meaning; Because when the righteousness is led by every one for its owner and does not dispute it in it, Abu Ubaidah said: There are three languages ​​in it: peace, peace, and peace.The third question: in the verse is a problem, which is that many of the interpreters are the peace of peace on Islam, so the estimation of the verse becomes: O you who believe in Islam Islam, and it is known that this is not permissible, and for this question, the interpreters are mentioned in the interpretation of this verse: one of them: that the person is intended, the one who is intended, And the appreciation: O you who believe in their tongues, enter your entirety in Islam, and do not follow the steps of the Satan, that is, the effects of his decay, and the rituals, He said in this interpretation, he brought his health that this verse was reversed, but the Aqeeb was returned to what he went from the remembrance of the hypocrites, and it is his saying: and from the one who is a person.When the hypocrite described what he mentioned, he called in this verse to faith in the heart and left the hypocrisy.And the second: that this verse was descended in a sect of the Muslim people of the book, such as the servant of God, Bin Salam, and his companions, and that is because they believed in the peace of God.Moses osteoporosis, so they grew up the Sabbath, and they hated the domains of the camels and their milk, and they said: These things are left are permissible in Islam, and a duty in the ritual Until, God has thought of this and commanded them and commanded them They enter all of the peace, that is, in all Islam, and do not hold anything from the rulings of the delegate, in order to be able to do it and do it; Because it became a fabrication and do not follow the steps of the Satan in the assignment of the rulings of the mandate, after that you know that it became a human being, and those who say that they said: All of the description of peace, as if it was said: Enter all the bones of Islam, and to do and work.And the third of it: that this speech is a sense of the people of the book that they did not believe in the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said: Oh, those who believe in the book Peace be upon you, that is, the whole of your obedience in faith, and that is to believe in all his prophets and his books, so enter your faith in praise be upon him and the peace of peace, and not in the peace of peace Follow the steps of the Satan in his sense of it when they are restricted to the religion of the delegation, because it is a debt that they agreed upon all of them that it is a right that it has come As long as the heavens and the earth, and in the sentence, is the one who is intended from the Satan's steps, the youths who are accumulated in the meeting of that project.And the one who has been: This speech is signed by Muslims, O those who believe in the year, enter all of the peace, that is, they are on the authority of Islam, while you are not.Get out of it, nor from something from its parts, and do not follow the steps of the Satan, that is, and do not fulfill the youths that you throw to you, the companions of the delusion, and the one who said: This face is sure of what is before this verse and after it, but what is before this verse is what God Almighty mentioned in (p-177) in the description of that in the end of that The earth is to spoil in it and what we mentioned there is that what is meant by the meeting of the young people to the Muslims, as if he was upset, he said: Do you have to Islam and do not follow those The hypocrites, and after this verse, it is the Almighty saying: Do they only look for God to come to them in the shadow of the dignity [the cow: 210] means that They are released to the infidels, their afflictions have not stopped their saying with this true religion except on the things that are invalid, such as that God will come to them in the shadow of the shadow.If it is said: the one who is eager to the thing is said to him: he is upon him, but it is not said to him: enter into it, and the mentioned in the verse is his saying: enter.We said: If the one in the house knows that he has in the future, it is a release of it, so it is not forbidden to command its entry into the future, and if there is a case, if there is a case, if there is a case, if there is a case, if there is a case He was in it other than the case that he entered, then if he is in the second time, he may come out of it, and it is true that he is commanded to enter it, and the one who knows that the one who is known is that the one who is known is that the one who knows the believer Sigans Belief in the sleep and the essence, and others, are not the case, so it is not forbidden that God Almighty command them to enter into the future in Islam.Fifth: that the peace be upon the verse is the right to be reconciled and the exhaustion and the dispute, and the estimation: O you who believe, enter, enter the peace And those who are in the beginning of religion and the infection of the Baloi in it, and do not follow the steps of the Satan that he will take you on the request of the world So break and go your wind [Al -Amran: 103] and he said: O you who believe, be patient [Al -Amran: 200] and he said: And keep the love of God Amr: 103] And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Other faces: one of them: that his saying: O you who believe in a sign of knowledge and believing in the heart, and say it: Enter in the peace of the peace, This is because disobedience is contrary to God and His Messenger, so it is correct to be called its blessing with peace, or it is what is meant by it, as they are in critics, and those who are in power The prohibitions, and that because our belief is that faith remains with the preoccupation with sins, and this is a phenomenon.And the second: that what is meant by the peace is as is satisfied, and his heart was not forced to what was narrated in the hadith: And the third of it: that what is meant is to leave the righteousness as it is in its saying: And if they pass through the language, pass a dignity [Al -Furqan: 72] and in his saying: Take the pardon The ignorant [Al -Arif: 199] This is the words in the faces of the interpretations of this verse.The loyal question: Al -Qafal said “is all“ it is correct to return to the commanders with entry, that is, enter all of you in the peace, and do not separate, and do not separate, and do not separate.The Arabs say: I saw the people all and enough, and I saw the women as sufficients and reconciles to return to Islam, that is, enter in Islam all, that is, in all his parts, he said: God: This is the way to see the interpretation because they were commanded to do all of them, and the meaning of adequate in the language of the impermissible, it is said: I have not said: Stop the fold because it prevented the reward from spreading, and it was said to the kindness of the hand: it is enough that it is stopped by the path of the body, and a man who is sufficient for any The adequate is the obedience, then it became a name for the college sentence, and that is because the meeting prevents separation and abnormalities, so say: “Enter in the” Parties (P-178) Islam, where the Islam is ended, so you will be enough to leave anything From its parts, or the meaning is entering all of you until you prevented one of not entering it.As for the saying of the Almighty: Do not follow the steps of the Satan His saying: I followed his steps.And the steps of the collection of a step, and that may be presented.As for the saying of the Almighty: It is a clear enemy, and the father of the Muslim Al -Asfani said: “It is clear” from the characteristics of the vicinity who is Arabized from his guerrilla, and the one who says: This meaning is its saying: Ham and the book shown [smoke: 2] and it does not mean that it is indicated except for that.If it was said: How can the Satan be able to describe that it is clear with that we do not see itself and do not hear its words.We said: God is exalted when he explained his hostility to Adam and forgot him, so this is true that it is described as a clear enemy, even if he did not witness, and he is not the same: A man in a country far away, it is true that it is said: There is an enemy shown to you, and if he does not witness it immediately, and I have another face in it; It is that the origin is in the pieces of cutting, and the Bayan is called a bayna for this meaning, for it is cut off some of the rituals of some, so the description of the Satan is that it is the same The cost of his souls from obedience, reward and satisfaction.If it was said: the enemy of the Satan is either for us to be the reason for the intention of the delivery of the pain and the conquest to us at once, or by the reason that it is in the authority In vain, if it was like that, we would have fallen into the diseases, pains and hardships, and it is known that it is not like that, and if the second is, it is also invalid, because whoever accepts it from that Suffering it as he said: I would not have a sultan for you, except that I called you, so you answered me [Ibrahim: 22] If you prove this, how is it said: It is an enemy, what is the same?Answer: It is an enemy of the two faces with; As for where he is trying to deliver the war to us, he is like that, except that God Almighty forbade him from that, and he will not be obligated from his being, who is a person who is able to communicate to us.Where it is presented to the bosses, and it is known that adorning the sins and the meetings of the youths.That is one of the greatest bonds of hostility.
