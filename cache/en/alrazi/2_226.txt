The Quranic researcher (P-69) “The ruling is the righteous, while it is related to the abuse and divorce.Determine the divorce, for God is a knowledgeable, the Almighty saying: For those who hope from their women, the four months will be given The divorce is that God is a knowledgeable in the verse: The first question: I am a question, and he will give up, and he will be given up, and the name is not, and the name is from it.With tension, Abu Ubaidah narrated a luminous, a luminous, and a luminous, three languages, and in the sentence, the gods, the division, the right, and all the solutions are all phrases, and in the words God Almighty: “I did the disagreement of the estimated.” And a thick said: The heart of the Alawiya is preserved for his right, so if the vengeance has come from it, this is the meaning of the memorial according to the origin of the language, but in the first place Leave the slowdown, as if he said: God does not bring you, nor does I bite you, nor do I close you, and from the interpreters who said: In the verse, it is deleted.Their women, except that it is deleted for the rest of it.The legitimacy was used for this guarantee.* * * The second question: It was narrated that the abuse in the ignorance was divorced, Said ibn al -Musayyib said: The man did not want the woman and does not love to marry it, so it is not.He approached her, so he left her with that, neither a good nor with the same, and the abuse of it is the harbinger of the woman, then the people of Islam were doing that as well, so God is still, so God is removed from that A period of time until he sees and contemplates, then if he sees the reconciliation in the leaving of this harmed, then he did, and if he sees the reconciliation in the separation from the woman.The third question: The servant of God read: “Awa from their women.” Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, read: “They divide from their women.” As for his saying: (from their women), then it is a question, which is that it is said: the incorrect is to say: a solution so that so on or like that, so I did not see it In word (from)?The answer is from two vicinity: the first: to be intended: they have one of their women.The second: that in this oath, it was guaranteed in the sense of the distance, as if it was said: they are far from their women who are funded or divided.As for the saying of the Exalted: the four months are listed, so I know that the tampering and the waiting is said, it is said: I was lined up by the thing (P-70), and it is said, and it is said to me, and it is said: That is, it will be stabilized, and the addition of the confusion to the four months of adding the source to the custody, as its saying: between them A day, a day, that is, a day, and the same is a lot.As for his saying: (If they fulfill), then we are: if they returned, and the one in the language is the return of the thing to what was before it, and this is what was said to what is the one who is tired of the shadow Return: Female, and the people of the Arabism separated between the people and the shadow, so they said: The one was not in the east; Because it was the sun, and the shadow was not in the time because it was not the sun.And in paradise is a shadow and there is no in it; Because there is no sun in it, God Almighty said: And the remains of a murdered [Al -Waqi'a: 30] The category and the category, they told them about the Arabs, that is, the speedy return of the anger to the advanced state, and it was said to what God responded to the Muslims: To them, he returned to them, so he said: (If they fulfill), it is: if they returned with what they have gone on to leave it, then God is forgiven, if God is forgiven With his wife, as he is a merciful forgiveness for all repentance.As for the saying of the Exalted: If they are determined to divorce, then God is a knowledgeable, so know that the determination is the contract of the heart on the thing, it is said: the determination of the thing, the intention of the thing, and the intention of the thing.And I was determined to do, that is, I divided, and the divorce is a source of divorce, the woman was divorced by divorce, and he said: I was divided with the sake of the mother, and he said: Among the divorce is the one, and the meaning of divorce is the solution of the contract of marriage with what is permissible in the law, and its origin is from the divorce, which is the release, so the divorce is a phrase from the divorce.This is what is related to the interpretation of the verse.* * * As for the rulings, there are many, and we remember some of what the verse indicated on it in the questions: the first question: Every husband is perceived by the barrier, and it is a person who is in the righteousness, The law is that it is correct to give up, and this restriction is a ritual and opposite.As for the ritual, it is that everyone who was also valid, and the rulings are separated from him: the first: the one is correct to give the dhimmi, and he is the saying of Abu Hanifa, and he said: Muhammad: It is not valid to be glorified by God Almighty and is correct with divorce and emancipation.We have the words of the Almighty: For those who hope from their women, he will be filled with four months, and this general is the infidel and the Muslim.The second judgment: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The time of the abuse is not different with tenderness and freedom.One of them was free and the other was a delicate, and when Abu Hanifa and the king of God be pleased with them, she was described by the tenderness, except that when Abu Hanifa is a good man The man’s lightning, as they said in divorce.We have the appearance of his saying: For those who hope from their women, all, and specialization is the disagreement of the phenomenon; Because the estimation of this period was for the sake of the sake of the one that returns to the jelly and the pulp, and it is the lack of patience on the separation of the husband, so it is the way, so it is the way, so it is the way, so it is the way, so it is the way, so it is the way, so the husband, so that it is the way, so that Like menstruation, the duration of breastfeeding and the duration of curse.The third judgment: it is correct to give in the event of contentment and anger, and Malik said: It is only valid in the event of anger.We have the back of this verse.The return is true to it that it is one of its women, with the evidence that if he said: My waters are tall, and the divorce was on it, and if it is proven that it is from his women, he will enter His saying: For those who hope from their women.As for the reverse of this judgment, which is that whoever is not conceived from the barrier is not valid to be valid, then it is a judgment: the first judgment: the verbal of the pure is correct; Because it collects as the solution is, it is the incident in its right to remove, and that does not affect him, and because it is within the general public.The second judgment: it is obligatory, if it remains from it that it can be collected with it, it is true that it is true, and if it does not remain in it, one of them is said: Hanifah, may God be pleased with him.The second: that it is correct for the general meaning of this verse; Because the intention of the one who is in the right is to get it from it.The second footnote: to be a husband, so if he said to a foreigner: God does not gather you.Then we marked it, it was not a matter; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: for those who hope from their women, he will be a four -year -old who is known that this judgment is for them, not for others.[The infidels: 6] That is, for you, not for you.* * * The disbelief of the right?There is a saying, the new one is the most correct, and the saying of Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him, is that he answers the disbelief An expiation for it.(The pilgrimage of the saying: God does not approach you, then bring it closer, and between saying: God does not speak to you and then speak to it), and the argument of the saying is the saying of God: Forgive, merciful, and he who is in the authority of them: one of them: that the infidels, even if it was a duty, was mentioned by God.Because the need is here, he calls for its knowledge, and the delay of the Bayan from the time of the need is not permissible.The second: It is exalted as he did not remember the atonement of the infidels, a warning against its stipulations by saying: If they fulfill, then God is forgiven, merciful, and forgiven.The first of them is to answer and say: The infidels are left here because it is the Almighty Show it in the Qur’an and on the tongue of the Messenger of God ﷺ in the brightest of the positions.As for his saying: (Forgiving, merciful), it is indicated by the nickname of punishment, but the punishment of punishment does not contradict the action, as the repentance of the adultery and the killing of the adultery and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one That is obligatory for him to limit and retribution, but if the case is in the payment without God, as if he said: If I slow you, then you worship me free, or you are a divorce, or a sacrifice, or a divorce, or a divorce, He said: If I slow you, may God protect you from a neck, a charity, a fast, a pilgrimage, or a prayer, so will he be a baby?The Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, has a saying: He said in the Qadim: He is not a baby, and with him, Ahmad said in the appearance of the novel.Its indication is that the gathering is in the ignorance, and then it was proven that the ignorance of the ignorance in this section is the solution of God, and also it was narrated that he said: So the launch of the case is understood from God, and he said in the grandfather, and it is the saying of Abi Hanifa, Malik, and the group of scholars, may God have mercy on them: He will be Mawlid Because the utterance of the abuse is all, and the two sayings are suspended, then he will give him a compass.Related to the commitment of near to the dhimma, so it has what is in the vow of the chicken.And it contains sayings: I am correct: that he has the disbelief of the right.The second: The one has to do with what was called.And the third: that he chooses between (P-72) as the disbelief of the right and between what is called, and the benefit of these two words is that if we say: He will be the one who will be The matter is narrowed by it until it is coming or releasing, and if we say: It is not a moller who is not narrowed by the matter.* * * The third question: they disappeared in the approach of the period of payment on sayings: the first: Ibn Abbas said that he is not a minor until he does not.The second: the saying of Al -Hasan Al -Basri and Isaac: Any time is a solution to it was a muller, even if it was a day, and these two are in the end of the severity.The third: Abu Hanifa and Al -Tuiri said that he is not a baby until he is around to be solved by four months or as he increased.Al -Rabaa: The saying of Al -Shafi’i, Ahmad, and Malik, may God be pleased with them: He is not a fundamentalist until the period increases by four months.And the excess of the disagreement between Abu Hanifa and Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with them, that if it is more than four of the four months, it is four of them, and this is the time of the time The woman asks for the woman to ask for the husband with the vote or by divorce, then if the husband is forbidden from them, the ruler divorced her to him, and on the authority of Abu Hanifa: If the rituals are lost With itself, and the argument of Al -Shafi’i from the faces: the first pilgrimage: that the fulfillment in his saying: if they fulfill, then God is Forgiving, Most Merciful And if they are determined to divorce, then God is a knowledgeable that requires the fact that these two rulings are hungry, which is broken from the four -year -old.If it was said: What you mentioned is a variety; Because his saying: If they fulfill, and if they are determined to break the detail of his saying: for those who hope from their women and detailing, the detail will be followed by the separation I have this month, for if you honored me, I stayed with you, or I will not leave you.We said: This is weak; Because his saying: For those who hope from their women, this period is given, indicates the two things, and the fulfillment of his saying: If you fulfill and return the mind of this The judgment is a hidden one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was mentioned in this period, by disagreement of the example that he mentioned and he said: I will come down to you I was traveling; Because there is the fulfillment of delayed from that descent, but here, the fulfillment is a masculinity of the masculinity of the abuse and the remembrance of the table, so it is necessary and it is that it is not the fulfillment of the fulfillment.The one who is the one who is the two things, and this is an apparent words.The second pilgrimage to the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him: that his saying, even if they are determined to divorce, are clear that the divorce is the rhythm of the husband, and the one who says: God is up to Him, the divorce falls with the past, not by the rhythm of the husband.If it was said: the divorce: divorce in itself.What is meant is from his saying: If they are determined to divorce the advanced metaphor.We said: This is distant; Because his saying: And if they are determined to divorce, it is necessary that it is with its meaning: and if those who hope for the divorce are determined, then the hope is determined, and this is necessary that it is necessary that it is that it is necessary Gathering, and the divorce is the attachment of determination, and the resolve is delayed from the determination, so when the divorce is delayed from the determination, there is no way, and it is not.To be determined or advanced, and this is the case of cutting that the divorce in this verse is a stimulant of that gathering, and this is an apparent words.The third pilgrimage: that his saying is up to the Almighty: If they are determined to divorce, then God is a knowledgeable person that requires that the husband be released from the husband, and that is what is not.The estimation of the verse: If you are determined to divorce and divorce, then God is hearing for their words, knowing what is in their hearts.(P-73), then it was said: Why not Hear for that giving?We said: This is excluded; Because this threatening did not get the same way, but it was obtained from something after the guest, and it is a word other than it, so that it is the same To him.The fourth pilgrimage: that his saying is up to the Almighty: If they fulfill, and if they are determined to release it between the two things, and that is required that the time to be established, and the time of them is the time Hanifa is not like that.The Fifth Hajj: The pace with itself is not a divorce, but it is it A solution to the abstinence from the intercourse with a special period, except that the law is a measure of time known from time; That is because the man may leave the gathering of women for a period of time, not by the cause When the intended of the hardened, and when the length and minors were in this section, it is not something that is stubborn, between the exaltation of the exaltation between the short and the one, then the one who is the same, then it is the same.The hardened, and that is not necessary to get the divorce, but the one who dreamed of the rule of the law at the appearance of the purpose of the muddy is that it is commanded by the one who is the one who is blessed with it.Restricting the abuse, and this meaning is considered to be considered on the legs, as we said in the sake of the wandering in the period of curse and others.The Hajj of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, that Abdullah ibn Masoud reads: “If they fulfill them in them.” And the correct answer: that the anomalous reader is anchor; Because everything was a Qur’an, it must be proven by frequency, where it was not proven with frequency, we cut off that it is not a Qur’an, and the first people are in this man She is touched that the name is not from the Qur’an, and too, it was clear that the verse is incompatible with three things that indicate that this is not in the category.The abnormal when it was contrary to it, it was necessary to cut it with its corruption.
