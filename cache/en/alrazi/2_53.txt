The researcher of the Quranic is the Almighty, and when we came to Moses, the Book and the Fruits, you may be guided.Know that this is the year-old and what is meant by the differences is enticed to be the supply and that it is something within (P-73) and the gums and that it is something that is out of the time.Three sections that are more important to them and the first condemnation that the severity has two characteristics: its color is a descending book, and its voracity is a difference between the truth As your saying: I saw the absurdity and the one who wants the college man between the good and the chances and his counterpart, the saying of the Almighty: And we have come to Moses and Aaron al -Faraqan: [48] As for the second reporting, it is that what is meant is from the differences in the mandarin of the religion of religion, because if the truth is clear, the truth is distinguished from the false Antarctic, which is the basis of the principles of religion and its vastness.As for the third reporting, it is one of its face Between the right and falsehood.And the second: that the one who is intended from the difference is the victory and the difference that God has brought to the children Al -Juman [Anfal: 41] and the intention that God has gave a day, and that is because before the appearance of victory, every one of the two shadows signs that he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.And his friend is the mortal, so if the victory appears, the most likely is from the one who is the most desperate, and the sincere amplitude is separated.And the third of it: Qartb said: The difference is the separation of the sea for peace be upon him.If you say: This has become a muddy in his saying: “And when we separated the sea on you and white, then the Almighty said after that: that you may not be guided It is only mentioned by the hindrance of the guidance.I said: The answer to the first is that it is not shown in his saying: “And when we separated the sea on you, that this was for the sake of Moses, peace be upon him.On the way of elaboration, and on the authority of the second that the difference of the sea was from the evidence, so perhaps what is meant is that when we came to Moses, the difference of the sea, they inferred that Peace be upon him, and that is the guidance and also the guidance that the win and the survivor will be wanted as it is intended by the significance, as if it is the Almighty that he has given them the book and the book is the good Their salvation from the characteristic obtained an urgent blessing.He knew that among the people who mixed, he thought that the differences are the Qur’an, and that it was revealed to Moses, peace be upon him, and that is invalid because the differences are the one who separates the right Likewise, there is no face to specialize this The memorization of the Qur’an.Others said: The meaning: When Moses came to us, it means the delegation, and it is praiseworthy ﷺ the difference, so that you will be guided by it, O people of the book.He had money to this saying from the scholars of the grammar, a fabric, and a dotb, and this is a strong arbitrary, other than the need for a bit.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Perhaps you will be guided, then the interpretation of perhaps and the interpretation of the dedications is presented, and you have inferred the one who said: The Almighty wanted to pay off from all, and that is the saying of those who said: He wanted the infidelity from the infidel, and also if it is when he is up to them: He creates the ritual, and he will be lost, What is the benefit is to download the book and the difference and say: Perhaps you will be guided and learned that the deduction if it creates it, then do not influence to remove the book for it Displaced, nor a book, to obtain the appetite, and if he had descended from the one book, a thousand writers did not create a thousand writers, and the appetite was not created in them, when he did the good I descended the book to be guided?Know that this speech may be presented with the countlessness with the answer, and God knows.
