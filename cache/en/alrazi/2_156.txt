The researcher of the Qur’an, the Almighty, those who have been afflicted with a calamity, they said that we are God and that we have returned to those of them with the prayers of their Lord He said: The preaching of the patients is clear in this verse that the human being is to be patient, and that the evil is how it is?Then in the verse: (P-140) the first question: Know that these fans may be from the verb of God Almighty and may be from the act of the servant, as for the servant of the servant God is the same as the fear of the place, the burning and the thunderbolt, and others, and who is from the act of the servant, so it is that the Arabs were gathering on the enmity of the Prophet, and the hunger is ﷺ The poverty may be from God that their money will be damaged, and it may be from the servant that they are overwhelmed by it, and they will be wrapped in it, and the money of the money is done by God It affects the money and the precursors, and from the enemy, it is because the people are to be associated with them, they do not empty the lands of lands, and the incompetent of the soul is done by God.The second question: The judge said: It is an adequate that did not add this misfortune to its soul, but rather it is blind It is attained by God Almighty, and it is attained by worshipers; Because in the two directions, all in it is a mandate, and if he adjusted it to his disagreement, it was a blessing to seek to perform it, for the one who gets it from him is that he is the one who is in the authority of him.Judgment, righteousness, justice, goodness, and goodness, and that the obligation is to be satisfied with him and leave the reward, and all of that is within it under his saying: We have to be in the authority of God.The matters to him and the satisfaction with his judgment, while they are permeated by him; Because he does not judge only the right as he said: God is judging the right and those who call from it without it, they will not be spent with anything [Ghafir: 20], but if it comes down from the one who comes down from it So he will be used to return to God Almighty in the fairness from him, and that his anger and anger will be injured, so he does not go beyond what is not permissible for him from his anger, We are for God because he is the one who has been obligatory for you to do this way until he does not equate his command, as if he says in the first: We have to arrange for us, how can he It is described as how it is.The third question: the hopes of the Kasayi in some of the narratives from (I) and the (God) and those who are in tramm Until it became in the home of the single word, the hatred and the zaei said: It is not permissible to hope (we) with other than the name of God Almighty, but it is necessary for that, because the origin is in the wareh Likewise, it is not permissible to hope (even) and (but).* * * As for his saying: We are God, and we have returned to Him in his minds: the first question: Abu Bakr al -Warraq said that we have a declaration from us with the king: I have to do the king: With the depreciation, and know that the return to it is not a phrase for the resignation to a place or one side, because that is what is referred to God, but what is meant is that it becomes to you, and it does not come to you.That is the last house; Because when there is no one who has no benefit or harm, and as long as they are in the world, there may be other than God.Hope, as it is said: The king and the state return to it, not in the sense of the resignation, but rather in the sense of ability and the leaving the ritual.The second question: This indicates that this is a declaration of mission and emerging, and the confession that it will be rewarded for the patients on the destiny Well.The third question: His saying: We have a sign of his being satisfied with everything that he descended in immediate Satisfied with everything that will be revealed after that, from his reward for what was (P-141) of it, and from the matter of the matter of the matter to him on what he descended from him, and from what is wrong with him Suffering himself, satisfied with what God promised him from the reward in the hereafter.The following question: The news in this section is many.One of them: On the authority of the Prophet ﷺ: “Whoever returns to the misfortune: God bless his calamity, and the best of his punishment, and made him a righteous successor.” And the second: “It was narrated that he was warmed by the Messenger of God ﷺ He said:“ For God, and we have returned to Him.And the third of it: the mother of Salamah said: The father of Salama told me that he - peace and blessings be upon him - said: They returned to them, when I was caught by my affliction, and he rewarded me in it and compensated me for good from it, except that God has rewarded it and compensated it for it.This hadith, and I said this saying: God Almighty fulfilled me - peace and blessings be upon him.And he pushed it: Ibn Abbas said: God told that the believer, if he greeted the command of God, is up and returned and returned and returned when his affliction is the book of God, the best of God.And realize the path of guidance.Fifth: On the authority of Omar - may God be pleased with him - he said: Yes, the nomadic, and they are: Those are the prayers of them from their Lord, mercy, and the blessing Ibn Masoud said: Because he was more heaven, I love me than to say anything that God has spent It is.As for his saying: Those are the prayers of their Lord and mercy.Then later.* * * As for his saying: And those are the guided, in his faces: one of them: they are the guided of this way connected to its owner to every good.And the second: those who are guided to paradise, who are bound by reward.And the third of it: those who are guided by the brakes of what they have, and the closeness in which it becomes within the promise until it is his kindness to what he mentioned from the prayers and mercy Except and what is meant by them is that they are bound by reward, paradise, and the way to it; Because all of that is within the appetite, and if it is not forbidden to want that they are disciplined with his etiquette, the one who holds it with what is obligatory and commanded, he said: The verse is on two rules: unjust and nose.The nose is a manifestation of his saying: We are to God and we have returned, because in his condolences, he is a reward for it, so that he will not pay him if he hears it, and he listens to him, With his grandfather and his existence in the debt of God and the steadfastness on him and his obedience, and he was told about the dawood of Al -Tayy A Muslim can grieve because he knows that every misfortune has reward.Let us take the interpretation of this verse with the consent of the satisfaction with the judiciary, so we say: The servant is patience with the pleasure The attraction, as for the narration of the behavior, whoever is a face: one of them: when he did his heart money to something, and his risk has turned to something that made that thing, a person who is a good The heart is directed to the world of the grandfather to the side of the Jerusalem, because it is Adam - peace be upon him - when his heart was attached to the paradise, he made it a murmur, so it is a time.With the remembrance of God, and when he was forgotten, he will be in Jacob Baysaf on them, peace be upon them, and the separation falls between them until the rest of Yaqoub with the remembrance of the truth, and the right of the truth - - One of the people of Mecca in the victory and insistence has become one of the most severe people until (P -142) said: “What a prophet is not like what I have been in.” And the second: that this thing does not make something clear, but it raises it from the between, until it does not remain, neither the calamity nor the mercy, then it will return to the servant.And the third of it: that the servant when you signed something that God gave him a good and medium, good than his signs, so the servant will be brought up, and he returns to the chapter of God.As for the way of attraction, it is as he said - peace be upon him -: “A attraction of attractions The truth is parallel to the work of the two rituals.And whoever attracted the right to itself, it has become cloudy; Because the truth is a majority, not a single, and the description of the Lord, the attribute of the servant, the servants, and the gratitude is overwhelmed by the servants, not by the right, and the right of the right, The adjective of the slave is a metaphor, and the truth is overwhelmed by the metaphor, not by the against, and the dominant is the one who turns from a row to a row that is met with it, and the servant if he enters the authority of the authority He himself, and he became all his heart, his thought, and his sense of acceptance, and he was overwhelmed with him, and he was unaware of others.A virginity of the lineage to him, and the servant becomes like that, like the Paradise of himself and the fortune of himself, and he will become satisfied with the judgment of the right However, the suspicion of the ritual.
