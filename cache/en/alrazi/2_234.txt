The Quranic researcher is the third ruling of the number of people who died from you, and they will be wrapped in marriage.A wing of you, while they did in themselves with the well -known and God of what you do expert, the words of the Almighty, and those who die from you and give it to you Four months and ten years, if they reach them, then they will not be a wing to you, while they did in themselves with the well -being, and God is what you do: They died with their deaths and they are died, God Almighty said: God dies the soul when its death [Al -Zamer: 42] and the origin of the death is the one who takes the time of the time, and the one is complete.He has found his life completely complete, and it is said: So -and -so passed away: And he fulfilled his sake and his age, and he has a reading upon him, peace be upon him: (died) by opening the yaa.* * * As for his saying: They are inferior to its meaning: they are left, and the past nor the source is used from it, asking for it by leaving it, and the same is the same, and it is called in it.These two transgressions and the matter of them are the ones, it is said: so -and -so is called so and virginity, and it is said: He called him and his atom, but the past and the source are not.And the women are the women, and the Arabs call the man a husband and his destiny is a husband for him, and they may have attached to it.The second question: His saying: Those who are in effect and have no news, and they were dispersed in his news on sayings: The first: that the additive is deleted and the opposite: You missed you.The second, which is the saying of the fear, is the ability: they are stirred after them, except that it was brought down to its appearance; Like his saying: the thickness of the title of their life, and the words of the Almighty: (P-108) and for those who were patient and forgiven that that is for those who resolve the affairs [Al-Shura: 43].And the third, which is the saying of the cold: those who die from you and virginity, are married, their waves are lukewarm.He said: And the start of the beginning is not a strange; He said: Say: I will tell you about the human being of that fire [Hajj: 72] means the fire, and its saying: a beautiful patience [Yusuf: 18].If it was said: You are guaranteed, here is an added start, and that is one thing, but rather two things, and the examples that you mentioned in which one is one.We said: As the beginning of the beginning, he has also returned the addition of the added beginner, the Almighty said: It is not deceived by the one who disbelieves in the country: 197] The meaning: their flipping is a little.Al -Rabaa: It is the saying of the Kasayi and the free one, that his saying is up to the Almighty: Those who die of you are a beginner, except that the exhibition is not the same With a bit of judgment, dwelt to their waves, then there is no crime It reminds that starting news, and the cold and the dagger are denied; Because the start of the beginning is referred to.* * * The third question: We have shown us when the meaning of the table was presented, and we have explained the good in his saying: with themselves, and we have indicated that this is if it is, and if this is the one who is the one who is the one who is from it And we have indicated the useful in the enemy of the memorization of the matter to the news of the news.The following question: Its saying: ten days are mentioned by the memorial of the ethnicity with the fact that the intention is ten days, and they mentioned in the excuse of it: Days; This is that the start of the month will be from the night, so when the loyalty was the first, she was overwhelmed; Because the parents are stronger than the seconds, Ibn al -Sakit said: They say: We are five of the month, and they prevail over the nights over the days, as they did not remember the days, then they said, then they said, then they said, then they said: We have finished five days.The second: that these days are the days of sadness and the deceased, and the same as these days are called the Levant on the way of the slogan, as they say: “We have come to us.” For the emirate of the pilgrims.And the third is mentioned by the cold: which is that the ten female femininity is because it is intended for the period, meaning: the tenth of the duration, and that time is every period of it.The four: some jurisprudence went to the appearance of the verse, and he said: If four months and ten months pass for it, then it will be for the sake of the elders Al -Awazi and Abu Bakr Al -Asam.* * * The fifth question: It was narrated from Abu Al -Aali that God is the Glory of Him, but it is the same as the number of this destiny, because the child is blowing in it the spirit in the twenty The optical good.The sixth question: Know that this number is a duty in every woman who died of her husband except in two pictures: one of them: to be a nation, then it is a nation, so it is a nation, so it is a nation, so it is a nation, so it is a nation, so it is a nation.The half of the freedom, and Abu Bakr al -Asam said: I have a number of freedoms, and they are touched by the appearance of the verse, and also God is the Almighty, he made the place of the lamb in the right of the right The period, then put the bearing, is a blessing in which there is free and dance, so that the one who is in addition to this period must be bought in it, and it is in it, and the sake of the jurisprudence said: This period is possible, and in the place of pregnancy is not possible, the difference appeared.The second image: that the intention is: if you are pregnant, then you will be ahead of the lamb place, then if you put the bearing, you will come, and if it is after the death of the Peace be upon him: the length of the two luggage is paused, and the evidence is upon him the Qur’an and Sunnah.[Divorce: 4] And among the people who made this verse specific to the general saying of the Almighty: and those who die From you, and they warn of marriages, and Al -Shafi’i did not say that for two ways: The first: that each one of these two verses is better than the other than one side, and more than one face; Because the bearer has passed away from her husband and may not go dead, as the one who dies from her husband may be a bearer and may not be, and it was not the same, and it was not the matter.One of the two verses is specialized for the last.And the second: that his saying: The signs of the loads are their sake to put their bears [divorce: 4] Rather, the Aqeeb mentioned the remembrance of the divorcees, so he may say: It is in the divorce, not in the divorce About her husband.So, for these two captives, the Shafi’i was not dependent on the door on the Qur’an, but he was dependent on the Sunnah, and it is what Abu Dawood narrated with his chain of transmission.Under Saad Bin Khawla, so she died of her in the Hajj of the obedience while she was pregnant, and she was born after the death of her husband with the half of a month.For the speech, then some people said to her: You are not with a while until you pass by four months and ten months, I said: So I asked the Prophet ﷺ I analyzed when I put my pregnancy, so he commanded me to marry if I seemed to me.If you know this origin, then it is a separation: the first: there is no difference in the number of death between the small and the great.Ibn Abbas said: There is no number for it before the income.This is a stirred saying; Because the verse is general in the right of all.The second judgment: If four months and ten are fulfilled, its number will be lost, and if it does not see its habit of menstruation in it.Malik said: Do not expire until she sees her habit of menstruation in those days, for example, if she is back to menstruate every month, then he did in the time of the It was her habit to menstruate every two months, so that she had two menstruation, and if it was usual to menstruate in every four months, then it is a time, and if it is a period of time, if it is a time In every five months, you will be one of the months.The Hajj of the Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him, indicated that it was the same as the one who died from it.This destiny is sufficient, and then Al -Shafi’i said: If she is close to her soul, her soul is absent, as the same is if she had been affiliated, she must be reserved.The third judgment: If the husband dies, if it remains from the month of death, more than ten days, then the second and third month of the month is taken with the family, and the whole of the family, the whole of the family Then the first month will be completed with the fifty day, and then the ten days will be included, and if he died and he has remained than the month less than ten days, the one who is a good thing With the family and the tenth of the sixth of the sixth month.* * * The question The seven: The jurisprudence is collected that this verse is a copyist, as far as it is in addition to the insects, and if it is advanced in the recitation, it is not the same as the father We copy it, and we will remember his words after God Almighty.And progress in recitation does not prevent delay in descent; As the journalist is not repeated on the installation of the descent, but rather the formation of recitation in the Qur’an is the formation of Gabriel with the command of God Almighty.* * * The eighth question: they disagreed that this number is caused by the death or the knowledge of the mouth, so each of them said: I did not know the mouth of the absence of it.The enemy, and they took the highness that he said: They pursue themselves with themselves and do not get unless you intend this patch, and the intention is to the table, and it is not the same The reason is (P-110) the death, so if the period would be destroyed or more, then it was informed of the death of the death of the zoo, it must be accustomed to what was fulfilled, and they said: It is sufficient to make up for this period.* * * Decoration.This is the word like a summary; Because it is not in it that it is lurking in anything, except that we say: the abstinence of the marriage is unanimously upon it, and the abstinence is from the abandonment of the abandon Driver and need, and the tenderness of decorating is a duty; When it was narrated from Aisha and Hafsa that the Messenger of God ﷺ He said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in God and the last day to be united by one dead, for a while, for the dead, for the dead, for the time Four months and ten months.Because the hadith requires the solution of dignity, not his duty, and God knows.And they took what was narrated from the names of the daughter of Amis, who said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: * * * The believers, indicated that the speech with this terrifying is specialized in the believers only.And his answer: that the believers, when they were the workers with that, summarized them with the remembrance; As his saying: You are a warning of those who fear it [the disputes: 45] with that it was a warning to all; To say the Almighty: Let the two scientists be a vow [Al -Furqan: 1].* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: If they reach their sake, then the meaning is that this period that is the time of the number is lost Those who take care of the contract, and it was said: the speech with the rulers and the peace of the Muslims; That is because they are They married in the period of the number, and each one must prevent them from that if he is able to prevent, for if he is rewarded, he must seek help from the authority; This is because the intended is from this number that it does not believe in the detection of its hope for the water of its first husband.And in the verse is a third aspect, which is that there is no wing on you, its estimation: there is no wing on the women and you, and then he said: So, then they did in themselves with the goodness of any Because it is against the denial that is not good, and that is the permissible from the marriage if it is aggravated for the restaurants expert.* * * He remained in the verse: The first question: If his appearance requires that what is meant by what is unique is the woman with his act, and marriage is not like that; It is only fulfilled with others, so it must be carried on that of what is fulfilled by the woman alone from adornment, and the kindness and others.* * * To say to him: So, there is no wing to you, as they did in themselves.And adding the verb to the actor is submitted to the monsters; Because this is the truth in the word, and the companions of Al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him (P-111), holds that this marriage is only valid from the guardian; Because his saying: There is no wing on you with a speech with the guardians, and if not for this contract that it is only valid from the guardian, otherwise it will not be addressed by saying:
