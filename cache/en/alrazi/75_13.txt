The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, is up to him: No, and he is a deterrent from the request of the pass, not the ministers of the mighty and the ritual: The righteous said that the son of the son of Malik: The people are upon us in you, there is nothing but the Siuuf and the parts of the Qena, and the meaning of the verse is that there is nothing.* * * Then the Almighty said: To your Lord, the one who is stable, and in it, and Jahan: one of them: that the stable is in the sense of the strained, in the sense that they are not able to do so, that they do not.And they set up to others, as he said: to your Lord, the Raqla [Al -Alam: 8], and to God, the destiny [Fatir: 18], but to God the affairs of the matters [Al -Shura: 53] and that to your Lord: 42].The second: That the meaning be to your Lord, who are stable, that is, the position of their decision of heaven or fire, that is, the delegate of that to his will, whoever wants to enter the garden.His Excellency said: The human being predicts the day and delayed what was presented in his work, and with what was delayed of the work he did not do, or with what he did, or what he did, and what he did, and what he did from his money So he succeeded him, or with what was presented in the work of good and evil and what was delayed of a good or bad Sunnah, so he worked after him, and on the authority of Mujahid: that he is an infidel of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a good man His saying: So he tells them what they have done, God has counted and forgotten [Al -Mujdalah: 6] and he said: And we wrote what they came and their effects [Yass: 12] and know that the appearance is that this is this The offer and the accountant and the adultery of the work, and it is permissible for it to be with death, and that if he dies showing his seat from paradise and fire.His exalted say: Rather, the human being is a vision, I know that he is up to what he said: The human being predicts his day with his money, he said: Rather, he does not need until he does Because his soul is a witness in his form, an action of those actions, presented to it, then in his saying: insight and Jahan: the first: he said: He said: It is said: so that there is quality and generosity, so it is also like that, because the human being is the harm of his mind, he knows (P-196) that what brings him closer to God and occupies him with him Happiness, and what he excludes from the obedience of God and occupies him with the world and its savings, so it is the slander, so he gave that with his tongue he is promoted, lifted and sees the right in the right The truth, but with his mind, he knows that he is a good or a good.The second: that what is intended is his wings, he witnesses him with what he did, so he witnessed himself with the testimony of his wings, and this is the saying of Ibn Abbas and Said, As his saying: The day of their affliction and their hands and their legs [Al -Nur: 24] and his saying: And they spoke to us and see their hands and testify Yass: 65] And his saying: He witnessed them with their hearing, their eyes, and their rituals [they were separated: 20] So the insight is that it is permissible for it to be the same because it is that it is that As if it was said: Rather, the wounds of the human being, as if it was said: Rather, the wounds of the human being on the soul of the human being in insight, and Abu Ubaidah said: This distraction is for the sake A man is a narrator, a tyrant, and a science.He knew that he was the highest mentioned in the first verse that the human being informs the Day of Resurrection with his hopes.Then he mentioned in this verse that he witnessed himself with what he did, so the one said: This is from the infidels, so they deny what they did, and they will be made.And their wounds are broken.
