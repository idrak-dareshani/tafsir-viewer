The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: and remember God in the days You will know that when he mentioned what is related to the forbidden poet, the throwing was not mentioned to Jajah: one of them: that was a matter That is, except that it is the highest of the remembrance of God because they were not doing it.The second: Perhaps he did not remember the throw because in the matter of the remembrance of God in these days, it was evidenced by him, as it was from his Sunnah to be the one who said: And remember God in the days of numbers, and in which the first question is: God Almighty mentioned in your insults the pilgrims, the numbers and the days of the information, so they said: Enemies and said in Surah Al -Hajj: To testify to the benefits of them and remember the name of God in the days of information [Al -Hajj: 28], so the Shafi’i gave it to the one who is pleased The first of the pilgrimage is the last day of the day, and the numbers are three days after the day of the magic, and they are the days of honor, and it is taken over that the enemies are the days He mentioned the enemies, and the days are not given a gathering, so the least of them will be three, then he said after him: So whoever hurry up on two days, then he will not be sinned for him It is necessary that the intention be, so whoever hurry up on two days, then there is no sin on him from these numbers, and the nation gathered on the authority of this, and this is in this ruling, The honor, so we learned that the enemies are the days of the tribulation, and the locking affirmed this with what was narrated in “his interpretation” on the authority of Abd al -Rahman ibn Na`man al -Daim.A calling command called: “The pilgrimage is a definition, whoever comes to the night of a group before the dawn of the dawn, then I have realized the pilgrimage, and the days of three days, so whoever is hurry up in It was delayed, so there is no sin on him.The first: the day of alienation, which is the same day, one of the pilgrims, the people are alienated in it with me, and the second: the first day of the first is that some of the people are from this The third: the second day of the enemy, and these are the three days with the day of the sacrifice, all of the days The pride of the prayers of the prayers on what we will explain to the people of the people in it.* * * The second question: What is meant by the remembrance of these days: the remembrance of the Jamra The prayers, and the people were all together, except that they disagreed in the positions: the first position: the nation was allied on the authority of the elderly The sacrifice, then in its convergence and end.The first saying: that it starts from the afternoon on the day of the sacrifice until after the morning, from the last days of honor, so the pride will be on this saying in this prayer in Fifth The saying of Ibn Abbas and Ibn Omar, and with it, Malik and Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with them, said in one of his sayings, and the argument is in it that the matter of this is the one who is the one who has been Remember God, as your fathers remember you, then he said: And remember God in the days With this greatness, but it was mentioned in the right of the pilgrim, and the man of the people followed them in that, then the noon prayer is the first prayer that the pilgrim grows up in one of them.A prayer that they pray with in whom it is the prayer of the morning from the last days of the tribute, so this is the greatest of the right to the right of the pilgrim, which is restricted.The second saying: For the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, that he begins from the prayer of the Maghreb, the night of the sea, to the prayer of the morning from the last days The oldest after the twelve prayer.And the third saying to the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him: that he begins from the prayer of the dawn on the day The proud after the eight of the prayers, and it is the saying of the consequences, al -Suwaid, al -Nakha’i, and Abu Hanifa.And the righteous saying: that it begins with the prayer of the dawn on a day Three and twelve prayers, which is the saying of the major companions, such as Ala, Omar and Ibn Mas'oud and Ibn Abbas, and from the jurisprudence the saying of Al -Thawri, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad The Mazan and the son of Sherih, and the people do the work of the country, and it is indicated by his faces: the first: Jabir narrated that “the Prophet ﷺ prayed for the sake of the day, God is greater, and extended the pride to the era of the last days of honor.The second: that the one said by Abu Hanifa was taken at least, and this saying was taken with more, and the multiplication in the pride is the first to say it to God: [Parties: 41].The third: that this is the one; Because if he increased the proud, it is better than being decreased.And the lord: that these proud of the elderly people are attributed to the days of tornadments, so it is obligatory to bring them to the last days of tornadments.If it is said: These are the greats added to the numbers.The days of honor, so they should not be hidden on the day of the day.We said: This requires that the day of the day not grow up, and it is invalid with consensus, and also when the most in this period was the days of the honor; It is correct to add to it.The second position: Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, said: The desirable in the proud to be three cops, that is, a follower, and it is the saying of your money, and he said: Two times, the Hajj of Al -Shafi’i, what was narrated by Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr ibn Amr ibn Hazm, he said: I saw the imams in the days Three, and because it is an increase in the pride, it was the first to say it to the Almighty: Remember God a great remembrance, then the Shafi’i said: God is pleased with him: God, and God is greater, and God has praise, “Then he said: And what is more than the remembrance of God is good, and he said in the discipline: I love that he does not increase the poverty of the Messenger of God The repentance of the righteousness, so its repetition is more important than the addition of the leadership to it, and we are growing up once, so the increase will be the first of the silence, and the arrogance is the one.The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was growing up with every horse.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Whoever hurry up on two days, then he does not sin against him and whoever is delayed, then he does not sin against him for someone who fears, and he said: Who is the hurry?The answer: The owner of the “scout” said: Check and hurry to come to me, in the sense of a calf, it is said: you hurry up in the matter and hurry, and the one who said: The second question: His saying: Whoever is delayed, then there is no sin in it in it, and that is because if if he has fulfilled all that is obligatory in the pilgrimage, then what is the meaning of the pilgrimage, then what is it This is the memorial, but it is said in the right of the palace, and it is not said in the right of those who come to complete the work.The answer is from his faces: one of them: that it is up to the ears of the rushing of the path of the privatization, it is carried out that it is dangerous in the minds of the people, that whoever does not do this is the authority of this Do you not see that Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, says: The palace (P-166) is determined, and the perpetrator is not permissible, so when this involvement was a standing, there is no generosity, the crime is removed from God.And he indicated that there is no sin in the two things, if he wanted to hurry and run on the authority of the license, and if he wanted, he would not hurry and do not run on the authority of the privilege, and there is no sin in it.And the second: Some of the interpreters said: Some of them were hurrying, and among them who was delayed, then each one of the two parties is wrong with the other, so he did not A violation of the Sunnah of Hajj, and the urgent was seen The delay is contrary to the Sunnah of the Hajj, so God has revealed that there is no defect in one of the two divisions and no sin, for if he wants to hurry, and if he will not hurry.And the third of it: that the meaning in removing the ingredient from the late is for those who have increased on the shrine of the three, as if it was said: The days of the one that we want to do are three, so we are three, so we are three, so we are three, so we are three, so we are three So she accelerated the second day of it, so he would not have sinned against him, and whoever has increased it, then he was delayed from the third to the four, so he did not alienate with the general public, so there is no thing.And its elevation: that these words are mentioned in exaggeration in Bayan that the pilgrimage is due to the weight of sins and the atonement of sins, and this is the same as that if the human being is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be If you take the poison, then there is no harm, and if you do not go beyond, there is no harm, it is intended from this that, that the fee is a complete medicine in paying the harmony, not that it is that it is that They run one course, so that is what is meant by this words that are exaggerated in the form of the pilgrimage, disbelieving for all sins, not that the sacrifice, and the one who has been blessed, On the costume of the pilgrimage, a strong reason for the atonement of sins, his saying to him, peace and blessings be upon him: His mother.Fifth: that many of the scholars said: The neighborhood is a perpetrator, because if he turns the sanctuary and the house will fall from his eyes, and if he is cloudy, he will be clouded, and if he is more like him It is dangerous in this sense of this meaning that whoever hurry up on two days, then he is better than those who did not hurry, so he has seen the shrine in the place The cause remains in the risk that the urgent is the best of the late mother?So God has shown that there is no sin or embarrassment in one of them.وسادِسُها: قالَ الواحِدِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللَّهُ تَعالى: إنَّما قالَ: ومَن تَأخَّرَ فَلا إثْمَ عَلَيْهِ لِتَكُونَ اللَّفْظَةُ الأُولى مُوافِقَةً لِلثّانِيَةِ, كَقَوْلِهِ: وجَزاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ Likewise [Al -Shura: 40] and his saying: Whoever is accustomed to you, then be accustomed to him with the same as what you have accustomed to you [Al -Baqarah: 194] and we know that the reward of the Not a condemnation, if he is borne on the agreement of what is not valid in the sense, because he is carried on the agreement of the memorizer what is correct in the meaning of the first; Because the bitter paid is valid in the sense of the denial of the ingredient of it.The third question: Is it in the verse a sign of residence with the time after the overflowing of the cliff?.The answer: Yes, as it was in his saying: If you are from the norms [the cow: 198] is an indication of their eagerness to it.And he knew that jurisprudence said: It is permissible to hurry in the two days of those who hurry before the sunsets from the two days, but if the one is absent from the sun [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try
