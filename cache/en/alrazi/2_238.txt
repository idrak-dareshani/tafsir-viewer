The Qur’anic researcher is the sixth of the ruling of the preservatives of the prayers and the simple prayer, keep the prayers and the simple prayer, and do for God, the words of God: And the simple prayer and the people of God, I know that he was glorified and exalted when he explained to the costs of what he has shown from the meaning of his religion That is in the preservatives of the prayers, and that is for its wings: one of them: that the prayer is for its readings, righteousness, rak'ahs, prostration, subjugation, and righteousness, and the righteousness is beneficial, The disappearance of the resurrection of the printing, and the acquisition of the purposes of the orders of God Almighty, and the end of his endowments, as he said: The prayer is forbidden from Al -Fu'bism and Al -Maknah: [45] The second: that prayer reminds the servant of the majesty of the raptula and the humiliation of the servants and the command of reward and punishment, then then he will be upon him the sake of the sake of the sake of God Seek patience and prayer [Al -Baqara: 45].The third: that everything that was presented from the two marriage, divorce, and enemy, is a preoccupation with the reconciliation of the world, so that the remembrance of the prayer that is the interest of the last * is followed by * * The first question: The Muslims gathered on the fact that the prayer is five, and this is the verse that we are interpreting it indicates that; Because his saying: keep the prayers indicate the three from where the least of the gathering is three, then if its saying is up to the Almighty: and the ritual prayer is shown on the authority of the three of the three Repeating, and the origin is its numbers, and then that is the good, it is forbidden to be four, otherwise it will not have a simple For the whole and a simplicity, and that is less than five, for this verse is indicative of the camels of the fifth prayers with this way, and I know that this is the one who is so What is meant by the mediator is what is medieval in the number, not what is simplicity in the causes of guidance, and we explain that with evidence that God wills, except that this is the same Fifth prayers, but they do not indicate their duties, and the verses indicating the separation of the fourths are four: the first verse: His saying: the grace of God, when you are [Al -Rum: 17] This is the verse of the verses of the verse, so he said: (Glory be to God), meaning: Glory be to God, with him, pray to God, when you seek the prayer.(P-125) (When you become), he wanted to pray the morning (and live), he wanted the prayer of the era (and when you appear) the appearance of the noon.The second verse: His saying: The prayer of the prayer for the sun of the sun to the heapon of night [Al -Asra: 78] And dinner, then he said: (Stay Prayer) wanted to pray the morning.The third verse: His saying: He praised the praise of your Lord before the sun was brought up and before its sunset, and from the night of the night, he praised the day of the day: The verse indicates the five prayers; Because time is either before the sun or before its sects, then the night and the day are inside in these two memorials.The righteous verse: His Excellency said: The prayer of the day is the day of the day and the tallery of the night [Hood: 114] so what is meant by the two parties of the day: the morning, the one who says: Wester and dinner, and some of them touched him in the window of the tire; Because it was not a whole, the least of the three.* * * The second question: Know that the matter is preserved on the prayer, an order to preserve all its parties, meaning the purity of the body, the wicked, the place, the place, the place, and the place, The ritual, the kissing, and the preservation of all the places of prayer, and the preservatives of the exclusion from all the heroes of the prayer, whether it was from the hearts of the hearts, One of the works of the wounds, and the most important things in the prayer is the pursuit of the intention; It is the original intended from the prayer.If it was said: the preservation is only between two, such as the quarrel, and the fighting, how is the meaning here?And the answer is from two faces: one of them: that this preservative is between the servant and the Lord, as if it was said to him: keep the prayer to keep you with the prayer Like his saying: So remember me.The second: that the preservation is between the prayer and the prayer, as if it was said: “keep the prayer until the prayer preserves you, and knows that the prayer of the prayer is three or the prayer of the prayer of the prayer The first: that prayer keeps it from the sins, the Almighty said: The prayer is forbidden from immunity and denunciation [Al -Anakbout: 45] So whoever preserves the prayer is the one who preserves the prayer.The second: that the prayer preserves it from the misfortunes and the humiliation, he said: Taken: and seek patience and prayer [Al -Baqarah: 153] and he said: God said that I will not pray [Al -Ma’idah: 12] It is meaning: I am with you with support and memorization if you do the prayer and the zakat comes.And the third: that prayer keeps its owner and intercedes for its prayers.And because the prayer is in it, and the Qur’an intercede for its readers, and it is an intercessor.Also in the news: “The king of the king The slander of the slander is about the torment of the grave, and it will be argued by it in the wasting, and it stands in the path with his feet and says to the fire: there is no way for you.* * * The third question: they disagreed in the simple prayer on the seventh of the doctrine: the first saying: that God Almighty commanded the preservation of it, and it is not for it, and he did not We said: He did not show (P-126) because he had shown that he was either said: It is the Almighty to show it with a cut off, or with a way of thought; Because it is either that it is in this verse, or with another way of a resident, or a frequent news, and it is not possible to be the Bayan who has this verse; Because the number of prayers is five, and it is not in the verse a male for the first and the last of it, and if it is also possible in every one of these prayers, it is said that it is: Another verse or in a frequent news, and that is the inconsistency, and his emancipation is by the thoughtful way, which is the news of the one and the measurement, so it is not permissible; Because the beneficial method of thinking is considered in the operations, and this question is not like that, so you have proven that God is the Almighty, and he did not show that the prayer is the one who said: It is up to what he summarized with the more confirmation, with the exalted, and the woman has not shown it in every prayer that it performs that it is the mediator, and it becomes a reason for the performance of all of you.And the completion, and this reason is hidden by God, the night of the destiny in Ramadan, and I hide the hour of answering on the day The cost is a disagreement from the death in all the hamats, so it will come with repentance in all the halls, and this saying is selected by a group of scholars.Muhammad ibn Sirin said: A man asked Zayd ibn Thabet about the simple prayer, and he said: He preserved all the prayers.On the authority of the Rabi` ibn Khayqam, he asked him one of them, and he said: O cousin, the mediator is one of them, so he kept all the preservatives of the one.Then the rabbi said: If you taught her with her eyes, you would have been preserved for her and a burden for their captives.The questioner said: No.Al -Raba’i said: If you preserved them, then you have preserved the mediator.The second saying: It is the group of five prayers; This is because this fifth is the mediator of obedience, and its report is that faith is a few seventy parties The associate without faith and above the pattern of harm, it is a median between the two parties.The third saying: It is the prayer of the morning, and this is the saying of the companions.The two followers say that is a bid, and a tender, Akrama and a jurist, and he is the gold of the companion, may God have mercy on him, and who indicates the health of this saying: The first: the first: that this prayer is prayed in the Darkness, so the night prayer was like, and the last of it falls into the light, so the day of the day was like.The second: That this prayer leads after the inhabitants of the morning, and before the sun was broken, and this is the amount of time, the darkness is not in it complete, and it is not complete, and it is not complete.It is not a night or a day, for it is a mediator between them.The third: It was obtained in the day, two prayers: the noon and the era, and in the night two prayers: the strange and the dinner, and the prayer of the morning is like the one between the two prayers.If it was said: This suffering is made in the prayer of the Maghreb.Come here.The quarter: that the noon and the era are gathered with a defense with the agreement, and in the travel at the Shafi’i, as well as the Maghreb and the dinner, and as for the prayer of the dawn, it is the one who is alienated, and it will be in the place The noon and the era are one time, and I have come to the strange and dinner, and I have come to the dawn, the one between them.They say: So -and -so, if he did not bored one of the two characteristics, then it was alienated with themselves from them, and God knows.Fifth: His Excellency said: The Qur’an was a martyrdom [Al-Asra: 78] (P-127), and it was proven with the frequency that what is meant by the prayer of the dawn is, but it was made of it, but it was made.In the presence of the angels of the night and the angels of the day.If you know this, then he faces the recipient of this verse from two sides: one of them: that God Almighty has turned out to the prayer of the dawn with the remembrance, so this is the same, so it is a good.He singled out the simple prayer with more affirmation, and he will be overwhelmed by the thought that the prayer of the dawn is when it was proven that it is better in that verse, and it is necessary to be the one who will be This verse.The second: The angels are punished with night and night, so the nights of the night and the angels of the day are gathered in one time, except for the prayer of the dawn, so the prayer of the dawn, then it is the prayer of the prayer With the night of the night and the day from this direction, it was like a medium.The sixth: that he said after the remembrance of the simple prayer: and protect God for the two centuries of this prayer with the remembrance of the channel, and there is no prayer in the ritual.In it except for the morning, it indicates that what is meant by the simple prayer is the prayer of the morning.The seven: There is no doubt that it is exalted, but it turned it into a remembrance for the sake of confirmation, and there is no doubt that the prayer of the morning is the argument of prayers to confirmation; It is not more difficult in prayer than it; Because it responds to people in the most delicious duties The sleep, until the Arabs were called the sleep of the horse of the pleasure of the pleasure, and there is no doubt that the blessed sleep is left in that time in that time, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, To the mosque and the grace of the heavy prayer that is difficult for the soul, so it is obligatory to be the intended of the simple prayer; It is the most severe of the prayers that need to be sure.The eighth: that the prayer of the morning is the best of the prayers, and if it is, then it is necessary to be what is meant by the simple prayer, the prayer of the morning, but we said: It is the best of the prayers: His Excellency said: The patient and those who are honest to his words are exalted: and those who seek forgiveness with magic As they are forgiven by magic, then the greatest types of exploitation must be the performance of the supply; To him, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him for his Lord Almighty: ““ He will not come close to me, who are close to me, such as the performance of what I have assumed to them.” Faith is the prayer of the morning.And the second: What was narrated in it is that the first pride of it with the group is better than the world and what is in it.And the third of it: that it has been established with the correct news that the prayer of the morning is specialized in the ears two times: once before the dawn of the dawn, and the same time;
