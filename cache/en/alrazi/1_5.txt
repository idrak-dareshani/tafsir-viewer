The fifth separation researcher in the interpretation of his saying, “We worship you and you, we seek help, and in it the first good things: worship is a phrase for the verb of the verb of the one The greatness of others, and it is taken from their saying: a worshiper is a servant, that is, a humiliating, and I know that your saying is that we worship it with no one who worshiped you, Wahwah: The first: that worship is a phrase for the end of the majestic, and it is only suitable for those who have been issued by the end of the year, and the greed of the face of the life that is the one who is the one And the one who benefits from it, the first arrangement - is the life that benefits the place of the integrity - and the signal is the Almighty saying: I have created you and did not.And his saying: How do you disbelieve in God and you are a honest, so I will give you the verse [Al -Baqarah: 28] and the second arrangement - and it is the creation of the one who wages with it - He created for you what is in all the earth [Al -Baqarah: 29] And when the reconciliation has occurred in this lower world, but it continues with the royal movements on the path With his saying: Then he went to the sky, so they settled seven heavens, and he is with everything knowledge Worship is good except for God Almighty, for this meaning said to you, we worship, because his saying is that we worship you.The second face: In the evidence of this confinement and the concerns: that is because it is the highest named its soul is here with five names: God, the Lord, the Most Merciful, and the Most Merciful, and the Most Merciful.The servant has three conditions: the past, the present and the future; As for the past, it was a sense of urbanization as he said: I was created before and you did not have anything.Mother, so I will give you [Al-Baqarah: 28] and it was ignorant, so God taught him as (P-197) said: And God has brought you out of the stomachs of your mothers.And the servant is transmitted from the numbers to the existence and from the death to life, and from the reward to the ability and from the ignorance to the knowledge, for the sake of the sake of God, the exalted, the righteousness of the one, for the sake of God, And his eternal knowledge made it up and transmitted it from the numbers to the existence, so it is a god for this meaning, and the present situation of the servant, his argument is a hardship, because it is a word that was not a word that was not The Most Merciful, but when he entered the faces, the gates of the needs were opened to him and the causes of the warnings were brought to him, so God Almighty said: Wooding.As for after you had become a struggle, your needs have many have been The future of the servant is the same as after the dead and the attached to the case of this situation is the saying of “the money of the day of religion”, so this is the righteousness Considering this three conditions of the servant, it appeared that all the interests of the servant in the past and the present and the future are not fulfilled and did not take care of it, but it is not, and it is not.The matter is like that, the servant does not occupy the worship of something except with the worship of God Almighty, so the servant said: “We are worshiped and you are helping.” The third face: in the indication of this limitation, which is that the indicators have indicated the seer on the royalty of his place, the highest, a good, a good, generous, honest, and beautiful horses.Likewise, you have suspicion of it; Because there is no effect that is added to the pride, the ark, the maker, the mind, and the soul, except that its addition to the capacity of God is exalted, and with this involvement, then the affiliation has become.The knowledge is that God is up to the worshipers of creation is a matter of time By doubt, the suspicion is required and the information is taken, and on this, there are no worshipers except God Almighty.The fourth face: that the servitude is humiliation and humiliation, except that the more honorable and the highest, the worshipers were with him His servants were more than Abboudism other than him, and also the destiny of God is higher than the ability of others, and his knowledge is more complete than his knowledge, and the best of his goodness, The piece was obligated that his servants are first of his servants other than him.Fifth face: that all that is due to itself is possible for its own self and everything that was possible for itself was a poor and the needy, and the need is busy with the authority The payment of the need for others, and the thing was not in itself, and the payment of the pilgrim was unable to pay for others The worship is God Almighty, for this reason, he said to you, we worship and you seek help.The sixth direction: the right of worship is called the capacity of God, to hold a sky without a relationship, and the land without a dumper, and the sun, and the sun, The clouds are removed from the fire, which is lightning, and the air is the wind, which is the wind, and the water is water, which is the rain, and in the land, it is removed from the waters from the stone, which is a phenomenon, and a watered from the waters, Then he made in the land a valuable bodies that are not traveling, which are the mountains; And a bodies are an unimaginable traveling, and they were lost, and they were made.The earth is on the authority of it, and he raised Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.Repeated and peace be upon Abraham, and lifted Moses at the phase, and he said to him, “Come on to you,” and raised the phase on Moses and his people, and we raised them with the time of the woman (154) The world is from the enlightenment of Japanese for his saying: The enlightening of the enlightenment [Hood: 40] and made the sea dressed for peace be upon him, so whoever is his ability to do so, how is it like this.And among other things, plants, animal, or astronomer, or king, or the king, then the settlement between the deficiency, the full, the zeal and the preciousness indicates the ignorance.The second one: His saying: We do not worship you that there is no worshiper except God, and when the matter was like that, you have proven that there is no god but God, and he said: We seek to indicate the cure.He knew that the participants are as long as it is, and that is because everyone who takes a partner to God, then this is the partner of either that it is a body, or that it will not be, either, either.Jasmmani, then those who are the parties are either from the lower bodies or from the upper bodies.As for those who took the partners from the bilingual bodies, then the gesture is that Poisoned or shed, but the compound is that it is from the hostility, or from the plant, or from the animal, or from the human being, but those who took the partners from the bodies of the people, then the bodies are from They take idols, either from the stones, from gold, or from silver, and worship them, and those who took the partners from the plants, they are the ones who are the ones who took the ones who took the ones.Surprisingly for themselves, and those who took the partners from the animal, they are those who took the wheel to the servants of themselves, for those who take them, but those who take them.The people are the ones who said: The son of the son of God, and the Christ of God, and those who took the partners from the bodies, are those who are the ones who worshiped Those who took the partners from the upper bodies, they are the ones who worship the sun, the moon, and the brochures The two stars, but those who took the partners of God from other than the bodies, also understood the kindness: the first sect: those who said: the mastermind of the world is the light, the light is the light, the light is the light, Manuet and Entony.And the second sect: they are those who said: The angel is a phrase for the kingdoms, and for every bone of the spirit in particular from the kingdoms, it is the same This world is a spirit, so it is a man who is mobilized, and takes it to you The signs are images and furniture and worship them, and these are the servants of the angels.And the third sect: those who said to the world to the most important: one of them is better, and the other is evil, and they said: The mastermind of this world is God Almighty and Abis, who are the brothers From God, and everything in it is evil, it is from Episys.If you know this conquest, then say: Everyone who takes to God is a partner, then it is imperative that it be presented to the worship of that partner from some of the wives; Either asking for his benefit or an escape from its harm, but those who were raised on the neutrality and the saying of the partner and the plots, and they did not worship except God, and they did not worship So their hope was from God, their fear of God, and their desire in God and their intimidation from God, so it is not a crime, and they did not worship except God and they did not seek help from God.If this is what we worshiped, and you seek help from you, so his saying was that we worship you and you seek help from the standing of his saying, but God.And know that the famous remembrance is that you say the grace of God and praise be to God and no god but God Praise be to God, in which the meaning of our saying is entered by God, because His saying is the grace of God, it is completely completely shown in his soul, and he said to him A complement to others, and the thing is not a complement to be completed for others unless it was completely before that complete Our saying (P-199) is the grace of God, and when the praise said to God, all the types of praise were proven to mention what is running the course of the cause to prove all the types of praise With the fifth lines, which are for the sake of the sake of the servant in the three times, on what he has shown, and when this is clear, the authenticity of our saying is the same.After that, he said to you, we worship you, and we have indicated that he is a standing standing, there is no god but God, and then he mentioned his saying, and we will see you, It is intended from the purposes and the supplies of purposes, except with its insistence, success, and charity, and this is what is meant by our saying, and there is no power, and the power of God, The surah of Al -Fatihah is from the first to the end of it, which is applied to that remembrance, and the verses of these surahs are a neighbor of the explanation and detail of the male, the male.The third is the third: He said to you, we worship you, so he said to you on his saying, and we did not say that we worship you Suffering it to pay attention to the game that the idol is the truth North; It is narrated that one of the wicked widespreads were seized, so he made the angi of that the professor, so it was said to the anchor: that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the case, Except for his sacrifice from him, so we are: He defined himself first until the worship will be with the crowd, so do not mix with the negligence.And secondly: If obedience is lost to you and the worship is difficult for you from the rise, the kneeling, and the prostration, then mention the first saying to you, we worship you, and you will be done.My knowledge, if you mentioned my majesty, my greatness, my pride, and I know that I am your money, and that you are your servants, I will make it easy for you to those worship, and the example is that whoever wants to make Before that, he increases his strength and intensity, for the servant when he wanted to hold the hard -and -stricken crocodile إيّاكَ حَتّى يَقْوى عَلى حَمْلِ ثِقَلِ العُبُودِيَّةِ, ومِثالٌ آخَرُ وهو أنَّ العاشِقَ الَّذِي يُضْرَبُ لِأجْلِ مَعْشُوقِهِ في حَضْرَةِ مَعْشُوقِهِ يَسْهُلُ عَلَيْهِ ذَلِكَ الضَّرْبُ, So, so: if he witnesses the beauty of you, he will be easy for him to burn the servitude of the servants.And the third of it: God Almighty said: Those who fear if they touched a group of Satan, remember, then if they are insightful [Al -A'raf: 201], then the soul, if it is touched by a sect of the one who is from the one who is a sect of the slave of the And the chapter remembers the presence of the majesty of God from the honor of his saying, “We worship you, and they will see the visionary, who are prepared to perform worship and obstacles.And the one who is upset: If you say we worship you, then you start first with the remembrance of the servants of your soul and you did not remember that that worship for whom, then he is to be able For idols, for the bodies, or for the sun, or the moon, but if you changed this trait and you first said to you, then you said secondly, we worship you, and you will say that you are the first of you.And the idol is God Almighty, so this was the most exaggerated in the neutrality and the most from the involvement of the evil.Fifth: It is that the obligation that is required for itself is advanced in the existence of the modern speaker for itself, so its remembrance must be presented to all of the dhikr; For this reason, he said to you on his saying, we worship so that the remembrance of the truth is presented to the remembrance of creation.And its sixth: Some of the investigators said: Whoever looked at the time of the blessing to the blessing, not to the grace, his looked at the time of the bastard to the abhorrent, not to the calamity, and the abuse of The circumstances in the knowledge of the truth are their grace, and everyone who was like that was eternal in the highest paths of happiness, but whoever his view at the time of the grace to the grace is not to the grace of the bless Balal, not to the mortal, so it was a fine in all the harassment in the work without God, and it was ever in the Shaqwa, because at the time of the birth of the grace it will be He was disobedient of its disappearance, and it was in torment, and at the time of the death of the blessing was wrapped in the treasury and the corrupt, so it was in the core of the peace and the angels, and for this investigation, he said to the mother of Moses: My blessing, and he said to the nation of Muhammad, peace be upon him: Remember me, I remember you, (P-200) If you know this, then say: He said: He said to you.Exclusively in the scene of the light of the majesty of you, and when the matter was like that, it was at the time of the performance of worship stable in the eyes of the paradise, as he said: With the nose until I love it, then if I love him, I was heard and visible.And the sake of it: If it was said that we will worship you, their worshipers have not been exhausted for others, because there is no reason to worship God and worship, and they worship, and they are worshiped.When we worship you, he stated that they worship him and do not worship God.And the eighth: that this noun is the noun of the bone, as if it was said to him when you were outside the prayer, so do not say, and if you were in a thousand thousand And the servants appeared to us, saying, "We worship to appear to everyone that everyone who worshiped us was the king of the world and the last." And the ninth: If he said to you, I will be worshiped, and that I am older and meaning that I am a game, but when he said to you, we worship it, it was with me that I am one of your servants, and the first is the first, and the first is the first, and the first And whoever puts to God, may God raise him, and whoever grows up, God puts him.If he said: All of what you mentioned is a standing in the words of praise to God with it that he presented in it the remembrance of praise on the remembrance of God.The answer is that his saying of praise is to be to be for God and the other of God, so if you say to God, then you will restrict the praise that he will be for God, but God is.He began to be for God and be able to be for the other hand, and that is an infidel; And the joke is that the praise is when it is permissible for the other one to appear, as it is permissible for God, there is no crime that is good.His saying to you is worshiped, so the way of worship is appointed to worship, so there is no involvement in the words that worship fall for the other.The fourth is the one: for a saying that he says: Nun in his saying, we worship either that you will be the gathering of the gathering or the noun of glorification, and the first is false; Because the single person is not a collection, and the second is invalid, because the performance of worship is the one who is the one who is a person who is a person to remember himself with miracle, humiliation.And know that it is possible to answer it from the faces, every one of those faces indicates a ruling on the language: the first face is that the one who wants to do this The first person is to perform the prayer in the group, and know that the benefit of prayer in the group is known And upon him, peace be upon him, indicates: “The first pride in the prayer of the group is better than the world and what is in it.The group is attended, lest a human being hurt from it, as if he is the Almighty saying: This obedience to which this great reward is not fulfilled by the reward that the reward is not fulfilled With the openings of garlic and the connection, if this reward is not fulfilled by that, how is it possible to harm the Muslim, and how does it fulfill the name, the absence and the endeavor.The second face: that if a man is praying with the group, then he says we worship, and it is intended from that gathering, and if he prayed and alone, it is intended that I worship you.So what is meant by his saying is that he worshiped, and all the angels who worship God.The third face: that the believers are a brother, and if he said, I will worship you, he had mentioned the worship of himself, and he did not remember the worship He mentioned the worship of himself and the worship of all the believers, with the east and west, as if he was seeking to give the tasks of the believers of the believers, and if he did that, he will make him judge.Peace be upon him: “He who has spent a Muslim who has a need, may God have all his needs.” (p-201) The Fast face: as if he said to the servant, when you have given us the praise of the praise of God, the Lord of the two worlds, the Merciful, the Money The one who is the world and the hereafter has lost your destiny with us and your home was able to do our presence, so do not confine to your task, and your inspiration is, and for you All the Muslims, say: We are worshiped and you are sought.The fifth face: as if the servant says: I have not reached my worshipers to where I deserved to remember her and alone; Because it is mixed with the flaws of negligence, but I mix with it with all the worship of all the people, and I remember all with one dilemma and I say to you.And here is a partial question, which is that if a man sells one of him ten of the slaves, then Al -Mashtari is either accepting everyone, or he does not accept one of them, and he will not be in the authority That companion, so if the servant says, we worship you, so he has been presented to the presence of God, all the worshipers of the games, so he does not fulfill his generosity that he is distinguished And one accepts without some, but it is returned and it is not permissible, because his saying is that we worship in which the worshipers of the angels and the worshipers, and the worshipers, and the worship He accepts all, and then the worship of this is an acceptance of acceptance of the acceptance of the virginity of the worship An acceptance, so do not return me because I am not alone in this worship, but we are many.To you with the worshipers of the servants of the worshipers, then answer me.Fifth Fifth: Know that whoever knows the servants of worship, he would have to work with it; He was less than that, and his two sides: the first: that the kinship is loved by the self, and the fullness of the conditions of the human being and its strength is in its place, and it is the same as it.His heart is enlightened by the divine light, and he honored his tongue with the honor of remembrance and readings, and his members are completed with the generosity of the servants of God, and this is the honor of God.And the human trades, if the extent of these conditions is the greatest of humanity The heaviest of obedience was removed from it and its sweetness was great in his heart.The second: The worship is a safety with the same saying of the Almighty: We have provided safety on the venerable heavens [Al -Ahzab: 72] and the performance of safety and the obligation of a mind and a law, with the words of your saying: That the trusts lead to its people [Women: 58] and the performance of safety is a characteristic of the blasphemy with love with the same; Because the performance of safety from one of the two sides is a reason for performing safety from the second side, some companions said: I saw an Arab who came to the door of the mosque, and he came down from his veil and blessed it.With the cabinet and the continent, and called for what he wanted, so we liked us, and when he came out, he did not find his authenticity, and he said: God has done your safety, so where is my safety?Al -Rawi said, “We increased us, so he did not stay until a man came to his vertebrae, and his hand was cut off and the camel was delivered to him, and the disintegration is that he is not.His faithfulness, and he is what is meant by his saying, peace be upon him, by Ibn Abbas: “O boy, may God preserve God in the cells, keep you in the fabrics.” The third: that the work of worship is transferred from the world of virginity to the world of emblem, and from the preoccupation with creation to the urbanization of the right, and that is obligatory as the money and the pleasure.It is narrated from Abu Hanifa that a life was fell from the stance, and the people were separated, and Abu Hanifa was in prayer and did not feel it.The eaters fell in some members of the ibn al -Zubayr, and they needed to cut that member, and when he was prescribed in the prayer, they cut off that Cut.On the authority of the Messenger (P-202), God ﷺ was that when he was prescribed in the prayer, they would hear from his chest a privilege like the dear man, and whoever follows this, let him say: He saw him greater and cut their hands [Joseph: 31], because the women when they prevailed over their hearts.And what you feel with that, then if this is permissible in the right of humanity, then it is permissible at the wasting of the greatness of God on the heart of the heart, and because whoever enters the Lord of his Lord, he will be in the heart And his sons, while looking at them, and not knowing them for the sake of the sake of the meal of that, the heart prevents the feeling of them.The right of the world is the first.Then the people of the investigation said: The worship has three degrees: the first degree: that God worships in the reward or an escape from the punishment, and this is the name of the servant, and this is the name A very dropping down; Because his idol in the truth is that reward, and he has made the right and a means to the wealth of the one who is required, and whoever has made the one who has the same thing is something of the truth and made the truth and made the right to the right It is a very vicious.The second study: that God worships for the sake of honoring His worshipers, or he is honored with the acceptance of his costs, or he will be honored, and he will be honored, and he will be honored, From the first; However, it is also not complete; Because what is meant by the self is other than God.The third time: that God be worshiped for his creation and creative, and for him to be a servant for Him, and divine requires hippo and pride, and the servants, and the servitude, and the servitude, The highest and honorable deals, this is the name of the slave, and the signal is the saying of the prayer in the first prayer: the origin of God; So if he said my origin for the reward of God, or for the sacrifice of his punishment; His prayers were spoiled.He knows that worship and worshipers are a highlighted position, and it indicates verses: the first: the words of the exalted in the last wall of the stone: and we know that you are the one who makes you narrow So praise the praise of your Lord, be among the prostitutes, and worship your Lord until the righteous will come Al -Yakin, so he commanded Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, with worship on worship until the death comes to him, and it is meaning that it is not permissible for the brothers to worship in something The majesty of the worship of worship.And secondly: He said: We know that you are narrowing your chest with what they say; Then he is up to him with four things: praise: and it is his saying, praise; And Tahdid: It is his saying: with the praise of your Lord; And the prostration: It is his saying: It was one of the prostitutes; And worship: It is his saying: and worship your Lord until the two people come to you; This indicates that worship removes the narrowness of the heart, and it benefits the expulsion of the chest, and that is only because worship requires the return from creation to the truth, and that is the same.The second verse in the honor of Abboudia: His Exalted: Glory be to whom he caused to his servants at night [Al -Israa: 1] and if only the servants are the honor of the maqam الصِّفَةِ في أعْلى مَقاماتِ المِعْراجِ, ومِنهم مَن قالَ: العُبُودِيَّةُ أشْرَفُ مِنَ الرِّسالَةِ; Because in the slave, it is dispersed from creation to the truth, and by the abandonment he behaves From the right to creation, and also in the causes of worshipers, it is removed from the fragments, and in the causes of the message, it is accepted by the honesty, and the righteousness of the servant, Also the servant sponsors the mourners with the interests of his tasks, and the Messenger is the sponsorship of the nation’s tasks, and the scaling of what is between them.(P-203) The third verse in the honor of the servants: that Jesus is the first thing that he uttered.He was exerted from the stabbing, and it became a key to all the goods, and he was driven for all pests, and also when the first words of Jesus were the remembrance of the servants, it was the one who said: And he brought you up to me [Al -Imran: 55], and the joke is that the one who claimed the servants of the saying was raised to Heaven, and who claims it to work seventy years; How does he remains free from paradise?.The righteous verse: His Exalted, peace be upon him, said: I am God, there is no god but I, and I worship me [Taha: 14] He commanded him after the slander of the slave; Because the neutrality is origin, the slave is a firm, and the neutrality is a tree, and the slave is a fruit, and there is no bond for one of them except by the other, so these verses are indicative.As for the reasonable, it is a back.That is because the servant is an event that is able to exist for itself, and if not the effect of the truth in which the rest is in the darkness of the numbers and in the death of the death and the death of the death and the death of the death and the death of the death, and the death of the one who did not As the existence of the existence, when the ability of the right to it was attached to it, and the effects of its presence and its creation were overwhelmed by the existence of the existence and the stretches of the existence, and there is no meaning to the one The truth, and its formation is related to finding the truth except the slave, for every honor, a blasphemy, a glow, a grade, a tradition, and a veil that was obtained for the servant, but it was done Al -Aboudiya, so it was proven that the servants are the conquest of goodness, the title of the happiness, and the recovery of the pads, and the rituals of the knees, for this reason, the servant said: We seek help, and he was the most honorable of God and his face saying: I suffice for me to be a slave to you, and it is enough for me to be honored to be for me, O God Abda as you wanted.Sixth: I know that the maqamah is counted in two shrines: the knowledge of the profile and the knowledge of the servants, and when their meeting is in the era of His saying: And fulfill my covenant, and I will fulfill your covenant [Al -Baqarah: 40] As for the knowledge of the grapes, its entry into it is mentioned in its saying: the praise of the Lord of the Lord, the Lord of the Lord Religion is the formation of the servant, who is transmitted from the preceding numbers to the existence, indicating his place of God, and the fact that the good and the goods will be obtained for the servant if it is his existence.Merciful, merciful, and the conditions of the worship of the servant, indicate that it is your money on the Day of Religion, and when surrounding With these attributes, the custom of the grapes came to the maximum ends, and after that the knowledge of the slave came, and it has a principle, a full, the first and the first, and the first, and the first, and the first, and the first, and the first of it, Exaggeration with slaves, and it is what is meant by his saying: You are worshiped, and as for its fullness, it is that the servant knows that there is no way for the disobedience God is only the success of God, for that he can help God in obtaining all the demands, and that is what is meant by his saying: and for you to seek help And with the covenant of the servants, he arranged for him to seek the good and the fruit, and it is his saying: We guided the straight path, and this is a high -minded, high -minded, high -minded in the mind.Another premiere from it.The one who is the one who is the one who says: “The praise of the Lord of God, the Lord of the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.We worship and you seek a resignation from the memorization of the absence to the memorization of the speech, so what is the benefit is in it?We said: There are faces in it: The first: that the prayer was foreigners with the hurry in prayer As if he said to him, I have been praised for him and decided to make me a god with mercy (P-204) money to the Day of Religion, so the servant blessed us, and we have lifted us With the closeness, you speak to the addressee and say to you.The second face: The best question is what was signed on the way of the healing, not to see that the Prophet, peace be upon them, when they asked their Lord, he saw him with the question, and they said: Our Lord, forgive us [Al -Hashr: 10], And the servant is in the first.The third face: that from the first surah to his saying, we worship a praise, and praise in the absence is first, and from his words, we worship you and you, and we will be happy.In attendance at first.The loyal face: the servant when he was granted in the prayer and said I intended to pray close to God, so he intended to obtain the kinship, then he mentioned after this God, so the generosity of God required his answer in the acquisition of that kinship, so he transferred it from the shrine of the absence to the position of presence, so he said: Do not worship you.* * * The sixth chapter in its saying and you seek help that I have been established with the mental evidence that there is no way about the disobedience of God God is only the fulfillment of God, and it is indicated by the faces of the mind and the transmission.It is able to do the action and leaving on the level, so what is not likely to obtain the most likely, the righteous, and that is the most likely to be from the servant, or the one who is from the servant, Excellency, she proves that the servant could not be attended by the verb except with the insistence of God.The second: that all the successors are asking the religion the right and the honesty with their equivalent in the ability, mind, grandfather and requesting, so the time of the sake is not With appointed insistence, and what is the one who is appointed except God Almighty, because that appointed if he was human or king, he would have returned to him.The third: that a person may ask for a period of time and does not come to him, and then in a case or a time when he comes to him and presents to him, and he does not agree with him, and he will not agree with him.His heart calls him to that action, for the meeting of that preacher in the heart and the removal of the reasons that are opposed to it is only from God Almighty, and there is no meaning to insistence.As for the transmission, there are verses on it: the first: its saying and you are helping.And secondly: His saying, seek help from God [Al -A'raf: 128], and the Jabriyah and Al -Qadriya were forced in this verse: As for the album The use of the verb had a dedication, and the estimation said that the use is that it was good, even if the servant was able to do the origin of the verb, then the one who is the one who is not.The verb was not appreciated, and the use of use was not.And when the ability does not affect the verb except with the assertive preacher, so the required insistence is a fee for the creation of the assertive preacher and the removal of the sacrifice.Let us remember what is in this word of the lengths and the benefits: the first good: for a saying to say: the use of work is only good before the work in the work.He said to you, we worship him, then he mentioned his mind and you seek help, so what is the rule is in it?The answer is from his faces: The first: As if the prayer is saying: I have been approved in
