The researcher of the Quranic, the righteous, is glorified and exalted: O people, they are not in the land, a good permissible, and do not follow the steps of the Satan.God is what you do not know.Know that it is up to the one who indicated the neutrality and its evidence, and what the renters of the reward and follow it with the remembrance of the evil and the one who takes from God, and the Lord, That is the remembrance of his enemies on the two parties and his charity to them, and that the disobedience of those who disobeyed him and the disbelief of those who disbelieved in it, and it did not affect the piece of it.Eat what is in the land in which it is: Aqifa, the sons of Amir bin Sa`sa, Khuza, and the sons of Mudlj.The second question: the permissible halal that has been the contract of the barrier from it, and its origin from the solution that is the essence of the contract, and from it: it is a solution if it comes to it.Because it is a solution to the adoption of the descent, and the debt is dissolved if it is necessary to decay the contract by spending the period, and it is permissible from its warning; Because it was the solution of the contract, and the wise one has been replaced by it; To confuse the contract with the obstacles of torment, and the solution of the vision and the sacrifice; Because it is permissible from the fold of confusion, and from this the resolve of the right; Because it is the contract of the right, it is permissible for it, and know that the forbidden may be a forbidden for its misfortune, such as the dead, blood and wine, and it may be a forbidden, not for the sake Its eaters, for the permissible is the empty of the Qadin.The third question: His saying is good, if you want to set it in the case of what is on the ground, and if you want it, it is an effective.The loyal question: The good in the language may be in the sense of the purified and the halal describing it as good; Because the forbidden is described as a heavy, the Almighty said: Say: The fabrication is not equal and the good [Al -Ma’idah: 100] and the good in the original is what is infected with it, and it is dedicated to it, The suspicion; Because the uncleanness is hated by the soul, so it does not enjoy it (P-4) and the forbidden is not the same; Because the law is imprisoned from it, and in what is meant by the good in the verse and Jahan: the first: that it is the delightful; Because if we had carried it on the permissible, the righteousness was necessary, so this is good if it is a race that is unhappy; Because if he does not have a desire for him, he returns in it, and if he is far from the sake of the sane person, only with suspicions.The second: What is permissible for him is permissible, and his saying is necessary for us.It is related to the right It becomes harmful and not be rectified, as he said: The people who eat the money of orphans are injustice, but they eat in their stomachs a fire [Women: 10].* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Do not follow the steps of the Satan, in it in the books: the first question: the son of the son of Amir and Al -Kisa’i, and it is one of the narrators on the authority of the son Asim (lines) by the guarantee of the khula and the lord, and those who are in the cousin of the Ta'a, but for those who destroy the eye, because the one is a step, then if you collect the eyes of the eye, then the eyes of the eye, so that it is the same On this wealth, we are a place of room and rooms, and the eye is free to the group as it was done in this way of this gathering for the separation between the name and the name of the name, and that is the name of the name and the name of the name, By investigating the eye, we are the same as a time, a dates, a lord, a lust, a lust and a lust, and what was called a gathering with the eyes of the eye, the signs of the huge, the huge, and the abuse, and the absence The names are not from the adjectives, so it will be combined with the sacrifice of the eye.The second question: Ibn al -Sakat said when it was narrated by al -Juba’i al -Khatwa and the sin in one meaning, and it was narrated from the deceased: I did not go to the ritual As it is said: I got a hurricane, and the ritual is a name for what you urged, and so I have scattered a scandal and the sunset is a name for what I was unknown, and if it was like that, then the sin is so.That the sunset is the thing that is defined by the palm, so the meaning is: Do not follow its path and do not shed its way; Because the step is the name of a place, and this is the saying of the gospel and the son of Qatibah, then they said: The steps of the Satan are its ways, and if you made the steps with the meaning of the man The estimation: do not take care of it and do not stop its impact, and the meanings are close, even if the two people are different.This is what is related to the language, and the meaning is not the intention of God.To what the Satan calls you, and the assignment of this talk about the words of the permissible to the suspicion, as it removes it from his skipping it to the forbidden; Because the Satan is throwing into a woman what runs the sequence of the suspicion, and it is decorated with that of what is not permissible for him, so God Almighty is exalted from that, then he is in this It is an enemy, which is angry, that is, angry with hostility.That is because the Satan is seven in the hostility; Four of them in his words, the Almighty: and for them to be lost, and they will give them to them, and they command them, so let the ears of the ears will be in the ears of the ears, and they will be commanded, so they will be changed from the woman: His Exalted, Him: For the sake of your straight path, then we will come to them among themselves and from their successors, and for their faith, and they will not be blessed with them [Al -A'raf: 16, 17] So The System of these matters was an enemy that is angry with hostility, for this, God has attributed it to this.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: He commands you to worsen and in obstruction, and that you say to God what you do not know, so this is like detailing for the sentence of the enemy, which is the ritual of the ritual The first: the bad, and it is a variable of all sins, whether they (P-5) sins from the actions of the wounds or from the actions of the hearts.And the second: Al -Fu'miyyah, which is a type of bad; Because it is the ugliness of its types, and it is the one who is glorified and exhausted from the ticks.And the third: And to say to God what you do not know, as if it is the ugliness of the types of periulture; Because he described God Almighty with what does not want to be the greatest kinds of kindness, so this sentence has become like an interpretation of his saying: Do not follow the lines of the sins.The Satan calls for the listeners, the brightness, the infidels, and the ignorance of God.Here are the questions: The first question: Know that the matter of Satan and his whispers are a phrase of these devices that we find from our souls, and the people have disappeared in this From his faces: one of them: they disagreed with what they are, and some of them said: They are letters and hidden voices, and the philosopher said: It is the perceptions of the forefathers, voices, and the imagination of the loudests.The one in the mirrors, for those pictures resemble those things from some faces, and if they are not similar to all the faces.And it is a saying to say: The pictures of these letters and their imagination do these forefathers liken it in their void or not like it?If the first is the rituals of the forefathers, then the saying returned to the fact that these ruins are voices and hidden votes, and if the second is not the ways of these voices, these are the ways But I find out of myself, these forests and the voices are raised, in accordance with their system in the out of the outside, and the Arabic does not speak in his heart, and only in the heart of the Arab And the perceptions of these letters and their punishment and their succession are only on the soil of their punishment and their succession in the outside, so she proves that it is in its own forever and hidden.And the second: that the actor of these maids who is?As for our origin, which is that the creator of the journeys with their families is God Almighty, the matter is back, and at the origin of the dispersed, they do not say that, and also because of the one who is the one.The words, if if the perpetrator of these maids were God, the Exalted, and in it what would be false and disgraceful, the universe of God is obligatory for you The actor is the servant; Because the servant may hate those of those devices, and to pay off them from his soul with it with the time that it does not drive, but rather the bone of the bone So we must have something other In the maximum brain, and in the maximum hearts, even if a person is in the end of the level, then he hears this forefathers and voices, then if we say that the Satan and the angels are the same The bias of the bit, and it did not exceed the same as it is possible for such actions, and if we say that it is a gentle bodies, it is not the same as it is that it is not that it is not.The Hutan Al -Bashir is involved, except that they are able to communicate this speech to the Hutan of the human, and not also it is said: It is a purpose of its kindness in the ritual The inner of the human beings and the mockery of its body and the words reach the maximum heart and brain, then with its sins, it will be the control of the installation, with the sake With some, a connection is not separated, so there is no crime that does not require its influence in this harm and the burning of its separation and separate its parts.And all of these are the norms of what is not indicative of its corruption, and the matter in the knowledge of its facts is upon God Almighty.And what indicates the evidence of the angels of the angels is the saying of the Almighty: as your Lord suggests to the angels that I am with you, so I have proven those who believed in [Al -Anfal: 12] On their enemies.It indicates from him the news, his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: He made a Satan with him and God has a king with a king, for the Satan is cursed on the ears of his easiest heart, and the king is crouching on the ears of his heart.The Sufism of the Bassa of the one who interpreted the king who called for the good power of the mind, and the (P-6) was called the call to evil with the power of the Shahwah.* * * The second question: the verse indicated that the Satan is only commanded by the fool; Because it is the Almighty, he mentioned it with a word, but it is for the confinement.And some of those who know: The Satan has called for good, but it is for the sake of his abundance from it to evil, and that is indicated by types: either that he will go from the best It comes out from the virtuous to evil, or that it is broken from the most difficult to the most difficult preference to become the increase in the hardships because of the incidence of the bond of obedience.The third question: His Excellency said: And to say to God what you do not know, all of the corrupt doctrine will be taken over, but the imitator of the truth will be followed; Because, even if he is imitating the truth, he said what he does not know, then he is due to vilifying his mourning under the time of this verse.* * * The loyal question: the talent of the measurement is held by its saying: And to say to God what you do not know and the answer to it: that when the connotation has risen on the one With the measurement, saying to God what he knows, not what he does not know.
