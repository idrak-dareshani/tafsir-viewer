The researcher is the Almighty: God is not ashamed to strike for example a mosquito, so what is lost.So they say what God wanted with this, for example, a lot of it is misled by him and guides him a lot and what is misled by him except the evildoers who are eliminating the covenant God is with him to reach and spoil in the land.Those are the losers.Praise in that and answered it, and the suspicion of the suspicion: that it came in the Qur’an, the remembrance of the bees, the flies, the coffin, and the slaughter, and these things are not met by the remembrance of the words The Qur’an is upon her, praise in his family, as a matter Including a judgment in the language, for this is the sign of the entity of this verse that comes before it, and then in this verse is a question: the first question: the first: the first: O people, a similar one, so hear it [Hajj: 73], so he cursed in their idols and then likened it to its worshipers to the house of the curse, I said: May God reward themselves?This verse was revealed.And the second saying: that the hypocrites stabbed in the beating of the homes with the fire, the shades, the throat, and the lightning in its saying: their example is the same as the one who looked at the fire.[17] And the third saying: that this stabbing was one of the partners, the lock said: Everyone is an inner They pass the covenant of God after his charter, and this is the description of the Jews; Because the rhetoric and the covenant, after that it is for the children of Israel, and the infidels and the hypocrites were mentioned in the wall of the inattentive, and the one who said: And the infidels, what God wanted with this, for example, as well as God is misleading whoever gives and guides those who are grateful [Al -Muddathir: 31] the verse, but those who are in their hearts are satisfied, and they are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are in the hearts of the people, The participants bear that the surah is an angel, so the two sponsors were collected here.If this is proven, then we say: The informing of all here is a standing because the disbelievers and the hypocrites and the Jews were agreed to harm the Messenger of God ﷺ and he went from the first of this.The remembrance of the Jews, the male of the hypocrites and the mention of the partners.And all of them are those who disbelieved, and then the lock said: It may be permissible to descend that, as a result of the reason for it because it is meaningful in itself.* * * The second question: Know that the neighborhood is changed and broken, the human being is offended by the fear of what is tired of it and vilifies, and derives it from life, it is said: my life The man, as it is said: forgot and fear, and the horse: if these members are closed.He made the neighborhood because the crushing and the absence of the power of the power is the murder of life The neighborhood, and it is dissolved, and if it is proven, this is the impersonation of God Almighty because it is a change that is the right of the body.Salman narrated from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: “God is a living, generous living, as if the servant raises to him, his hands are to return them to a whistle, so he will return them.” Likewise, it must be interpreted, and it is in it.That every adjective has been proven to the servant, which is specialized in the bodies, so if God is described, the Almighty is with that, then this is a subordinate to the ends of the symptoms, and there are no symptoms.You have a human being, but it has a principle and a principle.The human being is left of that act, so if the life is returned in the right of God, the Almighty is not what is meant by that fear that is the principle His eagerness and his goal, as well as anger for him a mark and ahead, and she is the blood of the heart and the lust of the ritualization, and he has an end, which is the punishment of the punishment for the one who is angry, and the one who is angry, and the one who is angry, and the one who is angry, and the one who is angry, so With anger, it is not intended for that principle - I mean the lust of righteousness and the spoils of the heart of the heart - but what is meant is that end, which is the removal of the punishment, for this is the law.The second: It is permissible for this phrase to fall into the words of the infidelity, and they said: As for the Lord of Muhammad, Muhammad will be shown to strike an example with the flies and the slander, so this is the way of this words.The answer is on the question, and this is an art of a budget from the words, then (P-123) The judge said: What is not permissible for God from this gender is a proof, so he must not be released on the one who is not to be called It is said: It is not described by it, but it is said: It is not ashamed, and it is called it and a journey; Because he deludes the denial of what is permissible for him, and what God has mentioned is the Almighty from his book in his saying: Do not take it for a year or sleep [Al -Baqarah: 255], and the saying of God: He is in the image of the negation, and it is not a negation of the truth, and it is his saying: God did not take from the son of the believer [91], and so is his saying: and it is not.And not everything that was mentioned in the Qur’an is permissible to be called in the address, so it is not permissible to call that except with Bayan that this is referred.And it is a saying that he said: There is no doubt that these attributes are exile from God, His Glory It is permissible.It remains that it is said: The albumin from its exclusion is indicated by its health on it, so we say: This is a variety of means, and that is because you specialize in this nose that is not.It is proven otherwise, but if it was a corner of the word, what indicates the consequences of health, too That is a tribute.* * * The third question: Know that the hiring of the ideals is improved in the minds and is indicated by his faces: one of them: the kindness of the Arab Mashhaour with them and they have been represented by the hatred of things, so they said in the acting with the atom: a group of atoms, and a bond of an atom, and I am hidden from the atom, and in the anomal He was brought up from flies, made a mistake of flies, and the fools of flies, more like flies with flies, and insisted of flies.And in the seizure of the avenues: hear from a pillar, and a mini -to -picker.And he was attached to a pillar.And cloudy of the ailments, literature from a pillar, and they said in the jams: Air from a journey, destroyed from a struggle, and spoils from a jar.And I am filled with the saliva.And in the butterfly: weakened from a butterfly, a butterfly from a butterfly, and I am ignorant of a butterfly, and in the mosquitoes: we are weakened by mosquitoes, and more than the brain of mosquitoes, and I missed the mosquitoes of the mosquito Approach unbearable.As for the creek, it is indicated by “the book of Kalila and Dumna” and its proverbs, and in some of it: the mosquitoes said, and it was signed on a high palm and I wanted to do it.I seek, so I want to fly, so the palm tree said: By God, I did not feel your hearts, so how do I feel your goodness.And the second: He struck the homes in the Gospel of Jesus - peace be upon him - with the beyonds, who are despised.Pure, when the people slept, his enemy came, and he was planted between the bowls, so when the cultivation came and the grapes of the grapes, the Zawan was overwhelmed by it, so he said: A good, pure stroke that you planted in your village?He said: Yes, they said: So who is this Zawan?He said: Perhaps if you went to take off the Zoan, then take off with the bow, so let them raise them all until the harvest.So the two harvests ordered that they pick up the colors from the bow, and that it bound it with a belief, then burn it with the fire and collect the bow to the cabinet.And it is interpreted for you: that is the man who has grown the good bowls is the father of humanity, and the village is the world, and the good and pure shed is the one who does the people of the angel.God Almighty, and the enemy who has planted the Zoan is a Plice, and the Zoan is the tinkers that Plice and his companions are planted, and the harvests are the angels who leave the people until the people are left They will be the people of goodness to the kingdom God, and the people of evil to the hallway, and that the Zoan is pulled and burned with the fire, as well So they will be thrown into the horsemen, so it is your crying and the teeth of the teeth, and the righteous will be in your kingdom (P-124) their Lord, whoever has a listener.And give you another example that resembles the kingdom of the sky: if a man took a love from a paradise, which is the smallest love and planted it in his village, then he was a ward.It became the greatest of a tree of the words, and a bird came from the sky, so he marched in its branches, so the guidance; He who called to him, may God reward him, reward him, greatly, and raise his remembrance, and he saved those who were fighting with him.And he said: Do not be as a coffin from which the good is removed from it, and it is grabbed the angels, as well as you bring the wisdom from your mouths and keep your hearts.And he said: Your hearts are like a horse that the fire does not mature and does not clarify the water, and the winds do not regret it, and he said, "Do not smoke your huge, where the mites and the land, then it is in the past, The poison and thieves are burned by the heavens and the thieves are caught, but you smoke your lavishness with God.And he said: We are a fossil, so we find the animals of it for its dress, and there is its sustenance, and they are not planted and do not count With their dress and their livelihoods except God?Are you not reasonable?And he said: Do not fly the pipes, then be tired of you, and do not address the fools, and they will be distracted.It appeared that God Almighty set up for the proverbs with these despicable things, and the mind is because it is a fantasy of the fantasy of simulation and analogy, so if the meaning is mentioned and the meaning is the same The ritual of imagination, and if the similarity is mentioned with it, the mind is blessed with it with the imagination of the imagination, and there is no doubt that the second is the most complete, and also, then we see that the human being is not.As he is overwhelmed, then if the example is mentioned, it becomes clear and clearly shrouded, and if the representatives benefit the increase in the increase and clarity, its remembrance must be mentioned in the book that is not the same.As for their saying: the harvesting of ideals with these despicable things is not appropriate for God Almighty, our saying: This is ignorant; Because he is the Almighty who created the old and the oldest and his wisdom in all that was created and a general innocent; Because he has judged all of him, and the little one is hidden from him from the great and the great is more difficult than the young For his worshipers from the young, but the one who is considered in which he is hired by the cut, then if the one who lives with it is the flies and the calamity, then the example will be harmed by the same The worship of idols and their domestication of the servants of the Most Merciful, it was reconciled Its Egypt is unable to do these idols, and the example will be struck by the house of the denial to show that its worshipers are insignificant and weakened from that The proverb is the most powerful, the example was stronger and clear.The following question: The deaf said: The Qur’an is an increase and linguistics, and the most correct is the saying of my father, Muslim; Because God Almighty has described the Qur’an with his guidance and bias, and his being is a prostitute that contradicts that.And in (mosquitoes) two readings, one of them: the monument, and in the word (what) on this reader and Jahan, the first: that it is a building and it is the one who is in the name of the name And it increased it as a matter and distanced from the property.His two, if a man said to his friend: He gave me a book to look at him, so he gave him some books, it is true for him to say: I wanted another book and did not say this (What) It was not valid for him; Because you appreciate the words: give me a book, which book was.The second: It is a denial that its interpretation was in the name of the bond, the standing of the adjective, but for the lifting of the lifting of it, it is in it.Because the estimation is a mosquito, then the beginner is deleted as it was deleted in a completeness on the one who did well [Al -Anam: 154].The second: to be exclusive; For when he said: God is not ashamed to strike an example, as if he said after him: There is no mosquito, so what is on the authority of it, so that he will be rewarded with him, but he is the same, but he is the same, but he is the same, but he is the same Many, as it is said: so -and -so does not give what he endowed, what is dinner and dinars, that is, the most of what is more than that in many.* * * (P-125) Fifth question: The owner of the “scout” said: The example of the proverb: its accommodation and its formation, from the beating of the milk and the confinement of the conclusion.The sixth question: he was affected (mosquitoes) that it is a kindness for (for example) or an act of (he is a ritual) and (for example) a state of denial, or a second To (strike), a meaningful person who makes it, and this is if you (what) are a prayer or a thumb, then if you are an innocent with a compensation, then it is a follower of what is the same, and the interpretation of it, With their entire group, a bias or an act, and (for example) is an advanced condition.As for raising it, then it is a beginner news, but if it is (what) is connected, or a chain of transmission, then it is a matter He said: What is it?He said: Impositor.The sword: the owner of the “scout” said: I miss the mosquitoes from the bit, which is the piece as the stomach and the sweat, it is said: some of the mosquitoes, and from it: some of the things; Because it is a piece of it, and the mosquitoes are in its origin with a row on a verb like the obstacle, so its name was overwhelmed, and from them: His generosity and smallness, and because some The thing is a little with the measurement to all of it, and the strong face is the first, he said: It is one of the wonders of the creation of God Almighty; It is a very young and its majestic in the absence of the younger, then it is with that welfare, then that is the majestic with the excess of its younger, and it is the same And the buffalo on his thickness, as the man strikes his sake in the hideout, and that is because God has installed in the head of his thickness from the poison.The eighth question: in his saying: So what is narrated by it and Jahan: one of them: that what is meant is what is greater than it in the corpse, such as flies, coffin, and the rituals, and the domain, and the people.The representation of God Almighty with all these things.The second: He wanted what was above it in the young, that is, what is smaller than it, and those who achieved money to this saying to Wajoh: One of them: that the intention of this is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was The likeness of it is more severe.And the second: that the presentation is that God is that God Almighty does not refer to the representative of the essential thing, and in the same way as this position, it must be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a second one, It is said: So that so, the humiliation is carried in the acquisition of the dinar, and in the acquisition of what is above it, it means in the few; Because you bear humiliation in the acquisition of less than the dinar is more severe than you carry it in the acquisition of the dinar.And the third of it: that the thing is the smallest, the more he can see its secrets, so if it is in the end of the younger, it is not surrounded by the knowledge On the authority of the ruling from the majority with the great distress, and the first was embarrassed by two Jahin: the first: that he was noticeable, “on the authority of this, then it is the same It is meaning that he is greater than him, and it is narrated that a man praised - may God be pleased with him - and the man is accused in him, so he said to me: I am without what you say and what is in the way From your soul.The second: How does the likeness of the likes of mosquitoes, which is the end in the younger?The answer to the first: that everything was proven in which it is stronger than its evidence in something else.That is the strongest, above the weakening in that row, it is said: And bursting.That is, it is the most of the good and the mourning of it, and so if it was said: This is above that in the young, and it must be more small than it, and the answer to the second is that the wing of the mosquitoes is less God ﷺ is a proverb for this minimum.* * * The ninth issue: The case of a delicate, you said: As for more, it is a goodness, if this is proven, then we say: the revenue (P-126) is two sentences, in which there is a great, and a great and more It is the truth A great defamation of the disbelievers of what they said and mentioned it.The questioner: “The right” who does not justify its denial, is said: the right of the matter: if it is proven and obligated, and the word of your Lord, and the sake of the ritual: The native question is ten: “What” is in it and it is that (this) is a name connected in the sense of the one, so it will be two words, and that it is (what) is a ride with what is) One, it is a single word, so it is on the two, the first is the light of the place on the one who is infected and told it (that) with his prayer, and on the second: As if you said: What God wanted.* * * The second question is ten: the will is what is the sane person from itself, and the alternative separation is realized between it and its knowledge and its ability.And if the matter was like that, it was not visualized by what it needs to be intended.The rhythm, and we are rewarded for this last restriction from the ability, and they were dispersed in his exaggeration, with a murid, with the agreement of Muslims on the launch of this, the sake of God, so God said: It is a negative meaning, and it is meaning that it is not overwhelmed and not developed, and among them is those who said: It is a confirmation matter, and these are dispersed, so the Al -Jahid said: Its knowledge is attributed to the deeds of the verb on the reconciliation or the spoil, and they are called this knowledge of the preacher or the pure, and he said: “Our companions, Abu Ali, and Abu Ali, and Abu Ali, An increase in the knowledge, then the division in that adjective, either to be subjective and it is the second saying of the Najari, or that it is a mean.A valuable, which is the saying of Ash'ari, or an update, and that event is either that it is based on God Almighty, and it is the saying of the Karamiya, or a person who is in the body of this person, No one, or it will be a struggle, not in a place, and it is the saying of my father Ali and my father Hashem and their followers.The third question is the same: the guarantor in “it is the truth” for the example or for (to strike) and in their saying: What God wanted with this, as a rule of it, as he said: In Abdullah bin Amr ibn al -Aas: Oh, the son of Ibn Amr.* * * The fourth question: “For example,” we are on the basis of the distinction, as your saying to those who answered with a sick answer: What did you want with this answer?And who carried a bad weapon: how do you intend with this weapon?Or in any case as his saying: This is a verse of God for you [Al -A'raf: 73].The fifteenth question is ten: God knows that God has greeted and exalted when he told them their disbelief and their entireizer, the words of God with his saying: What God has wanted to do with them: He is gone through a lot and guides him a lot and we want that We speak to us in the guidance and misguidance to be this position as the origin that is returned to it in all that comes in this sense of the verses, so we will speak to the first The ghost is a time that comes to transfer the verb from the one who is transgressing to the aggressor as your saying: Go out; It is not prepared, and if you say: he went out, then I have made him transgressive, and you may come to transfer the verb from the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.It may come to the muddam.It was narrated from Amr ibn Muhadikb that he said to the sons of Silim: We fought you, so what we answered, and we gave you, so what we have given you, and we asked you, so what we have made you.That is, what we found is the coward (P-127), no, and no betrayal.It is said: I came to the land and so I built it; That is, I found it a bitterness, the hidden said: “Two horses wish to make a misery, so I have a horse that has been humiliated and worse It is permissible to say: the gossip does not benefit unless the act is transferred from the one who is transcendent to the aggressor?As for his saying: I poured it, then he would be prolonged, so perhaps the intention was his kindness, and he dwelt himself on his face, so he will be mentioned by the verb, and this is the verb, and this is the verb, and this is the verbal Dear.As for his saying, we fought you, so what we have answered, so what is meant by what has influenced our fighting in your goodness is my cheese.What has affected our spelling to you in your goodness is a whims, as well as the saying in the seeds, and this saying that we said we are first; Pinfing for your destination.If this is proven, then we say our saying: God is pleased with him, it is not possible to carry it except for two bodies: one of them: that he is a lost one, and the second is that he is lost.He made it lost, and it is not in the memorial that it is a reason for what is lost from what, and it is in it.And the second: that it was lost from the paradise, but the first is that it is a reason for which it is lost from the religion, so I knew that the meaning of the misguidance of religion in the language is the supplication to the prayer Eye, and this is the misguidance that God Almighty added to Ebis, and he said: It is a misleading enemy shown [Al -Qasas: 15], and he said: And they are misled by them, and they said: [119] We showed us those who have been lost from gin and human beings, we make them under our feet [Chapter: 29], and he said: The Satan decreed for them their business, so they repelled them from the way [Al -Naml: 24] His saying: And I had no sultans for you, except that I called you, so you answered me [Ibrahim: 22], and also God Almighty added this guarantee to Pharaoh and said: He said: 79].And know that the nation is collected on that this meaning is not permissible for God Almighty; Because it is the highest of what they called for the disbelief and what he wanted in it, but it was forbidden to be imprisoned, and he returned to the punishment for it, and if the original meaning was The delusion in the language is not only this, and this meaning is exile with consensus, it has proven the convening of the consensus on the fact that it is not permissible to conduct this memorization on the appearance.And when the people of algebra and the destiny are destroyed, as for the people of al -Jabr, they carried it on the fact that it was the Almighty created the misguidance and the disbelief in them, and the one of them is from the faith, They said: This is the truth of the word in the origin of the language; Because the misguidance is a phrase for making something lost as the perpetrator and the absence of the ablution of the thing is outside and inside.The linguistic models, and with the sensation of the mental indicators.* * * As for the linguistic obstacles, it is a face of it: one of them: that it is not valid from the way of the language that it is said to those who are forbidden by others from the way of the way, and the ritual of his rituals.From him and his behavior from him, but they say: He is lost from the way, if he wores him and wants from the suspicion of what he wore on him, so he does not.And the second: He is the highest and described the Pellis and Pharaoh with their misleading, with the fact that Pharaohs and Abel were not immortal of misguidance in the hearts When the Jabriyah is because the servant is not able to find, but when the capacity is because the servant is not able to do this type of creation, then when the name The exile of the Creator with agreement, our knowledge is that the name of the misleading is not subject to the language of the creator of misguidance.(P-128) And the third: that the misguidance in the interview of guidance is true that it is said: his guidance is what he was guided.On the creation of misguidance, and in the sense of the mental indicative, there is no face: one of them: that it is up to the creation of the misguidance in the servant, then he wrapped it with the faith of the faith of the faith.The two adversities, which is a shed and a shadow, said: And the Almighty said: What is your Lord with a shadow of the slave [Chapter: 46], and he said: God does not cost a soul except its capacity [Al -Baqarah: 286], and he said: And secondly: If the exalted was an empty and a wise man on the costs of the costs, it would not have been shown to what the servant was assigned to it, and the nation had gathered all over.And the third of it: It is up to the misguidance, and they did not create them from faith.Because the thing that is not able to get the endeavor was in his crime in vain and fooling.And its elevation: that it is a great anti -version of the verses.The guidance came to them unless they said, God sent a messenger of a messenger [Al -Israa: 94], and he showed It is not forbidden for them from the faith, but they are forbidden for their denials of the mission of the messengers from the human beings, and he said: And what people are forbidden to believe when they came to them, and they came to them.55] And he said: How do you disbelieve in God and you are honest, so I will give you [Al -Baqarah: 28], and he said: So you will know [Yunus: 32] and he said: So you will be blessed [95] On the authority of religion, and he disclosed them from faith, these verses were void.Fifthly: He is the Almighty, he died and his party, and whoever has his path is in the misfortune of people from religion and their behavior from the truth and commanded his servants and his messenger from them.I seek refuge in the Lord of the people [Al -Nas: 1] to his saying: From the evil of obsessions [Al -Nas: 4] and say I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clashs [Al -Falaq: 1], and say, Lord, I seek refuge in you from the whispers of the people, so if you read, then the Qur’an, then the Qur’an, so that the Qur’an With God from the righteous Satan, and if God, he will be a misfortune of his servants from religion, as the devils are misled It is obligatory for them, and they must take it as an enemy from where it is more than his creation, as it must be taken as an enemy for the sake of that.As the vulnerability of both the presence of its presence and its numbers, as it refers to the inclusion of the misguidance, by the difference of the abuse of God, it is the influence in the misguidance, so it is necessary for this All the swimmers and referred all of them to God Almighty, so the vilification will be cut off by the kidneys on the authority of Blisis and a pioneer to God.And its sixth: that he has added the delusion about the religion to other than it, and they were vilified for the sake of that, so he said: And the Pharaohs of his people are delighted, and what is guided [Taha: 79] More than those in the land, they are misled by the path of God [Al -Anam: 116], that those who are gone away from the path of God have a severe torment for what they forgot about the day of the account [p.26] And to be misleading, their security, and their commanders [Women: 119], so they are either that they have been lost others from the religion in the truth, or God is the one who is the one who is good.And with them on the way of the polytheism, if God is exalted, they have lost them from religion without these, then it is his grace and the exalted, you may say to them (P-129).(P-129) In what is in it and their vilification of what they did not do, and God is glorified by that, and if God is exalted, he is shared by them in that, so how is it permissible for them to be given to him, and he is a matter So the sacrifice is true that the creation of the misguidance is not added to God Almighty.And its sake: It is the highest mentioned the most verses in which the misguidance is mentioned, attributed to the stick on what he said: And what is misled by it except the evildoers, and God is misleading [27] God does not guide the disbelieving people [Al -Ma’idah: 67], as well as God is misleading who is a murdered person who is forgotten [Ghafir: 34], that God does not guide those who are a liar: 28] In addition to the exalted, it is what they are in, as well as a proof of the wounds, and this is referred.And the eighth: that he has exiled the deity of the things that they worshiped from where they are not guided to the truth, he said: Whoever guides the truth is the right to be followed by the right of the mother.The neglect of the rabies of those things is not the same as it is not guided, and it is obligatory for the same for itself from where it is the greeting of it and the exalted, so if it was the right of it, and if it was the right of it, and if it was the right of it, and if it was the right of it, and if it was the right of it.They were in the misguidance and for his sake, it was forbidden to follow them, but he was raised on them; Because the two, as it does not guide it, it is not misleading, and it is his grace and the Almighty with that it is a god guided, so it is misleading.And the ninth: that it is the exalted, reminding this misguidance, as a reward for them on their bad ones and a punishment for it, and if if the intention was what they were from the misguidance, then it was the one who is the one who is the one who is the delusion, and it was the one who is the reason Passengers, and they are accepted, and they are mortal and disciplined, and if it is permissible for that, the agony would be rewarded with adultery with adultery and the drink of the wine, and this is not the drink.And I adore it: that his saying is up to the Almighty: and what is misleading of it is only the immoral who are eliminating the covenant of God after his covenant is clear that he is the one who does this, but he does this.The incomplete immorality of the covenant of God by choosing himself, so that this indicates that this delusion that will be after his goodness, ponding and contradictory For his immorality.And her lived her lived: He is the highest, and he made the misdemeanor to him in his book, either by his formation and bitterness, or by being a punishment and a pierce, so he said: Malaki and what made us prepare them except a temptation for those who disbelieved [Al -Muddathir: 31] that is, a bunker, until he said: Likewise, God will deliver whoever gives and guides those It is on this direction from its removal of a similar verse or a similar verb that does not know the incitement of existence in it; It is the one who does not stand up to the intended and does not think about the face of the rule in it, but he is touched by the suspicions in the report of the slave of the slave as the one who said: Their hearts are a little, so they follow what is similar to it to abide by the temptation and abide by its interpretation [Al -Imran: 7], and the wise and the calamity are the saying of it.They withdraw [Ghafir: 71], until he said: Likewise, God will mislead the disbelievers [Ghafir: 74], so he indicated that his delight does not count one of these two guys, and if the misguidance is the same The two guys must not be an alienate, without them, a payment of your destruction, so you have proven that it is It is not permissible to carry the misguidance of the creation of disbelief and misguidance, and if it is proven that, then we say: indicate that the misguidance is in the origin of the language supplication to falsehood and the desire in it, in which it is hidden, Therefore, it is not permissible for God, so the destiny is obligatory, and the interpretation that Garden was gone to to him, and we have given it, so it is obligatory Tawlilah: One of them: The man, if he lost his choice when he obtained anything other than that of that thing, is an effect in (p-13) In the right of idols, Lord, they have a lot of people [Ibrahim: 36], meaning they have gone astray, and he said: He does not go to and hinder and flexible and have lost many [Noah: 23] With them, and he said: Let them increase many of them, what has been revealed to you from your Lord, tyrant and disbelief [Al -Ma’idah: 64], and he said: So my prayers did not increase them except for a later [Noah: 6], that is, they did not And he said: So you took them ridiculous until I forget my remembrance [the believers: 110], and they did not forget them in the truth, but they reminded them of God and called them to them With the sake of them because of their forgetfulness, the people are added to them, and he said in lights: And if a surah is revealed, then those who say, which of you increased this, this is more They believed in their faith and they are preaching [Repentance: 124], and as for those who are in their hearts, they are satisfied, and they increased their abomination to their impurity [At -Tawbah: 125].So he told him that the descent of the surah, which is divided into the bodies, is known for their conditions.Unbelievers, then the increase was added in faith and the increase in the disbelief to the surah, as they were reconciled when we were descended and they were aside, as well, so, so, so I will add to the guidance Their events were when he attracted the exalted of the words to them, and he said in Surah Al -Muddhar: And we did not make them only a temptation for those who disbelieved, so that they will be disbelieved.Those who believed in faith [Al -Muddathir: 31], so he told the Almighty that his remembrance of the count of the treasury of the fire is given from it for his worshipers to distinguish the sake of the ritual The believers were reconciled to it and the disbelievers, and added the increase in faith and against it to the consequences, so he said: (To increase) (and to say) Then he said after he said: Likewise, God will be misled by someone who will be guided and guided by those who follow [Al -Muddathir: 31].It is also said in the knowledge: I am satisfied with love; That is, I came to it, and it is said: Follow was spoiled, and it did not know about it, and the poet said: The day is the seduction of any of the people who are tired of the day.And this meaning is permissible to be added to God Almighty in the sense that the disbelievers have gone astray because of the verses that are densely disgraced The one in it, and this two of them are tired of them, this addition was good.And the second: that the misguidance is the name of delusion, and it is said: it is lost; That is, he called him lost and judged him with him, and he disbelieved so -and -so, so that if he called him a disbeliever, and sought the house of the quit: Tarfa: I was still drinking the wind until I lost me ∗∗∗ My friend and until some of me worsened with some of me who wanted my fat lost.This face is what is gone to a dirt and a lot of disgrace, and from the people of the language who denied it, and he said: It is said: I have lost it, if it is a misfortune: So I gave it and dragged it: if I called it a pardon, and it is answered by it when it was he who was pleased with itself, it is lost, then it is necessary to make it a matter of this.For the palace of that formation, and the release of the name of the obligatory on the obligatory, a well -known metaphor, and that he is also used because the man said to another: so that it is lost, so it is a lost You made it lost?And the meaning is: Why did you call it with that, and why did you judge him?On this direction, hold the delusion to (P-131) judgment and name.And the third of it: that the misguidance is the abuse and the leaving the prohibition with the hatred and the mighty, and it is said: It is lost: if it is empty and its misguidance, they said: And from its metaphor, they said: Ali: If he does not pledge it with discipline, and the same is the saying of Al -Arji: ؎ They lost me and any fatwa they lost ∗∗∗ to the day of his kindness and the payment of a burden and the one who said to the one who said The dew until it was spoiled and shocked: you spoiled your sword and fard it.And its elevation: the misguidance and the misguidance is the torment and the torment, with the evidence of its words, the Almighty: The criminals are in misguidance and pricing on the day they are withdrawn in the fire on the authority of their faces.47, They traveled, then they were told where you were to share without God.That delusion was interpreted by torment.Fifth: that the misguidance be carried on the property and abuse as its saying: Those who disbelieved and repelled the path of God, the best of their work is [Muhammad: 1], it was said: The water was lost in the milk: if it becomes an consumption in it, and it is said: I have been guilty: if you do that with it, then his family, and I will make it like the one, and from it, and it is said: The people are their dead: If they see it in his grave, then hide it until it is not seen.In the land, we have a new creation [prostration: 10], meaning that we were buried in it, so our people were hidden, and he is invoked on this meaning: God is misled by a human being; That is, it will destroy it and extend it, so the addition of the misguidance to it is permitted to this face, for this fifth faces if we carry the misguidance of the delusion.And its sixth: that the misguidance is carried by the misguidance of paradise.The exalted that will be misled and there is no significance in it that it is misleading, so we can carry it on the fact that it is a virginity that is misled by the way of paradise, and then they carry all of the Qur’an, and this is the one who is in the Qur’an.The choice of Al -Jaba’i said: He was written on him that he who assumed him is that he misleads him and guides him to the torment of pricing [Hajj: 4] that is, he is misled by the paradise.This is all, if we carry the hammer in the delusion of preparation.And its sake: that we carry the havaz, not to be prepared, but rather the afflictions of what was presented at the beginning of this question by his two, so he said: That is, it is wrong for it, so the meaning of God Almighty has the meaning of them that it is the highest and their grandfather is lost.And eighth: that his saying is the highest: a lot of it is misleading and guiding him a lot of the blame of the saying of the infidels, so they said: What did God want to do so In it, then they said: He will deliver a lot with him and guide him a lot, and they reminded him of the path of recklessness, so this is from the saying of the disbelievers, then he said: He only went on to the immoral.This is the darkness of the words of the disgraced.* * * Al -Jabriya said: We have heard your words and introduced us to the goodness of revenue, good deeds, and the power of words, but what do we do, and you will do you This is the good and the gentle evidence?One of them: the question of the preacher, which is that the grace of knowledge, ignorance, dedication, and misguidance, why did they do one of them without the other?Excellency: God has sealed their hearts [Al -Baqarah: 7] and what we have seen to you in paying these two words is a strong and powerful words, and we do not have a doubt that we do not know that you do not know that you do not know what you do not know The weakness of those dirt that they spoke to, so we described us and introduced us to you with the best of the words that you mentioned, so they will be described as well These two definitions, because the collapsing and the heaviness are not met by the mind.And the third of it: that the act of the servant, even if it was to find it, would not happen except the one who intended to find it, but anyone He only wants to obtain knowledge and deduction, and he will be traveled to be excluded from ignorance and misguidance, so how can ignorance and misleading to the servant do not And the dedication?If it was said: The disbelief was affected by the faith and the knowledge of ignorance, so he thought in ignorance that it is knowledge, so he intended his rhythm, so he did not have the ignorance of us.He thought of a mistake, if he was his choice first, then he was the choice of ignorance and sin for itself, and that is not possible It is necessary for him to be before every belief, not to an end, and it is referred.And the one that is very upset: that the perceptions are not as a cable, the beginnings of the incense, and it is not like a cable and the beliefs of their families, as it is not, so that this is the one.The first: In Bayan, the perceptions are not as confined, and that is because those who try to receive them are: either to be conceived for it, or it will not be fired for it.If he was conceived, it is impossible to ask for a perception that she would have obtained a referral, and if he is not a perception of it, he was a delusion of it, and he was so forgiving, Something is impossible to be a student.The second submission: In Bayan, the beginnings are not like that, because the two spears of belief is either sufficient in the reward of the time It is sufficient, if the first was that confirmation is constant with you, the two perceptions are on the way of the obligatory, and there was no way The belief is physical, but it is standing in it.The third old: in Bayan that beliefs with their families are not a tribal, and that is because these theories are if they are obligatory for the one who is the same A portion of those theories were also unable.And if it is not necessary for those alternatives, the beast could not be found by those of these alternatives on those theories, so that you will not be in those who have been in those who have been The theories are scientists, but rather they are unable to get the imam and our words are in it, so you have proven that your words are in the conjugation of the guidance and the misguidance to God.The mental faces that are not answered.We will now speak as they mentioned it from the interpretations: As for the first interpretation, it is fossil; Because the removal of these similar peoples has an effect on the sake of the reasons, or does it have no effect in that?If the first is obligatory for your saying to be ugly to two John, the first: that we have indicated the interpretation of his saying: God has seen on the hearts of God: 7] The righteousness must have a must and it is not between the levels and between the garment The objection is from the contradiction, and if the landing of these similar intercourses affects the survival, it is that when the hypothesis occur You said it.The second: He endowed that it does not end up to the limit of the obligatory, except that the cost is that it is a joke of excuse and the cause, and this is the most similar to it with it (P-133) The misguidance is on the side of the guidance as excuses for the cost in the number of feet on obedience, so it is obligatory to urge that from God Almighty, but if it is not for you to do so Singing the side of the misguidance on the side of the appetite, the lineage of this similar to their misguidance as the shore of the door and the hindrance Foreign Affairs, as well, must not be attributed to these similar to the face, and then they will be dominated by their followers.As for the second interpretation: it is the name and the judgment, it is, even if it is in the end of the distance, but the forms with it remains; Because if God called him with that and ruled with him, he would not have come to him, and the cost of him would not come to him, then the news of God is true, and his knowledge is ignorant, The cost of it is referred to it, and it comes to it with it, and this is the eye of the mighty, which you escape from it, and that it is your metaphor, not a referral, and here it is the search for the answer to the answer.A sane person knows the beginning of his mind.As for the third interpretation, which is evacuation, and the abandonment of prevention, this is called an addition if the first and the best of the child is to prevent it from that, then if it is for it, then if it is the one who is the one, then if it is the one who is.On the authority of that falling in a greater spinning from that first spoil, no one said that he spoils his son and misled him, and we are the matter with the difference of that; Because it is up to the cost of the cost of this spoiling, it was necessary He prevented him from misguidance with that if he had forbidden him, that spoil was great.As for the righteous interpretation, the lock has been subjected to it, and he said: We do not surrender that the misguidance came in the sense of torment, but the words of the Almighty: the one who is the one who is in It is possible that what is meant is a misguidance of the right in the world, and in the price; That is, in the torment of hell in the hereafter, and it is his saying: a day they will be withdrawn [the moon: 48] from the sake of pricing, and the saying of the Almighty: for the majority in their essence: [71] Likewise, God is misled by the infidels [Ghafir: 74], so his saying is: they gave us away; That is, they are overlooked, and we did not interact with them in this day that we were hoped for in it, then his saying: Likewise, God is misled by the disbelievers: 74] Likewise, God will mislead their business, that is The resurrection, and it is immersed: as well as God, may God bless them.The resurrection has been overwhelmed by their work that they were hoping for the benefit in the world.As for the fifth interpretation: it is the property, it is not appropriate for this position because its saying is up to the Almighty: and it is guided by a lot that prevents from carrying the misguidance.As for the sixth interpretation: it is that it is misleading from the way of paradise, weak; Because he is upset, he said: He is misled by it, that is, it is misled by the exemption of these verses, and the misguidance of the way of paradise is not because of these verses, but rather the rituals of the authority, but the grace of it, but the grace of it, but the grace of the Lord, but it is the same.It is permissible to carry it on it.As for the sequence, it is that it is said: “Al -Anam: 125”, meaning that he finds it lost, has indicated that the proof of this language is not indicative of it, and it is not the same.The B: He is misleading with it and misleading in the sense of the afflictions.(P-1334) As for the eighth interpretation: in this verse, it is necessary to dismantle the systems; Because it is to say: (He is a lot of misleading and guiding him with a lot) from the words of the infidels, then his saying: And what is misled by him except the evildoers is the words of God The letter of compassion, which is waw, then he endowed that he is like that, but he is in the wall of the consequence, and he is his saying: Likewise, God will be misled by whoever is the one who will be guided: Hope, this is the speech in the misguidance.* * * As for the guidance, he came to his faces: one of them: the connotation and the Bayan.38] And this is true even if the guidance is a sign of the Bayan, and he said: If they follow except the thinking and what the same loves, and the guidance came to them from their Lord.Either as disbelief [man: 3], that is, whether thanks or disbelief, the guidance has come in the two states, and he said: As for the thumbs, then we guided them, so they loved the blind upon the guidance: On the one who is good and detailed for everything, guidance, and mercy, perhaps they may meet their Lord, believe [Al -Anam: 154], and this is not said to the believer, and he said: Peace be upon him -: Do not stipulate and guide us to the path [p.22], that is, we guided us, and he said: Those who watered them from their lines after what was revealed to them for them They have [Muhammad: 25], and he said: To say a soul, I will be pleased with what I have been involved in the side of God [Al -Zumar: 56], to his saying: Or do you say that if God is guided by me: His saying: My verses have come to you, so you lied to it and arrogated [Al -Zumar: 59], tell it This is the disbeliever of what he came from the verses, and he said: Or you say that if we were revealed to us the book, because we are more than them, so he came to you from your Lord and guided [Al -Anam: 157] For disbelievers.And the second: They said in his saying: You do not guide to a straight path [Al -Shura: 52], that is, you call, and say it: and for all the people of Haddah [Al -Raad: 7], that is, a reason that calls them.And the third: Exclusivity from God with kindness that is stated in faith, the believers are given a reward for their faith, and it is upon him, and for the sake of this And by his visits against him for the disbelievers, which is that they will be robbed of that, and it will be with the fact that it is the highest of what guided them will be their goodness, and the evidence is on this direction: This is increased by this [Muhammad: 17], and God who guided them is more guided [Maryam: 76], and God does not guide the unjust people [Al -Baqarah: 258], God is proven by those who believe The world and in the hereafter, and God will deliver the unjust [Ibrahim: 27].The oppressors [Al -Imran: 86], so I told that he does not guide them and that the evidence has come to them, so this guidance is not the same, and there is no referral, and he said: And whoever believes in God: Those have written in their hearts faith and supported them with a spirit from it [Al -Mujadila: 22].And he paid it: the guidance to the way of paradise, the Almighty said: As for those who believe in God and keep it with it, then they will enter them into a mercy from him, and they will be blessed.And he said: A light and a clear book that God has guided by God has guided you from God who followed his pleasure is the paths of peace and brings them out of darkness to the light with his permission to the ears of his ears.“ Except to paradise, and the Almighty said: Those who believe and do righteous deeds guides them with their faith in their faith.Fifth: Hoda in the sense of adherence, it is said: This is a so -and -so.That is, he presented it in front of him, and the origin of this guidance of the way; Because the evidence provides the sign.And the Arabs say: I accepted the horses of the horses; That is, its advances, and it is said to the neck: Hadi, and the horses of the horses: its embrace because it is old.And its sixth: guided; That is, he rules that the believer is guided, and his name is this because the truth of the saying is the saying: He guided him: He made him guided, and this is the one who has been given, and he said.Hope: What God made from a lake [Al -Ma’idah: 103], that is, what was judged and not legalized, and he said: The guidance is the guidance of God [Al -Imran: 73], meaning that the guidance is not the ruling of God He is guided, and he said: Whoever guides God is the guided by [Al -Kahf: 17], meaning whoever roses God to him with guidance, then he is eligible to be called to be called, so this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the And we have spoken to us while it was presented in the chapter of the misguidance.Al -Jabriyah said: We are another face, which is that the guidance is in the sense of the creation of guidance and knowledge.Al -Qadriyah: This is not permissible; Lojoh: One of them: that it is not correct in the language that it is said to those who carry it other than the ways of the way of hatred and mighty, that he guided him to him, but it is said to him, but it is said to him: It is upon him and his jewelry to him, but it is said: He guided him to him, so no.And secondly: If this is the same as the creation of God, he will be overwhelmed by the matter, the forbidden, the praise, the vilification, the reward, and the punishment, then it was said: He is the creation of God, the Lord, the Lord.We said: This gain is a burden from two faces: the first: that the fall of this movement is either that it is the creation of God Almighty, or it is not that it was created, if it is, if it is, if it is, if it is, then it is, if it is, if it is, if it is, if it is, then it will be, or it will be with it When God created him, he was embarrassed by the servant to refrain from him, and when he did not create it as a matter of the servant who comes to him, then he will come.And if he did not create God Almighty, but from the servant, then this is the saying of the seizure.The second: If it was a creation of God, the exalted and an estrangement to the servant, he would not be free from one of the three faces, either God creates it first and then he will be done The servant acquires it first and then creates God Almighty, or the matter falls with it, then God created him, the servant was forced to be forced, and he will be over.The servant is first, for God is forced to create it, and if they fall with it, this matter should not be obtained except after their agreement, but this agreement is not for us.This agreement, and also this agreement must only be obtained by other agreement; Because it is from his gain and action, and that leads to what he has no end of agreement while he is referred.This is the darkness of the words of the disgraced.Al -Jabriyah said: We have indicated the mental signs that do not accept the invalidity and the interpretation that the creator of this verb is God, or with the abuse, or by the abstraction, And the faces that you have touched by the faces of a transfer that is subject to the impersonation, and the residents do not oppose it, so the destiny is obligatory to what we said, and with God.* * * The sixth question is ten: for a saying to say: Why did the Mahdi describe the many, and the few are their description; For his saying: and a few of my servants, thanks [Saba: 13], and a few are [p.: 24] and for a hadith: You say it, and the answer is: The people of Hoda are many in themselves, and where they are described as the few, but they describe it (P-136) with the measurement to the people of the delusion, and the abundance of the misguidance, Many in the truth, and if they say in the image, they called many back to the truth.The swallowing question is ten: Al -Farah said: The evildoer is its origin from their saying: The wet was made from its scales; That is, it is out, as if the evildoer is the outside of obedience, and the mouse is called Fawqaqa for its exit for the sake of the harmful, and the disagreement of the people of the kiss, So we have our companions that he is a believer, and when the Kharijites are an infidel, and when the one who is disgraced is that there is no believer or disbeliever, and the person who violates the saying of God is the saying of God: [Al -Hujurat: 11], and he said: The hypocrites are the evolving people [Repentance: 67], and he said: The faith loved you and decorate it in your hearts, and hated it to you, disbelief, immorality, and disobedience [7] A long time is mentioned in the science of speech.
