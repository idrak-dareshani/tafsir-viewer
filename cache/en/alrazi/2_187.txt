The researcher of the Qur’an is glorified and exalted: I will be blessed for you, the night of fasting, and you are a dress for you, and you are a dress for them, and God knows that you have been for you Now, they shared them and occupied what God has written for you and entrusted to you (P-88).You will see them as you are in the mosques that are the limits of God, so do not bring them closer, as well Jamour went to the interpreters that in the first project of Muhammad ﷺ the fasting person was if he breaks, he would have a solution for him, drinking, and hacks on the condition that he does not sleep, and that he does not sleep, and he does not sleep One of them is forbidden by these things, then God Almighty has copied this with this verse, and the father of the Muslim Al -Asfi said, this is what was forbidden in the forbidden.It was steadfast in the law of the Christians, and God Almighty has copied this verse that was steadfast on their part, and he was seen in it on his time that he did not fall into our time.And the crowd on their saying of his faces: The first pilgrimage: that his saying is up to the Almighty: He wrote to you fasting as it was written on those who have been written by those who are.[183] Our fasting with their fast, and this deprivation was fixed in their fast, so it is obligatory with the ruling of this similarity, that it is a good thing, and if it is a good thing, and if it is a good thing, and if it is a good thing, and if there is a ritual, then it is a good thing.It was steadfast on our part, and this verse is a dirt for this prohibition, so this verse is a dirt for a ruling that was fixed in our part.The second pilgrimage: holding the Almighty saying: I will be blessed with the night of fasting to your women, and if this solution was steadfast for this mother of the mother of the mother of the mother To say it: I have a good for you.The third pilgrimage: holding the Almighty saying: God knew that you were the same as yourself, and if that was permissible for them, they would not have been for them.The hungry Hajj: His Excellency said: He was blessed with you and pardoned you, and if not for that he was forbidden to them and that they were submitted to the disobedience, for the sake His saying was correct: He repeated you and forgives you.The fifth pilgrimage: His Excellency said: Now they are preached, and if the solution was steadfast before that, as it is now, it was not for his saying: Now they are preached.The sixth pilgrimage: is that the narratives that are transmitted in the attainment of this verse indicating that this deprivation was steadfast on our part, this is the same With copying.The father of Muslim answered this indicative, and he said: As for the first pilgrimage: a weakness, because we have shown that the fasting is similar to the fast in the fast.As for the second pilgrimage, it is also weak, because we are delivered that this forbidden was steadfast on the basis of those before us, so he said: “It is not possible for you to be.Other than you, I have been permissible for you.As for the third pilgrimage: also weakened; That is because that sanctity was steadfast in the law of Jesus, peace be upon him, and that God Almighty has to pray for us, and he did not show that the brief In them, that the sanctity was steadfast in the advanced law, and there was no extension of what was indicated by its disappearance, so the saying is required, then this is the same With his words: He wrote to you as fast as it was written on those before you, because the similarity is required (P-89) that is similar to all of the affairs, so it was the same.The deprivation is fixed in the advanced law, it must be fixed in this law, and if it is not a powerful argument, it is no less than that it is less than that For the sake of these reasons, they would be able to meet that deprivation on our part, so they did not intend to intend and hold on this matter; And God Almighty said: God knew that you were the same as yourself and wanted to the Almighty to see the believers with the fear of what they did not.And hold on to these affairs and shorten themselves from the desire, and prevent it from what is meant, and the origin of the horse is the deficiency, and it is two sisters, and it is eaten with the same Call, acquit and gain, for what is meant by the verse: God knows that if if only the most of you, the drink, and the dullness of the night, did not show you the length of the night.Its lusts and their inspiration for its sacrifices and its reconciliation by holding on to that after the sleep of the Christians.As for the hungry argument: weakness, because the repentance is from worshiping to God Almighty with worship, and from God the return to the servant with the mercy and the mercy of the So God Almighty showed his gratitude to us by relieving what he made a trust on those before us, as he said: He puts them from them and the absence of them was the one who was: [157] As for the fifth pilgrimage: a weakness because they were in the cause of that suspicion, abstaining from the mourning, so when God has shown that, he said: They preached.As for the sixth pilgrimage: weakening is because our saying: This verse is a dirt for a ruling that was a hidden one that does not relate to it with the door of the work and does not have the word The verse is what indicates the weakness of these narratives because the reminder in these narratives is that the people are recognized by what they did when the Messenger, and that is upon the words You were the same Entity, this is the case with this question.* * * The greatest, drink and intercourse, what the man does not throw or pray the last dinner, then if one of them did, these things are forbidden to him to the next night, and the one who comes from the one who comes from Foreign Affairs, and the fasting has stressed it, and they differed in his name, so he said: Sarmah ibn Anas, and the Messenger of God asked him ﷺ about the weakness of his weak So I slowed down, so I woke me up, and he has been deprived of the oldest, and he said: O Messenger of God.So I came to my wife, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: You were not new to that, O Omar, then a men rose up, so they recognized the one who made it, then he said: Plume to your women." The third question: The owner of the “scout” said: Reading.The following question: The one said: The night of fasting wanted the fasting of fasting, so the one signed the fall of the group, and from it the saying of Abbas ibn Merdas: I have been seen from the tune of the breasts (P-90) and I say in it another side, which is that it is not what is meant from the “night of fasting” one night, but what is meant is the sign of the night to the night to the night.The truth.* * * The fifth question: Al -Laith said: The spoiler is the origin of the obscenity, and the gospel sought: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ His words are spoiled and spoiled if he spoke to the neighborhood, he said: So, he did not spoil nor a debauchery [Al -Baqarah: 197], and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he was chanted while he was forbidden: The best of the good is a good thing, so he said to him: Do you go?He said: Rather, it was what was with the women, so it was proven that the ritual in the spoiler is the saying of obscenity, then it was made a name for what is spoken of it from the people of the It is about the consensus and everything that follows it.If it was said: Why did he be from the intercourse with the memorial of the spiller indicating the meaning of the ugliness with the difference of his saying: I have led to some of the women: [21] You did not seek the women [Women: 43], you entered with them [Women: 23], before you touched them [Al -Baqarah: 237], so what you enjoyed from them [Women: 24] and do not bring them closer [222].His answer: The reason is that it is found before The answer is as he called it a choice for themselves, and God knows.The sixth question: Al -Akhafs said: Rather, the spoiler has to be guaranteed to include the meaning of the hypothesis in his saying: It may lead to some of you [Women: 21].* * * The seven question: its saying: I will be permissible for you for the night of the ritual fasting.He drives the spoiler, even if all nights were busy with the spoiler, otherwise it would have been disbelieved in that ritual, some of the night, not all of it, so do this.He who said in his saying: Eat and drink until it is clear to you the righteous steps from the smooth steps, so that it will be as sure of this copy His saying: I will be permissible for you for the night of fasting, and the ritual solution is in the night.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: It is a dress for you, and you are a dress for them, so they have questions: the first question: We have mentioned us in the young man, whoever is the same: The man and the woman were eager, so each one of them included his body to the body of his owner until each of them becomes one of them to his friend, like the wickedness, One of them is a dress.Al -Rabi’ah said: They are a butter for you and you are a cashier for them, and Ibn Zaid said: They are a dress for you and you are a dress for them, he wants that each one of them is a one who is a person who is a one who is a person who is a person who is a one of them.The people.And the second: Rather, the Zojan was called a dress that each one of them was made by what is not permissible, as it came in the news.And the third of it: that he has made it a dress for the man, from where he specializes in himself, as he specializes in his dress for himself, and he sees it as a family because he is not a family.He works in the dress.And its booster: It is possible that the intended will be for it from (P-91) all the spoilers that fall into the house, if the woman is not present, as is the present, as is the present, as is the present, as is the present, as it is, as it is On the free and cold and many of the harms.Fifth: The deaf stated that what is meant is that each of them was like a crushing dress for the other in that lucky one who does it, and this is weak because it is a weak The way of the year for us, so how to carry the release of them in the banner.The second question: The one said: The dress unit after his saying: “here” because he is running the course To you.The third question: The owner of the “scout” said: If you say: What is signed by his saying: They are a dress for you, so we say: He is a nose of the same as the two of the people, and it is the same Between you and between them like this mix Licked your patience with them, and their abuse is weakened by them, so this is what you have authorized in their pans.* * * As for His Exalted Him: God knew that you were the same as yourself, and he has anxes: the first question: it is said: his betrayal will be betrayed, if there is no time, for the time of it.He walked about Al -Darab, then he betrayed you, and the forever betrayed him if he changed his condition to evil, and the man betrayed the man if he did not perform the safety, and the contradiction is disgraceful, because he was waiting for him, because he was waiting for him, because he was waiting for him.And among him is the saying of the Almighty: Either you are afraid of horsemen [Al -Anfal: 58], that is, a contradiction to the covenant, and it is said to the man of the debtor: He is a traitor, because he is not, because he is not, because he is not.His Excellency said: Do not betray God and the Messenger and betray your trusts [Al -Anfal: 27].The disobedience is with intimidation, and if you know the meaning of horsemanship, the owner of the “scout” said: The eternal from the betrayal, such as the acquisition of the gain in which there is an increase and intensity.The second question: God Almighty mentioned that they were betraying themselves, except that he did not mention that this betrayal was in what?So it is imperative to carry this betrayal on anything that has a consequence of what was presented and what has been delayed, and who is presented is the remembrance of the consensus, and the one who is delayed They preached, and it is obligatory to be the one who is interested And eating after the sleep and ride the forbidden from that, and everyone who disobeyed God and His Messenger has lost his soul and he betrayed God, because he is the one who has gone to the punishment It is cut on that it was signed by some of them because he could not be carried on his entirety from all of them, because his saying: God knows that you are God.He was carried on his appearance, and they were obligated to be two trends for themselves, but we have taught us that what is meant by the oppression is for us, and if it is true, and if it is true It is cut off from the fierceness of this banned gathering from each other.We have indicated that the betrayal is a phrase for the abundance of what is obligatory for it, so you have carried it on the nodd of the one who is in the end of God, and we are the one who is the one who is a good Ely, because God Almighty did not say: God knew that you were betraying God, as he said: Do not betray God [Al -Anfal: 27], but he said: You were not, and you will be.On what we mentioned, if it was not the first, then no less than equal, and with this estimation, the copy is not proven.The second saying: that what is meant: God knows that you were You are the same, if that deprivation and its meaning are: that God (P-92) knows that if it is long for that the hardship of the hardship, and they will fall into the abundance, and they will fall into the abundance, The betrayal was made and it can be said: the first interpretation is the first; Because there is no need in it to add the condition and it is said: Rather, the second is the first, because on the first interpretation it becomes their feet on disobedience, because of the transcription of the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second.God knows that if this is the same, the betrayal would have obtained the betrayal, so that we have caused us to copy the leaving, mercy from God, who is upon him to the servants of God.As for his saying, “He repents to you, and he was blessed with the saying of my father, a Muslim, so he returned to you with the permission in this action and the expansion of you, and on the authority of the one who said: It is in it from the perpetrators of its estimation: you will repent and repent to you in it.As for his saying, the Exalted: He pardoned you, so he said the saying of my father, a Muslim with it, and he expanded you to allow you the greatest, drink and pensions in all nights, and for the sake of pardon Tinker and lightness.Peace be upon him said: “I forgive you for the charity of the horses and the thickness.” And he said: “ The last time, and it is said: This money is pardoned, that is, easy, and it has proven that the pardon was not unable to feel the precedent of the prohibition, and as for the saying His saying: Pardon you, and it must be able to: forgive your sins, and this is what is strengthened, too, the saying of my father is a Muslim, because it is not the same, so that it does not.The interpretation of the copy is the transcription, it needs to be added.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Now they will be blessed with two issues: the first question: this is an issue and a response to the barrier, so those who said: The matter is the one who is the bad thing For the porn, their words are back, and those who said: The matter is the matter of the duty, they said, but we left the apparent and recognized us as this matter of pornography.* * * Peace be upon him - "It is forbidden for a man to be shot, and the woman is the woman." The second: It is the saying of the deaf: It is the consensus, so what is without it and on this direction, those who are in the sense of his saying: And do not preach it, and you are in them, and you are in the way of those All the pans and did not limit it to the intercourse, and the closest to the conservation of the missionaries, when it was derived from the adherence of the two human beings, and it was not a special one, but it is a whole The intercourse with the vigor, as well as the embrace and the contact, but they agreed in this verse that what is meant by it is the intercourse; Because the reason for this privilege was The fall of the group of the people, and because the advanced puff is the remembrance of it, except that the gathering is only that the permissibility of the consensus was the permissibility of what it is permissible without it.Permission to what he prepared, so we are correct to carry the words on the whole of the intercourse, and when it was in the reward that is forbidden from the consensus, it does not indicate the prohibition from what is without it.This is the one who must be taken care of, on what the judge summarized.* * * As for his saying: And seek what God has written for you, and he has books: The first question: Remember in the verse, he guided: one of them: and seek what God has written for you, You will be seen to spend the desire for one of it, but the abuse of what God has placed for him to marry from reproduction.He said - peace be upon him: “Do you have a lot.” And the second: that he forbade isolation, and the news was narrated in the hatred of that, and Al-Shafi’i said: He does not isolate (P-93) the man from the free one, except for her permission, or by the authority of the nation, and it is not.Asim on the authority of Zur Bin Habish, on the authority of Ali - may God be pleased with him - that he was unable to defame the isolation, and on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Prophet ﷺ “He forbade isolated from the authority.” And the third of it: that the meaning is: seek the place that God has written for you and its solution without what was not written for you from the forbidden place, and his opposite is the saying of the one who said: May God bless you [Al -Baqarah: 222].And its capacity: that this affirmation is its appreciation: now they will be preached and occupied this mob.Fifth: He is the saying of my father, Muslim: Now they will be blessed and seek what God has written for you, this means this missionaries, which God has blessed you, and you have written it Forbidden to you.And its sixth: that the consultation of the wife may be prohibited in some of the facts in the causes of incitement, breaths, enemy, and response, so he said it: and seek what the book of God does not The circumstances and the guns that are ears for you in their vocabulary.And the sake of it: that his saying: Now, they will be blessed with the missionaries, and his saying: And seek what God has written for you, it means that you do not seek this That is the one who wrote to you by saying: except for their waves or what their faith possessed [Al -Maarij: 30].And eighth: Muhah ibn Jabal and Ibn Abbas said in the narration of Abu al -Jawza: It means asking for the night of destiny and what God has written for you from the reward in it, if you find it Repeat this face, and when I have no badness, and that is that as long as his heart is in a way of asking for lust and pleasure, he is not able to do so.For obedience, servitude, and presence, but if he is spent and enriches and is empty of requesting desire, he can then be free.For the slaves, the ability of the verse: now they have shouted to them until you are giving up from those dungeons from the sake of salvation in the servants, and if you do not, then you will be from them.From the salvation in the servitude in prayer, remembrance, praise, and the abuse, and the request of the night of destiny, and there is no doubt that this narration is on this estimation other than the one.* * * And he said: So we wrote with the two witnesses [Al -Amran: 53], so I wrote it to those who fear [Al -Arif: 156], meaning: make it.And secondly: God has spent you, as he said: Say: He will not afflict us except what God has written for us [the repentance: 51] that is, he ruled it, and he said: “He wrote to God,” And he said: The ritual of those who were written on the killing [Al -Imran: 154], that is.And the third of it: its origin is what God has written in the brightest wave of what is being, and all the ruling has judged with His servants, so he has proven in the urine.And the one who has been: It is what God has written in the Qur’an from the permissibility of these actions.The third question: Ibn Abbas read, “and seek“ and read the people ”and they were overwhelmed.As for his saying: Eat and drink, and the benefactor in their remembrance is that they prohibit them and prohibit the consensus with the night after the sleep, when it is presented in the authority of each of them.The prohibition goes away, and if he would be fulfilled on his saying: Now they will be blessed with them, and he did not know that the demise The significance is permitted.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: until you show you the righteous steps from the bound of the immorality, so it has an questions: the first question: Uday ibn Hatim: I took two signs of Abed and the supplies (P-94), so I made them under my corruption, and I was standing from the night, so I looked at them, so I did not.From the bonds, when I became a lunch to the Messenger of God ﷺ So I told him and laughed, and he said that you are to be sick of the nape, but that is the light of the day and the darkness of the night.ﷺ: ““ You are to be satisfied with the nape ”because that is what is inferred by the man of the man, and we say: it is a piece of cut The night, and there is a problem that is that the white of the morning is like the tasty mixture is the white of the liar morning, because it is an evacuated white that resembles the steps, so the steps are the same It is a light that is reflected in the horizon, so it was necessary for the merits of this verse that the first day of the day is the ritual of the false morning His Exalted at the end of this verse: from the dawn, is it The question is necessary, and that is because the immorality is called a dawn because it explodes the light from it, and that is in the second morning, not in the first morning, for the first day, for the first The father must be from the dawn, know that it is not what is meant by the liar morning, but rather the sincere morning, for it is said: so how is it the sacrifice, so it is the same.The sincere morning is not an upheaval and the steps are delegated?And his answer: that the destiny of the whiteness that is forbidden is the first of the sincere morning, and the first of the sincere morning is not spreading, but it will be a young man, and the separation is between it The false morning is that the false morning is upset, and the honest looks like a minute, and it increases the picnic, so the question is still, but what was reported on the authority of the enemy, Because he is hidden from the like, this is the slogan with his words, the Almighty: from the dawn.The second question: There is no doubt that the word “even” is for the end of the end, so this verse was indicated that the solution of the monster, the eating, and the drink is forbidden, The Muslim Al -Asfi is that there is nothing of the breakfast, except for one of these three, but the things that the jurists remember from the cost of vomiting, injection, and the ritual With a breakfast, he said: Because all these things were permitted, then this verse was indicated by the prohibition of these three on the fast, after the sake The original, so there is nothing of them as a break, and the jurisprudence said that God is the Almighty.She hates them, and the struggle is rare, so this is not reminded of it.* * * The third question: the father of Abu Hurairah and Al -Hassan ibn Salih ibn Hayy is that the side if it is permissible before the abandonment, then it was not for him, and this is a fast for him They say that if the mobilization is permissible until the exaggeration of the morning, it could only be able to send it after the exaggeration of the morning.* * * The loyal question: the lawful of the people is that it is permissible for the elderly, the drink, and the intercourse after the soil, and before the sun was a measure of the first day, the first day is the first of the day.With the strawberries of disk, it is necessary to be the first to prolong the dances, and he said in the verse that what is meant by the righteous composite and the wicked stereotype of the day, and the night, and the lord, As for the likeness to be in the form, it is not permissible, because the injustice of the horizon is the case of the sacrifice of the morning, and it is not possible for it to be likened to the wealth of the It was proven that what is intended for the white component and the most common line is the day and the night, then when we search for the truth of the night in his saying: Then they come to the ritual of the ritual Time The absence of the sun with an indication that (P-95), may God bless him, after the strangeness, with a night with the meeting of the light in it, so it was proven that the matter is the first of the day.Before the sun of the sun, and that the day is not found except when the ritual ritualization, so this is the report of the saying of the general The last day of the day, and among them who said: The breakfast is permissible until after the roll of red It has been backed, and the jurisprudence gathered on its heroes, so there is no extensive in the exclusion of the words in it.The fifth question: “the dawn” is the source of your saying: I died the water, and it was a dawn, and I died it with a triggered.The last night is the creation of the injustice of the night with the light of the morning, * * * * As for the saying of the Almighty: from the dawn, it is said to the metaphor, because the one who is the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one For the two people, as if it was said: the white steps that is the dawn.The sixth question: that God is exalted, when the gathering, eating, and drinking is to the end of the morning, must be known to be known to show the morning what is it?So we say: The way to the knowledge of the sacrifice is either that it is a piece or thinking, but the Quta’i is that the sacrifice of the morning is seen, or it will be made from the time of the time.The sacrifice of the morning with it, and the shadow is a transmission: either that it is a belief that the morning is asking, and the greater is forbidden, the drink, and the bond, for the sake of the one who is the most And the fact is permissible, then if it is eaten and then it is clear after that, that the thinking was wrong and that the morning was brought up at that time, then they have been dispersed, and they have been dispersed, and they have dispersed She was strange, then he breaks down, then it turned out that she was not strange, and Al -Hassan said: There is no elimination in the two pictures, a measurement of what if he had eaten, and the father of Hanifa said in Malik and Malik.On the authority of it: It is obligatory to be judged because he is commanded by fasting from the morning to the stranger and did not come to it, and the people have a money that is obligatory for him to judge.They said: The evidence is required and the jurisdiction is required for him as well, except that we have fallen from him to the text, which was narrated And I am a fasting person, and peace and blessings be upon him: God bless you and your watering, so you are the guest of God, and you will complete your fast.And the third saying: If he makes a mistake in the sacrifice of the morning, it is not obligatory to be eliminated, and if he makes a mistake in the sunset, he must be eliminated, and the difference is that the origin is in every steadfast The night is the solution of the most, and the day is forbidden.The meeting of the night and not the ritual of the morning, but the rest is standing in the two things, for it is the most distant for it, the drink, the drink, and the intercourse, then it is permissible, because it is the one who is the righteous.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Then they complete the fast to the night, and it has the books: the first question: that a word to the end of the end, so the revelation of the verse is that the verse is that The night, and that is because the end of the thing is its cut and its place, but rather it is a cut and it is not.As in the words of the Almighty: to the accompanying [Al -Ma’idah: 6], except that this is on the convergence of evidence, and the difference between the two pictures is that the night is not from the sweetest of the day.The day, and the one who escapes from the gender of the hand, is inside it, and Ahmad ibn Yahya said: a path to the entry and the exit, and both of the two things are coming, you say: I eat it.That the head will be inside and outside of it, except that he does not doubt that the mind is that the night (P-96) is outside the fast, if it was inside it, it would be in it.The companions in the washing is taken with the trust, then whether we say that it is beautiful or not beautiful, so the authentic hadith was repaid in it, and it is what he narrated from Omar - he said: God ﷺ: “If the night kisses from here, and the day of the day is made of us, and the sun was strange, then the fasting woman has been broken”, so this hadith is that it is not possible for me to be.As for the fact that the cost is required for this time something, so the evidence is upon him what the Shafi’i narrated - may God be pleased with him - from the authority of God - from the authority ﷺ It is forbidden to connect, it was said: O Messenger of God, you will communicate, that is, how do you forbid us from something that you do?It was said in it: one of them: that he was fed and watered from the food of paradise.The second: that he - peace and blessings be upon him - said: I am very trustworthy that if I had taken food, they bought me continued.Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri narrated from Ibn al -Zubayr, that he used to communicate seven days, and when he grew up, he made it five, and when he grew up, he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three, so he made it three days Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - indicates that this forbidding is forbidden, and it was said: It is forbidden to be promoted, because it is left to the permissible, and on this one, this is the right Al -Zubayr.If you know this, then say: If you take a little, and if it is a drop of water, then this is the choice in the severity, except that the woman is afraid of the default, The paths of worship, then it is necessary for it to be informed of the food that is destroyed by this fear.* * * The second question: they were disagreed that the night is what he?Among the people who said: The last day is on his first, so they were considered in the night of the night, the effects of the effects Some of them are satisfied with the louds of the redness, and among them is the one who expressed the appearance of complete darkness and the appearance of the makers, except that the hadith that was narrated by Omar, and the work of it.* * * The third question: Hanafi, they are held with this verse that the discipline and the consequences are not considered in the validity of the fast, and they said: The fast is in the ritual, and they said: Here, he will be a fasting person, so he must complete him, because he said: Then they came to fast to the night, so the saying is obligatory, for the sake of his health, for the sake of his health And hardship, and it is exile with the saying of the Almighty: and what he has made you in the debt of embarrassment [Hajj: 78], and his saying: He does not want the hardship to you [Al -Baqarah: 185] The correctness is in the original, and then we say: this indication is required, that the fasting is valid with the structure after the disappearance, except that we say: the least is the right to the one who is more With a structure after the disappearance and corrected his intention before the disappearance.* * * The loyal question: Hanafi, they are held with this verse that the fasting of the nose must complete it.For the beard, and it is all the fasting, and the preservative said: This is only a response to the rulings of the fast of the premise, so it was intended from the fast.The seven judgment * * * is one of the rulings mentioned in this surah, the custody, its saying is up to the Almighty: and do not preach it while you are in the mosque.Know that it is up to the fast, and he showed that from his ruling to prohibit the mourners, it was permissible to think in (P-97) the struggle that his condition is like the righteousness Dar, not night, and he showed the exalted, the prohibition of the mourners in it, in it, and night, so he said: Do not preach, and you are afraid in the mosque, then in the verse: May God be pleased with him: the abhorrent reward is the obligation of the woman to the distress and the love of itself is upon him, and it was or a sin, the Almighty said: And the lawful reward: the one who stays in the house of God is close to Him, and he has a return to the piety of the name of the gender with the vice, because of the knowledge, and it is the one who said: A purification of my house for those who are familiar and the people [Al -Baqarah: 125], and he said: Do not preach them and you are working in the mosque.The second question: If the man touched the woman, without a lust, it is permissible, “Because Aisha - may God be pleased with her - was the man of the Messenger of God ﷺ In a lust, or kiss it, or make it out of the vulva, it is forbidden to The rest is, and does it invalidate it?لِلشّافِعِيِّ - رَحِمَهُ اللَّهُ - فِيهِ قَوْلانِ: الأصَحُّ أنَّهُ يَبْطُلُ, وقالَ أبُو حَنِيفَةَ: لا يَفْسُدُ الِاعْتِكافُ إذا لَمْ يُنْزِلْ.Those who said with corruption begged that the origin is in the memorization of the monsters, to meet the two humanity, so he said it: Do not preach it to prevent this truth, so the one who enters the These are the things, because the name of the monster has all.If it was said: Why did you carry the preachers in the verse presented on the intercourse?We said: Because what is before the verse is indicated that it is the gathering, and it is his saying: I will be permissible for you the night of the ritual fasting, and the reason for the revelation of that verse is that it indicates that it is the same The intercourse was then that without the intercourse with the first way, but there was nothing from these readers, so it is necessary to keep the memorial of the preacher, and the preacher of the Whoever said: It does not invalidate the reward, all of us are allocated that this monster does not spoil the fast and the pilgrimage, so it is not necessary to spoil the reward; Because the reward is not the highest of them, and the answer is that the text is presented to the measurement.* * * The third question: they agreed on that the condition of the custody is not the gel in the mosque, and that is because the mosque is distinguished from the captive of the bun Obedience is in it, then they disagreed with it and transferred from me - may God be pleased with him - that it is permissible only in the mosque in the forbidden, and the argument is in which he said: And the people [Al -Baqarah: 125] So that the house is appointed to all the people, and if it is permissible to fight it, otherwise it is not true that the general is true, and a bid said: The city, when Abd al -Zubayr narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: “A prayer in my mosque is more than a thousand prayers, while it is from the mosque, except for the sake The mosque is better than a hundred prayer in my mosque.Hudhafah said: It is permissible in these two mosques and in the mosque in the house of the sanctuary for his saying - peace and blessings be upon him: The forbidden, the Aqsa mosque, and the mosque this.Al -Zuhri said: It is only valid in the college, and Abu Hanifa said: It is only valid in a mosque with an imam who is a salary and a mortgage of the salary, and Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him: The mosque, except that the collector mosque is better, so that he does not need the exit of the prayer of the collection, and the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - be pleased with him - that he said: You will see them as a public mosque in the mosque.* * * (P -98) The loyal question: It is permissible for the reward other than the fast and the best to fast with it, and Abu Hanifah said, it is not permissible except for the sake, This is the verse, because it is Other than the fasting, and God is the Almighty, it is forbidden to see the woman’s virtues, and if his reward was void, he would not have been varied, he left the work with the back of the righteousness, then the noble, if it is not.On the basis of origin, and the Mazeen carried out the health of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with them - with three things He is the obligatory either the fast of Ramadan, and it is invalid because it is obligatory in the cause of the month, not by the cause It is correct in Ramadan, we know that fasting is not required by the reward.The second: that if the reward was only permissible, it is permissible to pray for the fast of the fasting person with the night of the reward for his exit in which he was from the good, and it was for the sake of goodness We knew that the reward is permissible for a day of fasting.And the third: “Ibn Omar narrated - may God be pleased with him - he said: O Messenger of God, I have been vowed in the ignorance to stop God for a night.It is known that the fast is not permissible at night.* * * The fifth question: Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him: Do not be able to admire the rewards, and if it is a virginity, he will be rewarded for an hour, and he will be held, He is removed from his vow by rewarding him for an hour, as we are worse to believe in divorce, charity, with a few or many, then he said: He stops a day, but he said that to the elderly about the dispute, because Abu Hanifah - may God be pleased with him - is not permissible to reward you with less than one day, the condition of the condition of And it comes out after the sunset, and the preacher of Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - is that it is not the ability of the disbelief with a certainty from the time of the time of the time, Administration and return to the least that must be, and the Hajj of Abu Hanifa - may God have mercy on him - that the reward is the love of the soul on it, and that is not the same, and this is not the same التَّقْدِيرِ لا يَتَمَيَّزُ المُعْتَكِفُ عَمَّنْ يَنْتَظِرُ الصَّلاةَ.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Those are the limits of God, in his books: the first question: His saying: that is not permissible for him to be a reference to the ruling of the ritual, because the righteousness God is the Almighty, except for one, and it is the prohibition of the monster, but rather a sign of all that is presented in the first verse Displacement.The second question: Al -Laith said: The one is the one who cuts it and its place, Al -Azhari said: And from it it is said to the warship that is limited, because it is a variety of people.For the lobb: a hardening because it prevents people from entering, and the house is what is forbidden to enter into it, And the limits of God is what prevents it from its violation, and the speakers are called the universal words of the obedience to the end, and the new one was called a new one because it is forbidden, and so that it is the most Zain.If you know the detence, then say: What is meant by the limits of God is his limits, that is, his estimates that he destroyed with special and described.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Do not bring it closer, and in it, the first: The first: that his saying is up to the Almighty: that is the limits of God, a sign of all that is presented, and the affairs of the one who is presented, And some of it is a barrier, so how did he say in all, so do not bring it closer.The second: that he said in another verse: Those are the limits of God, so do not assaulted it [Al-Baqarah: 229], and he said in the verse of the parameters: (p-99) and whoever disobeys God and the Messenger of God: [14] So do not bring it closer, as the group is among them?The answer to the two questions is from the faces: the first: the best and the strongest is that whoever is in obedience to God and the work with his parts is, then he is short in the matter of the truth, so it is forbidden for him to be The misguidance is permitted, and then it was gone in that, so it is forbidden to bring the limit that is the pilgrim between the right of the right and the false He steps down, as he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: “Every king has a fever and the diqam of God is his incest.The second: What the father of the Muslim Al -Asfahi mentioned: Do not bring it closer, that is, do not expose it to the change as its saying: and do not bring the money of the orphan [Al -Anam: 152].The third: that the rulings removed as before, even if they are many, except that I approach them to this verse, but it is his saying: and do not preach it, and you are in the authority of it.The verse is his saying: Then they complete the fasting until the night, and that requires the prohibition of the elderly and drinking in the day, and before this verse, it is said: and it is what he said: The prohibition of the exclusion of the husband is prohibited, and the prohibition of their exhibitions is in the entirety of the dead and the prohibition of their exhibitions in the menstruation, the breath, the enemy, the ritual, and the custody, and the righteousness, And eating and the bonds at night, when the rulings were more frequently prohibited, there is no crime, the prohibition of the prohibition prevailed, and he said: That is the limits of God, so there is no What you are forbidden is that you are forbidden to prevent God and forbid it from it, so do not bring it closer.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Likewise, God shows his verses to people, in his face and face He made his evidence on his debt and his legs.And the second: Abu Muslim said: What is meant by the verses of the exhibits he explained as he said: a surah that we descended and imposed on it and we have revealed in it clear verses [Al -Nur: 1] and then he was pleased The verses by saying: The adulterer and the adulterer [Al -Nur: 2] to the path of what he has shown from the rulings of adultery, as if he is up to the Almighty, he said: Likewise, God shows people to what he did not.Come.Third: It is possible for what is meant to be the groan of it, when the rulings of fasting are among the rulings of the fast in this verse with a few, and he said: God shows his verses to people, that is, like this clear clear Bayan is the one who is mentioned to people, and the extent of it is the greater the state of the two, and the greatest of the mercy of it Its remembrance is like this Bayan.As for the saying of the Almighty: Perhaps they fear that it has passed again.The eighth judgment
