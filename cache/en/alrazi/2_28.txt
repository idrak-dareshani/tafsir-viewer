The researcher is the Almighty: How do you disbelieve in God and you are honest, so I will live you, then he will die for you, then he will live for you, then you will return to him The neutrality, the prophecy, and the return to this position, from this position to his saying: Yabari, I will remember my blessing, which I have been blessed with: Who did all of the costs, which are four: the first: the grace of life, which is the reminder in this verse.And I know that his saying: How do you atone for God, and if it is in the images of the intelligence, then what is meant by the crying and the arrival; Because the greatness of the blessing requires the great disobedience of the blessing, then it is clear that the father is the word, the more his grace on the father and his Lord, and his Lord, And he presented him to the matters of goodness, his disobedience to his father was greater, so he explained his grace and the Almighty with that of the greatness of what they have given to the disbelief, with the disbelief, with the disbelief, with the disbelief, with the disbelief.To them to make them impure them with that of what they have taken upon them from the disbelief and send them to the acquisition of faith, so he mentioned the highness of his blessings, and he is the one who is the origin of this The one is the one who is the whole, if it was said: Why was the first compassion with fulfillment and seeds by then?We said: Because the first life has been followed by death, without being crushed, and the death has been spared from life, and the second life is like that - A phenomenon, and we are the first: For disbelief in them, it is not permissible to say: How do you disbelieve in God crushed to them, as it is not permissible to say: How do you want to and you will be and they will be.That was a collection of his creation in them.And the second: If their creation was first for the burdens and the fire and what he wanted to create them except the disbelief and the will of the ligament in the fire, so how is it correct to say that it will be disbelieved: how is it?And the third of it: It is how it is reasonable from the wise to say to them: How do you disbelieve in God if the disbelief creates in them, and he says: And what is forbidden is the one who is forbidden.He prevented them from faith, and says: So what they do not believe in [the defection: 20].[Al -Anam: 95] So they spend [Yunus: 32] and they create dismantling and disgrace, and the same is the same as this speech that it is considered to be from the sake of the one who is mentioned in the chapter of the obligation of the servant.And he paid it: that God is upset, if he says to the servants: How do you atone for God, so if he remembered this speech, you will show it to the argument on the servant, for the servant, for the sake of the servant?If this meaning was not in this sense, it was not in It is a good remembrance, so this speech was a vast, and if he mentioned it to bring him the Hajj on the servant, for the servant to say: He gets in the right of a lot of things For atonement.The first: that you knew about the disbelief from me, and the knowledge of the disbelief requires disbelief.The second: that you wanted the disbelief from me, and this will is due to it.The third: You created the disbelievers in me and I am not able to remove your action.And the fourth: that you created in (P-139) capable of disbelief.And the fifth: You created a will to disbelieve.And the sixth: that you created in a capacity required for the will due to the disbelief, then when these six reasons were obtained in the crime of disbelief and faith, it is on the authority of the disbelief and faith.The six causes are in the way of faith, and with its families, it was incomprehensible, so it was obtained for the faith of faith, two ten times, one of which is in the absence Many how is it reasonable to say: How do you atone for God?Fifthly: He is upset, he said to his Messenger: Say to them: How do you atone for God who has bestowed upon you with this great grace, the meaning of the good There is no grace for him to be exalted on the infidel, and that is because they have everything that God Almighty did with the infidels, so he did it to be able to reiterate it to the disbelief, and it will be buried, and it is burned, God is on the servant on this estimation, and is that only with a house of those who came to others, a newspaper But when his interior was humiliating, one is no longer a grace, and it is known that the permanent torment is more harmful than that poison, so it is not for the sake of God.His Messenger is commanded that he say to them: How do you atone for those who bless you with this great blessings.The answer is that this face is when the search is returned to holding it to hold the way of the praise, the vilification, the matter, the forbidden, the reward, and the punishment, so we will be in the way This suspicion, which is that God is glorified and exalted that he would not be, so if he was found, his knowledge would be ignorant of ignorance, and he is referred to and the referral of the referral, so it is a matter He said: How do you disbelieve in God and you are honest, so I will give you and also, so the ability is on the disbelief if you are righteous for faith, and it is forbidden to be a source of faith It is likely, and that is the most likely if it is from the servant, the question is, and if it is from God, then what is not like that is the most likely to God It is obligatory, and on this, how is it unreasonable: how do you atone for God and know that the disgraced if he prolonged his words and he was raised in his face in the praise of the With these two districts, they are guided All of his words and confuse all his suspicions, and with God the Exposition.* * * Because the creation of the creation of Adam from the dust and the creation of the captives of the costs of his children except Jesus - peace be upon him - from the sperm, but they disappeared that the name of the name A truth or metaphor, and most of them are metaphors; لِأنَّهُ شَبَّهَ المَواتَ بِالمَيِّتِ ولَيْسَ أحَدُهُما مِنَ الآخَرِ بِسَبِيلٍ لِأنَّ المَيِّتَ ما يَحِلُّ بِهِ المَوْتُ ولا بُدَّ وأنْ يَكُونَ بِصِفَةِ مَن يَجُوزُ أنْ يَكُونَ حَيًّا في العادَةِ فَيَكُونُ The beasts and the wetness, and the first said is a truth in it and it is narrated from Qutah, he said: They were honest in the solids of their fathers, so God bless them, and then they will be exalted, then the exalted, then the exalted, then the end It is necessary, then they revived them after death.They are two lifes and two deaths, and they took his saying: He created death and life [King: 2] and the death provided for life is his time, so he indicated that the launch of the dead is on the authority The first and the first is the closeness; Because it is said in the beauty: It is a dead, and it is not dead, so it is like that it is the severity of one of them in the other on the way to the similarity, the locking of it said: The human being is from forever, and it was not mentioned [Man: 1], so he showed his grace and the Almighty that the human being was nothing.They said: So, so is the dead.This is a dead matter, and this is a dead authority: if there is no student or male, the hidden person said: ؎ And I lived for me, my remembrance, and what is good, and it is a good, and it is a good, and it is not (P-140) This is the meaning of the verse: You were honest, i.E., illegal, and there is no remembrance for you because you did not have anything, so I will give you any, so make you a hearing creation.* * * The third question: People with this verse begged for the torment of the grave, they said: Because he is high, indicating that he lives in the time of the world He reminds the life of the grave, and his saying is confirmed: Then you are after that, then you are then you are the day of resurrection, you will send it [the believers: 15, 16], and it is not a remembrance of the time.The two states, they said: It is not permissible to say that the Almighty said: Our Lord said, two of us, two and two of us are two years.I have proven the life of the analogy in the crucifixion of Adam - peace be upon him - when he took them out and said: Did you not seek your Lord [Al -A'raf: 172] and on this estimation, he will get the two of the people.Life in the grave, the answer: it was not necessary from the numbers of remembrance in this verse that it is not a hall.Also, he said to say: God Almighty mentioned the life of the grave in this verse; Because his saying: Then he revives you, is not the last life, otherwise when it is correct to say: Then you will be returned because the word (then) is required to be The punishment for the permanent life is not possible.The following question: Al -Hassan, may God have mercy on him, said: How do you disbelieve in God, which means the public, and some people have lost themselves.His saying: Or as he passed over a village and she is a fear of her veins [Al -Baqarah: 259], to his saying: God died of him a hundred years and then sent him [Al -Baqarah: 259] Those who came out of their path and they are the most wary of the death, so God said to them, then they will die and then protect them [Al -Baqarah: 243], and his saying: So I took you and you.After your death [Al -Baqarah: 55] and his saying: We said they were raised by each other, as well And God is a right and that the hour has no doubt in it [the cave: 21], and his saying in the story of Ayoub - peace be upon him -: And his family came to him and the example of them is with them [84] His family after their death.* * * The fifth question: the body is held by the Almighty saying: Then to it, you will return to it that it is high in a place, and this is weak, and it is intended to be judged; Because he is the transcendence of those in the graves and the collection of them in the mud, and that is the return to God Almighty, but it was described with that, because it is no longer, so that it does not come.As they said: He returned his command to the Emir, that is, where he is not judged.* * * The sixth question: This verse is indicative of matters, the first: that it indicates that it is not appreciated by life and death except God Almighty, so he will be the same That the influenced in life and death is like this and so of the wages, the makers, the ancients, and the moods, as it was narrated from a people in his saying: They said what is only our worldly life, and we will die [Al -Jathiya: 24].The second: It indicates the validity of the wise and the publication with the alerts on the indicative indication of it; Because he is the Almighty, showing that he revived these things after their death in the first time, so he must be valid in that second time.The third: it indicates the cost, the desire, and the exhaustion.The lord: It is indicative of algebra and destiny, as it is presented.Fifth: It is a sign of the beasts in the world because he said: So I will live you and then die for you and then revive you, so he showed that it is necessary for you to die, then do not The death, but it is necessary to return to it.As for the death, it is necessary to show it.(P-141) that he was after a sperm, for God has greeted him and portrayed him the best of a picture and made him a single good human beings, and his mind is completed and made with the goodness And the children, the role and the shortcomings, then it is an adult that removes all of it from it by his death and evaluates it in terms of there is nothing Les, as he said: And from behind them, the believer [100], he calls, so he does not answer and condemn it, so he does not speak, then the closest people will be visited, but the people will be forgotten.As Yahya Bin Mu’az Al -Razi said: “My relatives are bitter with my grave harm, as if my relatives did not know me and also said:“ It is as if I had my soul, and I have been broken in it, Those who are wandering about her pledge of allegiance, and he cried for her to scratch her, and called her from the coward of the grave, with her affiliation, and she was rejected by the elderly when she was not.The views are the cushion of its trips, so what is my hope is that you say what you say my angels, they look at a person who may distance him from the closest ones, and the only one of the people of the loved ones Reading and in the length of the length, and I was in the world, and I have to be kind to me, and I will be my goodness to him when his prayers to this house are hoping.The extent of the forgiveness.As for the return to God, it is because he is a command that he is commanded to blow into the pictures, so he was stuck with those in the heavens and whoever is in the land, except for those who will God, then God is then, then he will be.They look [Al -Zumar: 68], and he said: They come out from the juveniles as if they were to a stabilization that they will be presented [Al -Maarij: 43], and then they will be exposed to God as he said: and they are exposed to the Lord: So they will be submissive, and they are subject to those who said: The voices were scared of the Most Merciful [Taha: 108].And some of them said: Our God, if we rise from the richness of the events, are dusty, our heads, and the severity of fear is pale and our face Our stomachs, and a state of the people of the standing, and is esteemed from the weight of the visits.With your symptoms about us, and expand your mercy and your forgiveness for us, O great mercy, O wide forgiveness.
