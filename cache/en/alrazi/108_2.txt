The researcher of the Qur’an is up to your Lord: He separated your Lord and committed in the verse.When the grate of the thank you, when he said: So he separated and did not say: Thank you?The answer: From the faces: the first: that the thanksgiving is a phrase for the glorification, and it has three pillars: one of them: it is related to the heart, which is that he knows that that is not from it.The second: with the tongue, which is to praise him.The third: by work, which is to serve him and put him to him, and prayer is a disgrace to these suffering, and on what is more than it, the command of the prayer is a matter of God, and the command is a matter of God.And the second: that if he said, thank you, if that was delusional that he was not complaining, but he was one of his first command, he is a disobedient with his Lord, he was obedient to him, and he was a blessing for him With the revelation, he said: You did not know what the book and no faith [Al -Shura: 52].The third: that in the first thing that he commanded by prayer, Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said: How are I praying and I am on the light, so God said: We have given you (P-12) Gabriel with his labels on the ground, so the water of the caravan was picked up, then he said, and he said to him at that To command your soul and the man of creation with obstacles, and honor the prayer, separate your Lord.The second saying: So separate your Lord, so thank your Lord, and it is the saying of a juvenile and a generosity, and on this saying, they mentioned in the use of fulfillment in his saying: Alerting it is that the thanks of the grace is obligatory for the Fur, not to be spawned.And the second: that what is meant by the fulfillment of the punishment is the sign, to what it decided by saying: I did not create heaven and human beings except to worship [Al -Dhariyat: 56] and then he is the same Against, and he said: Worship your Lord until the jungle comes to you [Al -Hijr: 99] and because he said to him: If you empty, then set [Al -Sharh: 7], that is, do you.My blessing to you is not to you, not for you to seek the suspicion of that.The third saying: So separate: So God calls that prayer is the supplication, and the benefit of fulfillment on this estimation is as if it is the Almighty saying: before your question and the prayers of you: How after your question, but: “Ask you to give it and intercede.Because it is close to the wedding.The second question: in its saying: to your Lord and the one who said: The first: It is the saying of the general inhabitants: that what is meant is the sacrifice of body.And the second saying: that what is meant by saying: (and he committed) is a verb that is related to prayer, either before it or in it or after it, then they mentioned it in it: Al -Farah said: Its integrity is accepted.And the second: Al -Asbah Ibn Nabatah narrated on the authority of peace be upon him, he said: When this surah came down, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: With my Lord?He said that there is no soup, but he commands you if you are forbidden for the prayer to raise your hands if you grow up and if you kneel and if you raise, then you will be blessed, and if you prayed, then he will be blessed, and if you pray The angels who are in the seven heavens, and that everything has a decoration, and the adornment of prayer raises the hands when every greed.And the third of it: It was narrated from Ali ibn Abi Talib that he was pleased with this sacrifice by putting the hands on the sacrifice in the prayer, and he said: He raised the hands before the prayer, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And put it on the usual and submissive.And the sequence of it: Ata said: It is with me, the one between the two prostrations, until we seem to be free.Fifth: It was narrated from the laughter, and Silman al -Tayyimi said that they said: The chest is said to the sacrifice of the milestone; Because his heine is in his chest, where the throat appears from the top of the chest, then the meaning of the sacrifice in this position is the injury of the sacrifice as it is said: its head and the stomach of it, if it is from it.Al -Farah: It is a phrase for the exclusion of the kiss, and Ibn al -Arabi said: North, and Al -Farah said: Their homes are rushing, that is, it is met and sought: He says: The kaaba is my house, and it is the kiss of your prayers, your heart, and the kiss of my mercy and the look of my care.The body is the first to the face of it: one of them: that God is the highest, the more he mentioned the prayer in his book, the zakat reminds it after it.And the second: that the people were praying and rising to the two, so he said to him: He was separated and fled to your Lord.And the third of it: that these things are the etiquette of prayer and its frustration, so it was inside the one under his saying: So he separated your Lord, and it is obligatory (P-122) that the meter is from the good.Because it is a distance from all of the things on all.And its elevation: that his saying: (separate) a sign of the greatest of the command of God, and his saying: (And he refrained) a sign of the compassion on the creation of God and the sentence of the servants of God The two of the two.Fifthly: that the seizure of the sacrifice is more famous than the sacrifice of the body.We say: Hanafi was inferred on the level of sacrifice that God Almighty has commanded With the sacrifice, and it is necessary and it has been done; Because the obligation is left for him, and if the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did, then we have the same for him to say: (And follow him) [Al -A'raf: 158] God loves you [Al -Imran: 31] and our companions said: The matter of follow -up is devoted to his saying: “Three were written on me and did not write to you, the sacrifice.” The third question: He disagreed with those who interpreted his saying: (He separated) by prayer on his faces: the first: that he wanted the prayer of the prayer of prayer; Because they were praying for the other than God, and they were rushing to other than God, so he commanded him not to pray or flee except for God Almighty, and he broke the one who is good.And that is because he was upset with prayer with the fact that he did not explain this prayer, and the father of a Muslim answered, and he said: He wanted the prayer of the abundant, but the good is not.Because the entity was known before.The second saying: He wanted the prayer of Eid and the sacrifice; Because they were offering the sacrifice for the prayer, so this verse was revealed.Press.The third saying: On the authority of Said bin Jabir, who prayed the dawn with the ritual, and he fell into a smile, and the closest is the first saying; Because it is not obligatory if the remembrance of the sacrifice of prayer is obligatory to perform the prayer on what falls on the day of the sacrifice.* * * The loyal question: the blame in his saying: Your Lord has in it and a fence: the first is the first: this is the blame for the prayer as the spirit of the body, so that the body is from the body It will be good, raised if there is a spirit in it, but if it is dead, it will be dumped, such as prayer, kneeling, and prostration, and if it is good in the image and long, it is not, For your Lord, it was a dummy dead, and what is meant by his words is up to Moses: and perform the prayer for my remembrance [Taha: 14] and it was said: It was their prayers and the sacrifice of their rituals, for the sake To be your prayers and sacrifice to God.The second one: as if he said: He was mentioned in the advanced surah that they were praying for prostitution, so you are not for the innocence, but the path of salvation.The fifth question: the fulfillment in its saying: a separation that benefits the captivity of two things: one of them: the captivity of worship as if it was said: the abundance of the year is upon you With the slaves.And the second: the captivity of the blessing of indifference, as if they said to him: You passed, and he said to him: As we have blessed you with this, the many blessings, and you will be done, and you will not be.These are them.And know that when the many blessings are loved and the loved one is loved, and the loyalty is in his saying: So the ritual of the prayer of the prayer is from the prayer Prayer has become loved by things The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The village of Aini was made in the prayer“ “And he prayed until it was honored, so he said to him: Your sin and what you are delayed?His saying: (Separate).(P-123) The sixth question: The righteous was in the phenomenon to say: We gave you the proliferation, so he separated for us and committed, but he left that to the saying of it: Fifaids: One of them: that his arrival on the way of fools from the mothers of the chapters of the eloquence.And the second: that the words of the words from the one who is the one who appeared to the appearance requires a bone and a fearful, and from it the saying of the breathtaking for those who address them: He commands you The believers.And the third of it: that it was said: We gave you not in a wise man, because he said that this saying is God or otherwise, and also the word: We himself, so if he said: He prayed for us, to deny that involvement, which is that he would not know that this prayer is for God and his mother, and for him, and for the other He said, and he said: So separate your Lord to be an isolation of that involvement and permissible with the neutrality of obedience and work for God Almighty.The following question: His saying: He separated your Lord, the most exaggerated of his saying: So separate to God; Because the utterance of the Lord benefits the advanced education referred to it with his saying: We gave you the proliferation and the beautiful promise is not in the way.The eighth question: In the verse, two Questions: One of them: that the masculine is the punishment of the prayer is zakat, so why was the masculine here the sacrifice?.The second: Why did he not say: sacrificed until all types of victims are included?And the answer: On the first, as for the saying of those who said: What is meant from the prayer is the prayer of Eid, the matter is a back in it, and on the saying of those who carry it on the authority of the prayer, then the one who is the one The participants were their prayers and their closeness to the two, so he was told: Make them to God.And the second: that among the people who said: It is peace be upon him, he would not enter into the king of something from the world, but rather he possessed the destiny It was obligatory for him to say: “Three written on me and did not write on my nation: the sacrifice, the sacrifice, and the teeth.” And the third of it: that the most dearest of money with the Arabs is the camel, so he commanded it to be so we have and drew it to obedience to God, the exalted be upon him, to be alerted to the cutting of the people of Nafiqiyyah, from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, “May the peace be upon him, be a hundred in which a camel is a camel for my father.The camel was overburdened by the Messenger of God, and when he took the knife on it, it was made from it.” The victims, and also in it, indicate that you are after your poverty, you will make the hundred from the camels.Because the waw requires repeat, but rather, peace be upon him: “Start with what God began with him.” The journey of Al -Bashra with the curse of the state, and the disappearance of poverty and fear.
