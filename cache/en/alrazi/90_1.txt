The Quranic researcher (P-163) (Surah Al-Bilad) is twelve, angel ﷽ I do not divide this country and you are a solution to this country and a father and what has been created in the human being in the human being With this country, and you are a solution with this country and a child, and we have not created the human being in the life of the whole of those who are the ones that the country is Mecca, and I know that it is a good God Almighty made it a safe sanctity, and he said in the mosque in which it is: Whoever entered it was safe [Al -Imran: 97] and made that mosque before the people of the family, You were way On people, the pilgrimage of the house [Al -Imran: 97] and he said in the house: And when we made the house a reward for people and a security [Al -Baqarah: 125] and he said: And when we have come to the Abraham, the place of the place is that the place is not.And he said: And on every guarantor, he comes from every deep fog [Hajj: 26] and he deprived the hunting, and made the house the perpetrators with his weight, and the world was given from the world, and it is from it.From it, when it was gathered in the Mecca, the crime of God is called.As for his saying: You are a solution with this country, so what is meant by it is a matter: one of them: and you are residing in this country, in which there is a situation in it, as if it is the one who is a greatness Peace be upon it.And the second: the solution in the sense of the permissible, that is, that the infidels are part of this country and do not violate the prohibitions in it, then they are with that and with the honor of God To harm you, and if you could kill you, you will be a solution for them in their mims, and they will not see you from the forbidden thing to see it for others, on the authority of you Sayyid or support a tree with it, and they will be killed and killed, and in which you are proven to the Messenger of God ﷺ and sent to the imitation of what he was suffering from They are in their aggression for him.And the third of it: Qatada said: You are a solution, meaning: you are not a sinner, and it is permissible for you to kill the king of whom you wanted, and that is that God is exalted, and he will be blessed, and he will be blessed with him On one of him, then he would have whatever he wanted and deprived what he wanted and did what he wanted, and Abdullah bin Khatil was killed while he was attached to the veils of the kaab, and the son of the son of a My father, Safyan, then said: “God has forbidden the Mecca on the day of the creation of the heavens and the earth, it is forbidden until the hour is established, and it is not permissible for anyone before me, It is dissolved only an hour of day, so it does not support its tree, and its cells are not dispensed, and it is not repeated, and its cat is not permissible except for a tension.Al -Abbas said: Except the ammunition, O Messenger of God, for it is our homes and our graves, so he said: Except the ammunition.If it was said: This surah is an angel, and it is said: You are a solution of news about the situation, and the occurrence that you mentioned, but I spoke in the last period The group between the two things?We said: The memorial may be the case and the meaning is accepted, as it is the Almighty saying: You are dead [Al -Zumar: 30], and if you say to those who prepare it, the generosity and the love: From God is good, because the one who is accepted for him is like the present in the reason that he does not prevent him from his promise.And its elevation: You are a solution with this country, that is, and you are not committed in this country, what is forbidden by you, its commitment to the greatness God and the messengers.Fifth: It is up to the time when this country was divided into the absence of this country, then he said: You are a solution with this country, that is, and you are from the solution of this And the people of this country know your origin, your lineage, your tenderness, and your righteousness, the longevity of your life from the ugly verbs, and this is what is meant by the saying of the Almighty: He is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who says From them [Friday: 2] and he said: A messenger has come to you from yourself [Repentance: 128] and his saying: I have been subjected to you for a year before him [Yunus: 16], so the exaggeration will be He is from this country.As for his saying: A father, and he does not know that this is kind to his saying: I do not swear by this country and say it: You are a solution with this country, and the one is the one It is upon him, and for those who are interpreters in it, it is one of them: one of them: the child is Adam.The transparency, the mobilization, and the sacrifice of the sciences, and the prophets and preachers to God Almighty and the supporters of his debt, The names are all, and God Almighty said: And we have honored us with the children of Adam [Al -Israa: 70] So the oath will be the oath with all the Adamites, who are good and their goodness, for what is of what he said This structure and composition, and it was said: It is an oath of blood and the righteous of his children, based on the fact that those who are good are as if they are not from his children and as if they were.As he said: If they are only as aid, but they are the best of a path, [Al -Furqan: 44], deafness is a blind heart, so they do not return [Al -Baqarah: 18].And the second: that the child is angam and Asmail, and he did not get Muhammad ﷺ and that is because he was divided into Makkah and Abraim, with her and Asmail and Muhammad upon them, peace be upon them.The imitation of praise and admiration, but he said: He did not say and did not say, and whoever is born, for the vagina of existence in his saying: And God knows what he put it A wondrous synthesis.And the third: the birth Abraham, where the Arabs and the legends bear.The sentence of the son of Abraham are the inhabitants of the virtuous boundaries from the land of the Levant and Egypt and the house of the sanctuary and the land of the Arab The child of Ibrahim from the Arabs, and among them who specializes in that the Muslim Arabs, but we said: This division is located in the son of Abraham, the believer is that the believers are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: “As you prayed on Ibrahim and the family of Abraham.” They are the believers.And he pursued it: It was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said: The child who gives birth, and what he is born who does not give birth, because “what“ here will be for the negative And who is not born, and that is not permissible for the Basrin.Fifth: I mean every father (P-165) and Mawlad, and this is appropriate, because the prohibition of creation is all within this words.* * * As for his words, the Almighty said: We have created the human being in a luxury, and he has questions: * * * * The first question: The man turned a luxury, and it is a bold if his heart is painful and breathed, so he expanded in him until he is used in every tired and hardship, and from him, and he is a good He hit him.Others said: The luxury is the severity of the matter and from it the milk will be given to the milk if it is overwhelmed and tightened, and it is the bond because it is blood that is tightened and tired, and the difference is between the one A picker of the age, then the intensity was derived from it.On the second, the memorization was made a syndicate for the severity and thickness, then the name of the member was derived from it.The second direction: that the luxury is the level of leveling and righteousness.The third face: that the luxury is the intensity of creation and power, if you know this, then say, as for the first face, it is necessary for the meant to be the intensity The intended is the same as the crocodile, and the one that is only intended to be the last, and that the meant is all of that.As for the first: He said it: The human being created in a luxury, that is: we created all the phases of severity and hardship, tired in the stomach of the mother, then the time of the breastfeeding, then the time of the breasts, then the time The pension, then after that death.As for the second: It is the age in religion, the good said: The thank you for the secrets, and the patience of the harm, and the advertisement is sufficient in the performance of worship.As for the third: it is the last, the dead and the king of the king and the darkness of the grave, then the resurrection and the presentation to God until the decision is settled in it either in paradise or in the fire.As for the four: It is the preserved, the preserved on all, the truth.And I have another face in it: that it is not in this worldly unjust, but rather it is thought that it is a pleasure, so it is a salvation from the pain, for what is the one who is absent from Salvation with the pain of hunger, and what It is imagined from the pleasure at the dress, so it is a salvation from the mother of freedom and the cold, so there is no human being except for a mother or a salvation from a mother and a transfer to another, so this is the meaning of our meaning: A person is in a luxury and it appears from him that a person must be for the resurrection and resurrection, because the wise who managed to create the creation of the human being, if he is required of him, then he does not With mercy, even if he is required to be nor a pleasure, then he left it on the nomadic as a sufficiency in this aspiration, and if it is required, he will be in.This life is pleasant, and that he created the human being in this worldly world in luxury, hardship and insulting, so then this house must be then from another house, for the house of the house, Coasts, delights and dignity.As for the second direction: It is that the luxury is explained by the level of leveling, and Ibn Abbas said: With this creation.As for the third direction: it is to explain the strictness of the creation.The old Adim al -Okhari, so that they lie from it under his feet, so he torn the ancient and did not go away, and know that the one who is the one is the first.(P-166)
