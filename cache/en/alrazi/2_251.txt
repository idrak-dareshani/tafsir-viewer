The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: He defeated them with the permission of God and killed David Golot, and God has brought him the king The earth, but God is a preference for the two worlds: that God Almighty has answered their supplication, and he emptied the patience for them, and they have proven their feet, and they will be blessed with the righteousness And his soldiers and achieved his preference and his mercy, who said: How many categories are a few who prevailed in a many categories with the permission of God, so they defeated them and defeated them with the sake of God.The fracture is said to be defeated if it suffers from a drought, and I defeat the bone or the reed defeat, and the defeat is a click in the mountain, or in the rocks, he said in the shack Zamzam: It is the defeat of Gabriel, who wants to defeat it with his man, and he broke the water, and it is said: I heard the defeat of the pursuit as if it is a voice in it, and it is a distress, Because he is cracked by the rain, defeated the roll, and his defeat is what is broken from it, then he told the Almighty that that defeat was with the permission of God, and his goodness, And that if not for his help and his facilitation, he would not have come to the time, then he said: David Jalut killed the son of Abbas, may God be pleased with them: that David is upon him and peace be upon him, and he was the one who has been upon him and peace be upon him.A brother with Taltout, when he slowed the news of his brother on their father, I didn’t send his son, Dawid to them, to bring him with their news, so they came to them while they were in the righteousness and they were in the righteousness and they were in the righteousness of the He returned to the stool, and he did not come out to him, and he said: O sons of Israel, if you were in the right of my family, so he said, so he said to his brothers?So they were silent, and he went to the side of the row in which he was not his brother, and he passed through him, and he was inciting people, so Dawood said to him: What do you do with this?And I said: I marry him, my son, and I give him half of my king, and David said: I am coming out to him and his habit is to fight with the lord of the wolf, and the lord was in With his glorification, when they were David that he would come out, and he wounded him in his chest, and the stone executed in it, and he was killed after many people, so he defeated the gall of God Jalot, his envy of Taltout, and brought him out of his kingdom, and he did not fulfill him with his promise, then he regretted, so he went to ask him until he was killed, and the king of David, He gathered in the children of the kingdom of the king and the prophecy except for him.Know that his saying: So they defeated them with the permission of God and killed David Golut, indicating that the defeat of Askar Jalut was from Taltout, and if he was killed, he was not killed Dahir that the commitment of the sugar was before the killing of Galot or after it, because the waw does not benefit the trait.* * * (p-166 God, the king and the prophecy, is a reward for what he did from the great obedience, and the soul of the soul in the path of God, with the fact that he was a scholar of that he is good for the good It is not forbidden to make her a reward for obedience as he said: And we have chosen them on the knowledge of the two worlds and we came to them from the verses in which there is a clear way [the smoke: 32, 33] His message [Al -Anam: 124] and the appearance of this verse also indicates that; Because he was exalted when he told David that he had killed Golot, he said after him: And God gave him the king, wisdom, and the authority, if he was blessed with some of his servants, who are the slaves of those who did.It is suspicious that that public for the sake of that servitude, and the most said: The prophecy is not permissible to make it a penalty on the works, but that is the one It is chosen by the angels with messengers and from people [Hajj: 75].The second question: Some of them said: The revelation of the verse indicates that Dawood was killed when Golot was killed by God, the king and the Prophet, and that is because he is the Almighty.Aqeeb his remembrance to kill David Golot, and the ruling on the description of the appropriateness is a sense of that, as the description is a cause for the sake of this Peace, when he killed the same, the great characteristic of the frying and the stone, that was a miracle, not, and the stones have been suspended with it, and he said: So the miracle appears to be denied by the Prophet, but the king is because the people did not witness from it that the great enemy is the vigilant, so that the work is not, so the work of the little is the work It is inclined to him, and that requires the king to be apparent.The most of the people said: The arrival of the king and the prophecy is delayed from that time by seven years on what the laughter said, they said: And the narrations are that they said: Ain Taltout for the king, so he will be isolated from the king in the state of his life, and the most famous in the conditions of the children of Israel.Ashmlil is fulfilled, God has given the transgression of the Prophet, and when I died, God gave God to the king to Dadd, and the king gathered in it.The third question: the rule: it is the place of things, its positions on the right and the righteousness, and the fullness of this meaning is that it is obtained by the prophecy, so it is not the same The prophecy, the Almighty said: Or do they envy people on what God has given them from his grace, then the family of the book and the ruling came to us and we have a great king: [54] Peace be upon him: He teaches them the book and wisdom [Al -Imran: 164].If it was said: If the wise of the prophecy is, then the king is presented On wisdom?With the king, the king is instead of the prophecy.We said: Because God Almighty has shown in this verse as how the peace be upon him, peace be upon him, to the high levels, and if the one speaks to the one who spoke in the way of what was Relax in remembrance was up and greater.As for his words, he said: He taught him what he creates in his face and faces: one of them: that what is meant by what he mentioned in his saying: We taught him to make it to you, for you to make you 80] And he said: And we have the unicorn to him that he works as sacrifices and appreciated in the narration [Saba: 10, 11].And the second: that what is meant is the words of the bird and the slaughter, he said a story about it: He taught us the brightness of the bird [Al -Naml: 16].(P-161) and its third: that what is meant by what is related to the validity of the world and the king of the king, is what the king inherited from his fathers, because they were not bored, but they were sponsored.And the one who has been: the knowledge of religion, the Almighty said: And we came to Dawood Zabur [Women: 163] and that was because he was a ruling among people, so it is necessary and that God knows best.Fifth: The good melodies, and the sacred lamb is not distant from all.If it was said: It is upset when he mentioned that the wisdom gave him, and it was intended to rule the prophecy, so the knowledge entered in that, and he did not mention what he did.We said: The intended from the alerts is that the servant is a cat that does not end up with a state that seeks me from learning, whether he was a prophet or was not, and for this, he said: Lord, more knowledge [Taha: 114] Then he said: If only God had to pay people, some of them were spoiled.Know that he was upset when he indicated that the corruption that occurred in the sides and his soldiers was removed from what was from Taltout and his soldiers, and what was from David from the killing of Galle Displacement in this section, which is that it is the highness of the people with some of them, so that you do not spoil the land, so he said: And if only the people will pay the people with some of them, some of them are the same Institutions: The first question: Ibn Kathir and Abu Amr read, and if not to pay God with a thousand thousand, as well He defends those who believed in) with a thousand thousand, and they agreed with them, and Hamza, and Al -Kisa’i and Ibn Amir Al -Yahsbi to pay God without a thousand Those who believed in a thousand, and read a bonus (without God’s defense), and God is defending the thousand.If you know these narratives, then say: As for those who read: (If not for the payment of God), (God is defending), then he will face it, and the one who has read: On those who believe in the face of the forms in which the defense is a reaction, and it is a phrase of the universe of each one of the beneficiaries, a motivation for his companion, and for his companion One of the servants is in the right of God a referred to a referred, and his answer is that the people of the language have two sayings of two sayings: one of them: that it is a source of defending, saying: She says: I wrote it as a book and a book, they said: A lot of acts come as a source of the three of the actions and do, you say: Glory be to the glimpse, and the aspiration of the aspiration, and to say: For a meeting, I rose up, and on this interpretation, his saying was: (Without God’s motivation), it was meaning, and if God did not pay.And the second saying: the saying of those who made (a defensive) from a motivation, for the meaning is that it is the one who is the oppression and the disobedience from the injustice And it was between those who are right and those who are invalidated by defenders and bonuses, so the news is good for him to say the defense, as he said: He said: He said: Grandfather of God [Al -Anfal: 13] and he said: God fought them [At -Tawbah: 30] and his principles, and God knows.The second question: Know that it is a male in this verse that is buried and buried with it, so he said it: If only the payment of God, the people of the people, and the people of the people, (With some) referring to the buried with it, but the buried for it is not mentioned in the verse.On the authority of the world, it is enticed to be their group.(P-162) As for the first section: that the buried is the evil in the debt, so the evil is either that the reference is to it to the infidels, or to the immoral These are the numbers.The first indifference: that the meaning will be: and if God does not pay some people from disbelief in the cause Those who prevent people from the fall in the infidels by the convergence of evidence, the proofs, and the sons.And the second indifference: that the intended will be: and if God did not pay some people from sins and deeds in the cause With the well -being, and the forbidding of the denial of what the Almighty said: You were the best of a nation that was brought out to people, who were commanded by the well -known and forbidden from this: The imams who are informed by God Almighty for the sake of the residence of the limits and the purification of the rituals of Islam, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: Pay the one who is the most desirable [96] Another position: and they are seen by the good good [Al -Raad: 22].The third talisman: If only God, some people are driven by the people, and the excitement of sedition in the world in the cause Peace be upon them, then the imams And those who are diligent on their parts, and his reports: that the one person can not live alone, because he did not bother this, and this is not for that, and this is not for that, and this is not for that, and this is not for that, and this is not for that.And that is not weaved for this, the one -human reconciliation is not fulfilled, and only when the meeting of a group is fulfilled in one position, then this was said: the human being is a debt Consency due to the dispute that leads to the first of the militia, and the second fighting, so the divine wisdom must be made from a project between the creation, for the sake of the creation, for the sake of the part For the rituals and rituals, the Prophet, peace be upon them, who have been given from God with this bitter who are the ones who paid God with the grace of God As long as the creation, the creation remains, they are holding the parts, and there is no suffering between them and no conflue She was a girl, and the reconciliation is a habit, and it appeared that God Almighty deposits the believers of the types of worldly mourning in the cause of the mission of the Prophet.And know that it is not necessary to cut the chapters and disputes from the project, so therefore it is necessary to implement the project from the king, and this is why the prayers and peace be upon him.Tawamman also said: “Islam is a prince, and the Sultan is hot, so what is not for him is a defeat, and what is not hot is not for him, so he is lost.” The world of the world is caused by setting the bouquets and due to the installation of the crocodile and their strength, and whoever says this saying, he said in the interpretation of his saying: The people of the earth killing and sins, and that is called a corruption.In the evening, you only want to be a mighty in the land and what you want to be among the righteous [Al -Qasas: 19] and he said: I am afraid that you will replace your debt or that it will be in the land of the corruption: Moses and his people have caused to be corrupted in the land [Al -A'raf: 127] and he said: Corruption appeared in righteousness and sea with what the hands of people have earned [Al -Rum: 41] and this is the one who is in the way of it.Hajj: If only God would pay some of them with some of them, I would have gone, and the sales, and the prayers and mosques [Hajj: 40].The fourth of the fool: If not the payment of God with the believers and the righteous from the infidels and the jaws, the earth would not be spoiled and destroyed by (p-163) in it, and this is what He said: “It is pushed with those who prayed from my nation who does not pray, and whoever is zakat on those who do not pay zakat, and whoever fasts with those who do not fast, and whoever does not do the one who does not I face, and if they gathered on the leaving of these things, God would not look at them.The Messenger of God ﷺ is followed by this verse “on the validity of this saying from the Qur’an.Their father is righteous [Al -Kahf: 82] and the Almighty said: If not for the believers and the believers of the believers [Al -Fath: 25] to his saying: If they were permissible, they would not be tormented by those who are the one who is disbelieving: God was to torture them, and you are in them [Al -Anfal: 33] And whoever said this saying, he said in the interpretation of his saying: The earth is spoiled, that is, the family of God, for the family of God.And the fifth talisman: that the memorizer is the one who is based on all, because among these sections is a blessed destiny, which is the payment of spoiling, then if we carry the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake With her family in it.
