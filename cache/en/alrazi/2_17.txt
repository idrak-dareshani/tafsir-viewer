The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: The same as the same as the one who lost a fire.The interpretation of the conservation of this verse is speaking in two things: one of them: that the intended is the harm of the proverbs that it affects the hearts that does not affect it and the description of the thing; That is because the excess of the example is the hidden to the righteous, and the absence of the witness, and the essence is sure of what it is, and the sense becomes a good thing The end of the clarification, not to see that the desire if it falls into faith is inventory of the example of a proverb for him, and his fell in the heart is not confirmed in the heart, as he will make sure that he will be confirmed, and if it is confirmed, then he will be sure of it The infidelity is the masculinity of the masculinity, and its ugliness is not sure of the minds, as it is confirmed if it is represented by the shadow That was the most beautiful in the report of his image from the news with his weakening, and this is the most exalted, and this is the most exalted in his book shown and in the man of his books, and he said: We are setting it to people [Al -Anakbout: 43] and from the illusion of the surahs of the omissions, and in the verse the questions: the first question: the proverb in the origin of their words in the meaning of the one who is the same, which is the same, which is the same And an example and an analogy, likeness, likeness, and youth, and then it was said to the saying of the wicked, the representative of his hearts: an example, and his condition is that it is a saying of it Some faces.(P-67) The second question: It is up to the right of the attitudes of the hypocrites, with a harmful, likely to increase in the revelation and Bayan.One of them: this is the example and has problems.One of it: to be said: What is the face of the representative of those who have been given a light, then the light is robbed of it with it with the fact that the hypocrisy does not have a light?.And the second: that it is said: Whoever loses a fire and lit a little, then he benefited from it and its light, then it is forbidden, but the hypocrites do not benefit from it.Examination?.And the third of it: that the verse of the fire has gained the same light, and God Almighty went with his light and left it in darkness, and the hypocrisy is not the same And the puzzle has come in it before itself, so what is the similarity?.The answer: that the scholars mentioned in the way of the likeness of it: one of them: Al -Saddi said: People entered Islam when he was prayed upon him, peace be upon him, and they will be upon them.And the likeness is here in the end of health; Because by their faith, they earned a light, then their spending, secondly, they preceded that light and falling into great life, so it is not a reward of the breeze of the religion; Because the confused is in his way for the sake of injustice, only the few are lost from the world.The two eternity.And secondly: If the Saddy said, but they were ever, they were ever.They disappeared with the right of their blood and the peace of their money from the spoil and their children from the captivity, and they blew with the riches of jihad and the rulings of the rulings of the Muslim, The lights of faith, and when that was in addition to the permanent torment, you appreciated their likeness to the verse of the fire, which was used to the light of it, then a few, then the authority of it, then it is so And his escape of the darkness that came to him in the aftermath of the light, so he was walking in the world in the world, likening the light, and the greatness of their harm in the hereafter.And the third of it: to say: the face of the suspicion is not that the hypocrisy has a light, but rather the face of the suspicion with this standard that the light is still from it, and the light is still from it.Light, then it is more severe than that of the path of the way in a dark injustice, but it is the highest of the light in the veiled of the fire, so that it is true that it is true that it is true.Hardy, not that the analogy is the gathering of light and darkness.And the one who has been subjected to it: that those who showed him are delusional that it is from the light of the light that he benefits from, and the light of the light is what appears to him for his loved ones from the disbelief and hypocrisy, and who said that he said that he said: On his saying: And if they met those who believed, they said, “We believed in us, and if they were given to their teeth, they said that we are with you, then the fire is an example for their saying:“ We believed in them.” For atonement: “We are with you.” If it is said: How does what appear to be the hypocrisy of the word of faith, for example, with light, and when you speak to it, it is a condemnation?We said that if he had been destroyed to the saying, he would be able to do it and do it, the light would not have the light for himself, but he did not do it, he did not fulfill his light, but he was called.Because he is a true saying of himself.Fifth: It is permissible for the fire to be a expressive of the hypocrisy of the word of faith, but rather he called it a light because it decorates it with its appearance in it and it is in it.While between them, then God is the Almighty, that lights with that light with you will be the one who agrees with the definition of his Prophet and the believers, the truth of his command, so he is the same From the name of faith, he remained in darkness that does not see, as the light that he had before God revealed his command is still.And its sixth: that when they were described as the misguidance of the guidance, they followed this with this representation to represent their guidance, which he sold the light, the light, the light, the light, the light, what is the light, And the delusion that they bought and printed on their hearts with the fear of God with their light and left them in darkness.And its sake: It is permissible for you to be lost.It is likened by the temptation that tried the farmers with this fire.A fire for war, which God has brought it [Al -Maaidah: 64].And the eighth: Said bin Jabir said: It came down in the Jews (P-68) and waiting for them to the exit of the Messenger of God ﷺ and conquer them with it, and they are the one who has been blessed with it.He was waiting for them to Muhammad ﷺ as the fire of fire, and their disbelief in him after his appearance as the ritual of that light.The third question: As for the faith of the light and the infidelity of the darkness, it is in the book of God a lot of high The pilgrimage and to the way of the good and the removal of the life, and this is the state of faith in the chapter of religion, so what is the end in the removal of life and the goods of the one who is in the door of the religion, and what is in the chapter of the debt in the chapter of religion The saying in the analogy of the infidels to the darkness; Because the one who is lost from the way that needs his hearts is not returned to him from the causes of deprivation and the restriction is greater than injustice, and nothing is like that in the chapter of religion, the greatest أحَدَهُما بِالآخَرِ, فَهَذا هو الكَلامُ فِيما هو المَقْصُودُ الكُلِّيُّ مِن هَذِهِ الآيَةِ, بَقِيَتْ هَهُنا أسْئِلَةٌ وأجْوِبَةٌ تَتَعَلَّقُ بِالتَّعَلُّقِ بِالتَّفاصِيلِ: السُّؤالُ الأوَّلُ: قَوْلُهُ Exalted: The same is the same as the one who lost a fire that requires it like them like the one Another?.The answer is: The proverb is rented for the story or for the clause if it has an affair and a stranger in it, as if it was said: The miracle cut them as a story that is the one who said: The example of the paradise that the righteous promised [Al -Ra`dah: 35], meaning that we have a miracle of the wonders of the miracle of the miraculous paradise, and God is the highest.A matter of greatness and majesty, the same in the mourning [Al -Fattah: 29], that is, their description and their arrogance, and the like, and from the same meaning of the western, they said: They missed a row from him.The second question: How did the group like the one?.The answer is from his faces: one of them: that it is permissible in the language and put the “who“ put ”those who“ say it ”: and you are like those who fought [the repentance: 69], but it is permissible; Because “who“ for his formation and a link to the description of every acquaintance is beautiful, and a lot of his fall in their words, and for his formation, he is involved in his ritual, so he is a ritual They raised it by deletion, and they delete his J, then break it, and then they confused in it on the mother and alone in the names of the actors and the actors.And the second: that the intended is the seed of the one who is critical, or I want the gathering or the frog, which was driven by fire.And the third: It is the strongest: that The hypocrites and their deeds were not likened to the same standard until it is necessary for the group to be likened to it.And the same is the saying of the Almighty: the example of those who carried the teeth, then they did not carry it like the likes of life [Al -Jumaa: 5] and his saying: They look at you The death [Muhammad: 20].And its elevation: the meaning: the same is the same as one of them as its saying: it brings you a ritual [Ghaffir: 67], meaning that each one comes out.The third question: What is the new fuel?What is the fire?What is the light?What is the light?What is dark?.Answer: As for the boundaries of the fire, it is its power and the integrity of its flame.Because there is a movement and a compelling movement, and the light is derived from it and it is its light, and the mark is the light, and the light is the thing that is authorized to it.It is also said to the thing that is the rhinker on it, and it is the light because it purifies the body and light And the moon is a light [Yunus: 5] and “lighting” he responds to a need and an aggressor, says: The moon lit the darkness, and the moon lit up in the sense of lighting, the poet said: P-69) The night is until the severity of the severity, and the one around the thing is what he connects to it, and it is said about it, and it is the one who connects to it.The covenant, that is, you change, and if his collar, it changes his color, and the transformer of the right of the right from one person to a person, and the one who asked for the verb after that, then he did not see that he did not.And the impermissibility of the eyes, and the conversion, God Almighty said: They do not want about it around it [Al -Kahf: 108] and the darkness is the light The language is alarm about the two shortcomings.The right of the suspicion, and the shadow of the ritual; Because it is immersed quickly, and the shadow is the water of the tooth, its cruisers, and its whiteness, similar to it by the ghost.The loyal question: a richness of a transcendent or not?The answer: Both of them are permissible.In transcendent, and it is necessary to be other than an aggressor who is based on what is around it and the insult to the bearer in the sense; Because what is around the one who is lying in place and things, and the reader of Ibn Abi Abla “Dhi”.The fifth question: Is it said that God is gone with their brightness?To say: When did you light?Answer: The male of the light is the most beautiful; Because the light has a sign of the increase, even if it was said: God went with their groans, and they are the one who went to the gossip and the survival of what is called light, And the imposition is the removal of the light from them in the kidney, not to see how it is mentioned by its obstacle: and left them in darkness that they do not see and the darkness is a dilemma of the light of the light, and how is it?How do we deny it?And how to follow it that indicates that it is a pure injustice, and it is his saying: they do not see?.The sixth question: Why did he say: God gave their light and did not say God gave their light?And the answer: The difference is between it, and he went with it that the meaning of his glow removed it and made it going, and it is said: He went with him if he accompanied him, and he said with him, and he said: When they went to him [Yusuf: 15], then all God gone was gone with what was created [the believers: 91] and the meaning God took their light and hold him and what he is touched, then he did not.From the darkening and read al -Yammani, “God gave their light.” The following question: What is the meaning of [and left them]?And the answer: It is left if it is suspended with a limit, then it is in the sense of a hurt, and if it is suspended with two things, it was in the sense of a good, and it will run a pilgrimage of the hearts of the hearts and the one who has said it in it: Then he entered “left”, so the part set.The eighth question: Why did one who do not see?The answer: It is from the one who is the one who is not satisfied with his notification of mind, not from the one who is able, as if the verb is not in origin.Deafness is blind, and an understanding does not come back to the Almighty saying: a deafness is a blind heart, so they do not return (P-70).And they see the bearing of that to the truth, and they did not only resemble their condition for the severity And what the Messenger shows from the evidence and the verses of those who are deaf in the truth, then he does not hear, and if he does not hear, he would not be able to answer, then he will make him.With evidence and did not see the way of adults, then it is the veil of the blind, but he said: They do not seek refuge in his faces and faces: one of them: that they do not return Holding the hypocrisy that is for the sake of their contact with it and God Almighty described them with these attributes, so that there is a sign of that they are over.And the second: that they do not return to the guidance after they sold it, and from the misguidance after they bought it.And the third of it: He wanted that they are in the home of the beyond those who remained dormant in their place, and they are not happy, and they do not realize, or they are delayed?How do they return to where they start from it?.
