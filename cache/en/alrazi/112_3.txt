The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: He did not give birth to him and did not give birth to him: The first question: Why was he said: He did not give birth to his saying: And he did not give birth to him Molly, then the father is?The answer: The Badaa was not born; Because they claimed that he had a son, and that is because the Arabs of the Arabs said: The angels are the daughters of God, and the Judy said, the son of the son of God, and the Christians said: He has the father, for this reason, he began with the most important, and he said: He did not give birth, then he referred to the pilgrimage, and he said: And he was not born as if it was said: The evidence is on the abuse of the parents.Other than him.The second question: Why did he confine the remembrance of the past, and he said: He did not give birth and did not say: He will not be born?The answer: Rather, he was confined to that, because he was answered by answers to their saying, God, and evidence is upon him, saying: “They are not from their dismantling to God.” [151] The intended of this verse is a lie of their saying, and they said that in the past, and there is no crime and the verse was returned to his saying.The third question: Why did he say: He did not give birth and said in Surah Bani Asriil: And he did not take a son [Al -Israa: 111]?The answer: that the child is on two parts: one of them: to generate his ideals from him, and this is the true birth.The second: that it is not generated from him, but he takes him a son and calls him this name, and if he is not a son in the truth, and the Christians are the one who said: And among them is those who said: God took him as a son of his honor, as Abraham was taken as a good manner for him, so he said: He did not give him a sign of the nose of the nose of the nose of the country, And he said: He did not take a sign of a sign to the negative of the second section, and for this he said: He did not take a child and he had no partner in the king because the human being has been taken.And with him on the one who is required, and for that he said in another surah: They said that God took a son of his grace is the rich [Yunus: 68] and referring to what we mentioned to take the mother.The fourth question: the exile of its exalted, the father and the mother, is it possible to know with the hearing or not, and if it is not possible for that, then what is the same?Answer: He denied the extent of its Lord, and the father is benefiting from the knowledge that it is not in the body, no one, no one, or division, and the exile of its exaltation is the one who is the same The exalted as an evaluation, and the knowledge of each of these two prayers is presented to the knowledge of the prophecies and the Qur’an, so we cannot be benefited from the evidence, It is said: When they did not benefit from the hearing, what is the benefit in their remembrance in this surah?We said: We have indicated that what is meant is from He is one of his people, his soul in himself and his essence, which is out of all the parts of the calamities, and his exalted, the highness of his name, as it is the same as the one who has the same Self and all his attributes, and if it is like that, the one and the name are the denial of the birth of the parent (P-169) and the Mawlidiya, so when the reason was mentioned, the obligatory is the obligatory And the Mawlidiya, the male of these two rules, the intended one of their remembrances is the alert of God Almighty to the mentality of the hedge of their seizure.The fifth question: Is it in his saying: He did not give birth and did not give birth to more than the denial of the parents and the denial of the state?We said: It contains many benefits, and that is because his saying: (God is one) is a sign of his exalted in the same in himself and what he is in the authority of his soul نَفْيِ الأضْدادِ والأنْدادِ والشُّرَكاءِ والأمْثالِ, وهَذانَ المَقامانِ الشَّرِيفانِ مِمّا حَصَلَ الِاتِّفاقُ فِيهِما بَيْنَ أرْبابِ المِلَلِ والأدْيانِ, وبَيْنَ الفَلاسِفَةِ, إلّا أنَّ مِن بَعْدِ هَذا المَوْضِعِ The disagreement obtained between the boredom and between the philosophers, because the spoils said: It is generated by the obligation of the existence of the mind, and the mind is the mind, and the mind is the mind, On this path, until it ends up to the mind that is the mastermind of the moon, so on this saying, it will be the obligation of the provision that the son of the mind is the first one, The mind that is the mastermind of our scholars is like this one of the minds that he is on the authority of it, so the truth is his pursuit and the exile of the parents, as if it is, as if it is: The minds and the souls, then he said: The thing that is the mastermind of your bodies and your souls and your world is not a newborn from something other Glory to him.
