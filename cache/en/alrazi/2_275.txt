The Second Holding Researcher: One of the legal rulings mentioned in this position from this surah is the ruling of usury: those who eat usury are only the same The Satan is disturbed by touching that they said, but the sale is like usury, and God is the best of sale and the deprivation of usury, so whoever comes to him is a preaching of his Lord, then he will not be.For those who are the people of the fire, they are in it, they are the Almighty saying: Those who eat usury do not do only as they are the one who disappointed by the Satan, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the Satan that he said Like usury, God has permitted the sale and forbade usury, so whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord, so he ended, so he has what he preceded and commanded him to God and whoever returns, for those who are the people And between the charity is a suitable one on the one hand, and that is because the charity is a expressive of the sake of money (P-75) due to the command of God with that, and the Lord is a good thing about the Lord of the money God is about him, and we were oppressed, and this is why God Almighty said: God will inform the usury and raise the charity, so when he obtained these two things, this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The wisest of the ruling of the ruling of usury.As for his saying: Those who eat usury, what is meant by those who treat it, and the most prolonged because he is the greatest thing It is permissible to eat the money of the Yatim, and it is not permissible to destroy it, but he alerted the eating of what it is, and so he said: Do not eat your money between you with the ritual of you: [188] The soul of the usurc, which is the increase in money on what they were doing in the ignorance, is not eaten, but it is spent in the food, so it is eaten, and it is intended to be narrated in it.The usury is what we mentioned from the return, and also, it has been proven that ﷺ: Over also, it has been proven by the testimony of the parcel and the opposite, that what is forbidden does not stop its prohibition on the most without it other than the fragments, so it is the same The abundance of usury in this verse is the behavior of usury, and the usury has the books: the first question: the Lord in the language is a phrase of the Ziyah, it is said: the Lord of the thing is the one who says: She was divided and raised [Hajj: 5], that is, she increased, and the man is raised if he treated in usury, and from the hadith ““ Whoever answers, then he has been raised.His goodness, this is the meaning of usury in the language.The second question: Reading Hamza and Al -Kisae “Al -Rabbiya” with the hope of being the breaking of the Arabs and the rest of the foolishness with the opening of the b A choice in her writing with a thousand, wow and ya.You like the gathering.* * * The third question: Know that usury is a person: the Lord of the humanity, and the Lord of the best.As for the god of women, it is the matter that was a famous manifestation in the ignorance, and that they were paying money on the money that they took every month of an estimated amount of money, The rest, then if the debtle comes to seeks the debts with the heads of money, then if the performance is excused, they have increased the right and the sake of the right, for this is the usury that they were in the ignorance.As for the goddess of criticism, it is that it is sold from the stomachs with two meanings of it and what is like that.If you know this, then say: The narrator is from Ibn Abbas that he was only forbidden by the first section, and he would say: There is no interest except in the human being, and he was permissible for him, and he was permissible for him.Al -Khadri: I witnessed what I did not testify, or I heard from the Messenger of God ﷺ I did not hear.Then it was narrated that he returned from him, “Muhammad ibn Sirin said: We were in a house and with us Akramah, and a man said: O Akrama, what you remember in the authority of us Abbas, so he said: I was decomposing the expression of my opinion, then he rich me that he ﷺ forbade him, so they testified that I deprived him of him and died from him to God.His saying: And God is the greatness of the sale, and the sale of the dirhams is in charge of their dorm A forbidden, but his saying: He prohibited usury, but the belief is given the special that was called among them that it is a Lord, and that is the Lord of the one who said: The usury is specialized in the human being, and it has proven that his saying: And God is the good of the sale, and the Lord of the criticism is destroyed.It can be said: It is deprived of it (P-76) with the hadith, because it requires the disclosure of the phenomenon of the Qur’an with the news of the one and that it is not permissible, and this is the son Recalling that the Qur’an is devoted to the news of one, is it permissible or not?As for the jurisdiction of the Mujahidin, they agreed on the prohibition of usury in the two divisions.The goddess of criticism in the six things, then they disagreed, and the general jurisprudence said: The deprivation is defined on it and the argument of these faces: the first pilgrimage: that the street is special from the essences, the restaurants, and the signs of four things, so if it was the same Or in every The vaccinations said: Do not sell the supply of the deposit, or he said: Do not sell the vaccinated with the holidays, virtuously, for this words are more severe, He did not say that, but the four of the four, we know that the ruling of the sanctity is short of it.The second pilgrimage: I have shown that his saying is up to the Almighty: And God is the same thing that requires the dissolution of the user of the criticism, so you have been brought out by the intention of the criticism from the one who is in this way.Then the sanctity was proven, otherwise it was a measure of it, so this was a specialization for the general text of the Qur’an in the six of the six of the news of the one, and in others, and other than the one who is the one who is the same The judgment has proven in it with the news of one, and the same is this measurement, the most weakened with a lot of the news of the one, and the news of the one weakened from the phenomenon of the Qur’an, so this was the same.The strongest, and it is not permissible.The third pilgrimage: that the transgression is from the place of the text to the other place of the text, it is not possible only by the mediation It requires the reasons for the ruling of God, and that is referred to what you have proven in the origins, and secondly: because the judgment is in the mourning of the text, it is known, and the language is a matter With the suspects, it is not permissible, and the jurisprudence was brought up, they agreed on the fact that the prohibition of the criticism is not short of these things, but it is the same Then it is known that it is not possible to do the ruling on the place of the text until other than the place For this meaning, they disappeared in the cause on the doctrine.The first saying: It is the gold of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him: that the cause is in the prohibition of usury.And the second saying: The saying of Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him: that everything was estimated in his rabbit, and the cause in the Dahrim and the wanders of the adulterer, and in the things of the fourth.The third saying: the saying of the Malik, may God be pleased with him, is that the cause is the power or what is reconciled with the power, which is salt.And the righteous saying: It is the saying of Abd al -Malik ibn al -Mujashun: that everything that is beneficial to it is in the interests of the Lord The questions are not appropriate for interpretation.* * * The following question: they mentioned the reason for the deprivation of usury and its faces: one of them: the usury requires taking the money of the human being without compensation, because whoever sells the darkening Or a human being, and he will have the increase in their dirham from other than a compensation, and the money of man (P-77) is attached to his need and has a great sanctity, he said ﷺ: His blood, “So he must take his money from other than a majestic compensation.If it was said: Why is it not permissible for the meeting of the head of money in his hand for a period of time, a dedicated time?That is because the head of money, if he remained in his hand, is this period, it was possible for money to be traded in it and benefited from the reason for that trader, so that it is a good.The debts and the bloggers did not benefit from it, and it is not far from the Lord of money.We said: This is the integrity that you mentioned is a matter that may get and may not get, and I take the increased darkening, so it is a time The dictator is not reluctant to the type of harm.And the second: Some of them said: God is exalted, but he forbade usury from where he prevents people from being preoccupied with the attributes, and that is because the owner of the dar is the one who is in the authority The extension of the extension of the decrease is a critical or a human being who has been reluctant to receive the face of the living, so he hardly carries the hardship of gain and the merchants, and the mankind, and the mankind, and the commercials, and the commercials, It leads to the transmission of the benefits of creation, and it is known that the world's reconciliation does not remain except with trading, letters, industries and buildings.And the third of it: It was said: The reason for the prohibition of the contract of usury is that it is led to the decay of the known between the people from the loan, because the usury, if the souls are kind to the sake Likewise, and if the usury would have been the need for the need, it would take it to take their dirhams with two dirhams, so that it is led to the fatigue, the well -known.And its elevation: is that the majority is that the loan is a rich, and the assessed is a chapter, so the saying is the permissibility of the contract of the usury, it is a place for the sinner from the one who is the one The weak is an increased money, and that is not permissible with the mercy of the Most Merciful.Fifth: that the prohibition of usury has been proven by the text, and it is not obligatory for the wisdom of all the intelligence to be known to the creation, so the cutting is obligatory.We know the face in it.As for the saying of the Exalted: they do not stand up, so the most interpreters said: What is meant by him is the day of resurrection, and some of them said: What is meant by the grave is from the grave, and he knows that he does not know Al -Wajih, so it is obligatory to carry the memorial to them.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Except as the one who hits the Satan from touching, then he is in the following: The man who is disgraced in an order and does not guide him: He touches the clash of a rah.Because it is like a stirring on the other hand, and the injury of the Satan is called the madness and the fabrication, and it is said: It has a slander of the madness, and the touches of the madness, and it is said: مُسَّ الرَّجُلُ فَهو مَمْسُوسٌ وبِهِ مَسٌّ, وأصْلُهُ مِنَ المَسِّ بِاليَدِ, كَأنَّ الشَّيْطانَ يَمَسُّ الإنْسانَ فَيُجِنَّهُ, ثُمَّ سُمِّيَ الجُنُونُ مَسًّا, كَما أنَّ الشَّيْطانَ يَتَخَبَّطُهُ And his legs turn it on, and he will be hidden.Be a transcendent?The answer: You act in the sense of a lot, so that it will be divided in the sense of its division, and cut it in the sense of its cutting.The second question: What did his saying comment: Who is touching?(P-78) We said: It is in it and the merits of one of them: by saying that they do not stand up and appreciate: they do not rise from the touch that they have only as they are the one who makes it wrong.The second: It is attached to his saying (it is) and the ability: they only stand as the disappointment is caused by touching.The second question: Al -Jubai said: People say the confusing, but it spoke to that case; Because the Satan touches it and holds it, and this is false; Because the Satan is weak, it is not appreciated by the people of the people and their killing, and it is indicated by its face So you answered me [Ibrahim: 22], and this is clear that it is not a destiny for the sake, the killing, and the abuse.The second: The Satan is either said: It is a thick body, or it is said: It is one of the gentle bodies, then if the first is, he must be seen and witnessed, if it is permissible for it to be so It is not considered that we are in our presence, numbers, pursuit, burdens, and camels, and we do not see it, and that is a great ignorance; Because if it was a thick body, how can he enter the body of the body of the human being, but if it is a gentle body like the air, then this is the same, so this is the same.Strengthening, so it is forbidden to be a luminous person to swore and kill the human being.The third: If the Satan would be able to swore and kill it, he would do the same as the miracles of the prophet, upon whom the prayer and peace be upon them.The lord: that the Satan if he is able to do so, why would all the believers roll and why he does not make them tied with the severity of his hostility to the people of faith, and the people of faith, and the people of faith, and the people of faith, and the people of faith, and the people of faith They spoil their conditions, spread their secrets, and remove their minds?And all of that is the phenomenon of corruption, and those who say that the Satan is appreciated by these things in Jahin: The first: What was narrated is that the devils are in the time They were doing the hard work of what God told them that they were doing what he was giving from the incest, and the furniture and eyelids like the answer and the fate of heads.The answer to it: that it was the highest of them in the time of Soloman, so that they were able to do these actions and that was from the miracles of Solomon, peace be upon him.The second: that this verse is its saying: the Satan is sworn by it that the Satan is wrong with it.And the answer to it: that the Satan touches it with the harmful bosses that it occurs at it.P Because God Almighty created him from the weakness of the class, and the dominance of the pole is upon him, where he is afraid of the boss, so he does not arise, and he will be seized by the one who is so and who is the one who will be blessed.The empty position, and this meaning is not found in the full virtue of the two and the people of the belief and the mind, but there is a deficiency in the mood and the heart in the brain in the brain, so in the heart of this This section, and the lock mentioned in it another face, which is that people add the rugs to the Satan and to the Jin Something to add it to the Satan, as in the words of His Excellency: He looked at it as if the heads of demons [Saffat: 65].The third question: For those who are interpreters in the verse, sayings: The first: that I eat usury sends the day of the resurrection, and that is like the flag of the one who is the one who is the same The standing of this mark is that it is the most important of the world, so this is the meaning of (P-79) the verse: that they are crazy, as the Satan has been afflicted with two sons.And the second saying: The son of a alarm said: He wants if the people are sent from their graves, they came out wrestling with his saying that they come out of the juveniles as an acceleration: They are standing and falling, as the one who hides the Satan from touching, and that is because they have eaten usury in the world, so God raised him in the day of the day The heaviest of them, they get up, fall, and they want to accelerate, and they do not appreciate, and this saying is other than the first; Because he wants to eat usury, they cannot accelerate in walking because of the weight of the stomach, and this is not a madness in anything, and this is confirmed by what is the saying The prophet ﷺ Jabriel called him to the men of each of them, such as the huge house, and one of them is tilt, so his stomach is tilt, so he said, so I said: O Jabr.They eat usury, and they only stand as the one who hides the Satan from touching." And the third saying: It is taken from the words of the Almighty: Those who fear if they touched them as a group of Satan, remember, then if they are in the way of [Al -Arif]:] They call for the request of pleasures, desires, and preoccupation with the other hand, for this is what is meant by touching the Satan, and whoever was like that was in the matter of the world, it is wrong, and the one is disturbed, and the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is wrong, and it is a disturbing And the passion, and the king is running it to religion And piety, there were disturbed movements, and different acts, for this is the mixing with the act of the Satan, and the abundance of usury is not a doubt that it will be in the way Authenticity in it, then if he dies on that love, that love becomes a veil between it and between God Almighty, then the slander that was in the world is in the cause of the love of the money in the money, The humiliation of the hijab, and this interpretation is close to me from the two directions that we have transferred from those who said.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: that is that they said, but the sale is like usury, so it has an questions: the first question: the people were in the solution of usury, and this is the way of this A twenty -year -old, then he sold him in one ten, so this is permissible, so if he sold ten in one of the tenth, he must be permissible; Because there is no difference in the mind between the two things, then this is in the usurch of criticism, and in the god of women, it is also so; Because if he sold the garment, which is twenty in the first place in one of the tenths, then it is permissible, so if he was given the twenty, one of the twenty years is given to a month, and he must be permissible; Because there is no difference in the mind between the two pictures, and that is because there is permissible there; Because he obtained the consensus from the two sides, so we are when the consensus received from the two sides, it must be permissible, too The hand immediately is the hardship of the pilgrim, and it will be in the future from the time of time With the appreciation of the disobedience of usury, then the Lord of Money gives him a greed in the increase, and the debts will return it at the conscience of the money, and give that increase when the money is from the money of the money.The pilgrim before the emotions of money, so this requires the dissolution of usury, as we ruled with the solution of the sake of the sects for the sake of paying the need, for this is the suspicion His saying: God has permitted the sale and forbade usury and the answer is that what you mentioned is an opposition to the text of the measurement, and it is from the work With the measurement, he said: I am better than it created me from a fire and created it from clay [p.: 76] and know that the death of the measurement (P-80) will be held in this letters, so they said: This suspicion is obligatory, as it was a built, we know that religion is by text, not by the measurement.The lock mentioned the mercy of God, upon him the difference between the two chapters, so he said: He who sold a garment of one twenty -ten years old, then he made the same garment On this interview, each one of them became an interview for the other in the money at them, and he did not take anything from his owner, otherwise, but if he sold it, but if he sold it Ten in the tenth, he has taken the twenty -tenth, without compensation, and it is not possible to say: His exposure is the vigor in the period of the sake of time; Because the mourning is not money or something that refers to it until it makes it a mobilization of the adopted, so the difference appeared between the two pictures.The second question: the appearance of his words is up to the Almighty: that is that they said, but the sale is like usury indicates that the return is only to be the one who is the one With the prohibition, and on this estimation, this verse does not prove this verse as the usury of the cabares.If it is said: the presentation of the verse indicates that their resurrection on the Day of Resurrection was disappointed, because they were ate usury.We said: If it says: That is that they said, but the sale is like usury is clear that the cause is for that confusion is this saying and the belief is only, and this is the same The presentation of the verse, and it is clear that it is not the same as the same as the same as the same, and we mentioned it on the signs On the sake of usury and its extremism, and that is because the greatest may express it from the starlets, it is said: So that the money of God is eaten in a vast We carried the most of the strains, the submission of the verse became a custodian for its delay, so this is what indicates it to memorize the verse, except that the prestige of the one who has the good And the feast of the one who shall disgrace the money of usury, there is no feast and the feast of those who decorate this contract.The third question: in the verse a question, which is that why he did not say: but usury is the same as the sale, and that is because the solution of the sale is agreed upon, so they want to be.The measure is that the place of disagreement is likened to the place of agreement, so the verse was said to be said: Ruba is the same as the sale.??The answer is that it was not intended to hold on to the purpose of the measure It is a specialization of one of the two ideals with the solution and the second to the prohibition and on this estimation, which is presented or the last is permissible.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: And God is the greatness of the sale and the deprivation of usury, so he has the books: The first question: It is possible that these words are from the blame of the words of the disbelievers, Ruba, then you say, and God is the best of sale and the deprivation of usury, so how is this reasonable?It means that when they were similar, even if one of them would have come, and the other was forbidden, then this was a rhythm of separation between the two ideals, and that is not the same, so it is not good And God has permitted sale and deprived the Lord, the disbelievers mentioned on the path of the repetition, and more The interpreters have agreed that the words of the infidels were cut off at his saying: The sale is like usury, and as for his saying: And God is the best of God And his text on this difference mentioned it as heroes to say the infidels, but the sale is like usury, and the argument is on the validity of this saying: P-81) This is the words of the infidels, only by adding increases that this is carried on that on the way of denial, or that is carried on the narration from the saying of the one who said The guarantee is the disagreement of the original, but if we made it the words of God, it is not necessary in it to this guarantee, then that was the first.The second pilgrimage: that the Muslims are ever, they were holding in all the issues of selling this verse, and if only they knew that this is the words of God, not the words of God, not the words of God, not the words To infer it, and in this argument, there will be a word that will come in the second question.The third pilgrimage: He is the Almighty mentioned the head of this word, saying: Whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord, then he ended up with what he has gone to and whoever is a matter In it, they are immortal, so they showed these words that it requires that when they are touched by those suspicions, and it is his saying: but the sale is the same as the Lord, so God has come to God.Weakened it, and if it was not his saying: God has permitted the sale and forbade usury as the words of God, there was no answer to that suspicion, and it was not mentioned, so he did not say: His Lord is appropriate to this position.The second question: The Shafi’i is gone, may God be pleased with him, that he said: God has permitted the sale and forbidden the usury of the glories that he does not have to do so, And it indicates his faces: the first: that we have shown us in the origins of jurisprudence that the domesticated name is in the words of the definition, and the general is not the dead, but it is not in it, but it is not in it It was also sufficient to work with him in the evidence of his judgment in one image.And the second face: that if we are delivered that it is beneficial to the general, but we do not doubt that the general statement is weakened by the benefit of the gathering of the whole, for example, the saying He benefited from the darkening, except that his saying, and God is the most powerful in the benefit of the exploitation, and it was proven that his saying: And God is the best of sale, and he does not benefit from the use The estimation of the general person must be brought up with many specializations that are out of confusion and the tip, and the same is the same general, and the words of God are not fulfilled; Because he is a liar and a liar for God is a referred to a referral, but the year that is the subject of specialization from it is very serious, so this is permissible; Because the release of the exploitation of the most famous is a well -known definition in the words of the Arabs, She proven that this was carried by the generally unable.The third face: What was narrated, "On the authority of Omar, may God be pleased with him, he said: We learned that this is the vessel of the possibilities.Every Lord is a forbidden; because the usury is the increase and there is no sacrifice and the intention is to be destroyed, so the first of the verse permitted all the louds.With this verse, it was beautiful, so the return in the permissible and the forbidden to the two messengers ﷺ.* * * * The preacher is that it is not true and because it is in the sense of preaching, and he read my father and the good.The predecessor in which there are two questions: (P-82) The first question: in the interpretation and Jahan: The first: Al-Zajaj said: That is: he forgave him what he went from his sins before him As he said, say to those who disbelieve if they are forbidden, they will be forgiven for what the predecessor has been involved [Al -Anfal: 38] and this is a weakness, because it is before the revelation of the verse.That is a forbidden or a sin, so how is it said that the verse is from the verse of that sins with that there was no sins?He added that to him in the words of the assignment, and it is his saying: He has what he has preceded, so how is this to be a sin.He was a predecessor, but whoever does not spend after him, he will not take him, but he has the head of his money, then he only indicated that he has shown him after that, and he said: Al -Qarah: 279].The face of the high, and the predecessor is presented before the food, and the predecessor of the wine is its class; For those who are interpreters, except that I say it: This verse is specialized in those who have left the usurch The introduction of the verse and its delay.Remissible to the precedent, and the closest to the male in this word is what God narrated that they said: The sale is like usury, so he said: So he ended up To him, the meaning was: so it was forbidden to say this.As for the delay of the verse, he said it, and whoever returns, those who are the people of the fire are in it, they are immortal and its meaning: [Who] returned to the advanced words, and he is the most desirable of the Lord and the command of God It is said: It is as it is forbidden to be broken by usury, as well as the abundance of usury, or not like that, if the first was this person, a receptor of God, with the knowledge of God.So, then he deserves praise, glorification, and dignity, but his saying: And his command to God is not like that, because he is beneficial to him, if he wills, if he wills, and he wills him, and he wills him.That this verse is not met by infidels or the obedient believer, and it was not left until it is a disagreement with those who acknowledged the forbidden of the Lord, then he will be for him, then he will be for him He forgive him, and he is like him that God does not forgive that he will be involved in it and forgive what is without that for those who are blessed [Women: 48], so that this is a manifestation of the meaning From God, it is desirable.As for his saying: Whoever returns, these are the people of the fire, in which they are immortal, the meaning is: whoever returns to seek help to the usury until he becomes an infidel.He knew that his saying: Those who are the people of the fire are in it, in which they are a sophisticated manner that the immortality is only for the disbelief because its saying: Those who are the people of the fire.He returned to the saying of the infidel, and so is his saying: they are in it, they are beneficial to the confinement, and this indicates that his son is the owner of the fire, and his universe in the fire is not in the fire, there is no We are this back and entered the caller of the infidels in it, but he remains on his appearance in the owner of the oldest, so he hopes that these places are, and that is what we are The biggest, if he is believers in God and His Messenger, may be permissible in his right to pardon God from him, and it is permissible for God to punish him, and his command in the two chapters is the one who is entrusted to God.God is not immortalized in the fire, but it is removed from it, and God Almighty is among the validity of this health in these verses with his words and the command of God to the authority of God, to God.The great owner of what he has shown.Then his saying: Those are the people of the fire in which they are immortalized, indicating that God is able to bring him the fire, but he does not create it for it because it is not in it, because it is not in it.In the people of faith, and this is a good manner and a good interpretation.
