The Quranic researcher, as he said, is the Almighty: All you know, then you will know, so they will communicate with what before him and what after him, but the first (p-75) The matter is not as it is anxious that these are the true happiness of the number of numbers and the children, and as for its connection after it, then the meaning of the division is the meaning When the evildoer becomes a repentant, the infidel is a Muslim, and the heat is ascetic, and it is the saying of good: Do not deceive you as many of those you see around you, so you will die, and you will die, and you will die.And its report: the day when the woman escapes [Abs: 34], and we come to us with an individual [Maryam: 80], and you have come to us.Conclusion, and they mentioned in the confusion: one of them: that it is for sure, and that it is a holiday after and a feast as you say to the text: I say to you, then I say to you, then I will say to you.And secondly: that the first is when the death is where it is said to him: No, I will be, and the second is in the question of the grave: Who is your Lord?The third is when the enemy is calling for the call, so it is a naughty naughty, not a happiness, then it is never, and when it is said: and the day is distinguished [Yass: 59] and the third: Dear infidels: Then you will know, you believe, and he read it like that, for the first is a Eid and the second and a promise.And its elevation: that every one knows the ugliness of the darkness, the lie, and the good of the justice and the honesty, but it does not know the destiny of its effects and its arguments, then it is the Almighty: The detailed, but detailing the exterior, so that it was a good increase, the knowledge of knowledge, and also in the side of the aging, so it was divided by the one, so it was divided by the one, so it is the case.It is clogged, then when the resurrection, then at the account, then when the garden and fire entered, then the fold of the chair.Fifth: that one of the two states is the torment of the grave and the other is the torment of resurrection, as it was narrated from Abu Dharr that he said: I was doubting the torment of the grave, until I heard the son of Ali He says: This verse indicates the torment of the grave, but he said: Then, because among the two worlds and the two roles is dead.If you know the knowledge of the juvenile, you would have seen the hell, then they would see it in the eyes of the jacin, in which there are books: the first question: they agreed on the authority of the answer.And that it is not his saying: to see the hell, “if only” and it is indicated by Jahan: one of them: that there was no answer, “if his exile was a sin, and he was a sin, and he was a sin.His saying: The hell would not be answered as “if“ if this is not a vision, and that is invalid, for this is the vision of the sever What is meant by this vision is its vision by the heart in the world, then this vision is not other than and signed.The second: that his saying: Then Let them ask about the day of the good news about an issue that will be cut off, so he will be given to what is not found nor the ugly of the arrogance, and I know that the answer is in this way The best, the man says to the man: If you did this, that is, so, God Almighty said: If those who disbelieve know that they will not be enough for them to be enough for them [Al -Anbiya: 39] And there was no answer for him and said: If you see, they will stand on their Lord [Al -Anaam: 30] If you know this, then say: They mentioned in the answer: “ The fearful: “If you know the knowledge of the lean,“ What are you doing to multiply.And the second: The father of a Muslim said: If you knew, what should you have to hold on it, or if you knew, for any matter you created, you would have seen it.And the third of it: He deleted the answer, so that the illusion is gone, so that it will be more exaggerated, and as if he said: “If you knew what you do not know But you are a

every position, without what the other position was punished, as if he said: Do not do this, then you will do this, then you will do this, then you will do so As you do not do this, for you are more harmful to him This position in the sense of “really” as if it was really said: if you know the knowledge of the lean.The third question: in its saying: the knowledge of the jacin and the Jahan: one of them: that it is meaningful knowledge, so I will be added to the eloquence, as the one said: 109] It is said: the mosque of the college and the first year.The second: that the two people are the death, the resurrection, and the resurrection, and the death was called in his saying: and worship your Lord until the sins come to you [the stone: 99] The doubt is removed, for the meaning, if you know the knowledge of the death and what the human being is with him and after him in the grave and in the hereafter, the multiplication and the abundance of God did not distract you from the remembrance of God I know such knowledge, that is: I achieve it, and so, the knowledge of the doctor knows the knowledge and the knowledge of the account, because the sciences are types, so it is good for that to be said: I know that.* * * The following question: The knowledge is one of the most trusted actions, so if the time of work is in front of it, it was a promise of a promise It was mentioned that the two centuries when he entered the dark With him, they took from that costume, and when they came out of darkness and found them, then they took them in the grief, that is, when they did not take more than what they took, and those who took it, and those who took it, and those who took it, and those who took it Also in grief, so this will be the conditions of the people of resurrection.The fifth question: In the verse, a great threw for the scholars, so it indicated that if the lean gave in the proliferation and the frustration of the ritual, the rituals of the ritual This requires that whoever does not leave the multiplication and fools does not be the one who has a scourge for him, the loyalty of the scientist who is not a worker, then the state for him.The sixth

the distant: if they see them from a distant place, they heard it, and it is cloudy [Al -Furqan: 12] and his saying: And the hell is protected from those who see the one who sees: [36] They became an encryption of fire.And the third of it: that the first vision of the roses and the second when it enters it, and it was said: This interpretation is not good because he said: Then he asked the question Entry.And its sequence: the first and secondary vision.Fifth: That the intended to see the hell is otherwise once, so the remembrance of the vision will be two times a expressive of the vision and its connection to the one who is in the way As if they were said to them on the one hand: if you were today, they are complaining about it, and they will not believe in it, so you will see it as a continuous vision of it, and it is a long time.As his saying: What you see in the creation of the Most Merciful from the difference - to its saying - return the eyesight two times [King: 3, 4] in the sense that you did not look at what you did not have to do so He returns two times only, so we are here, if it is said: What is the benefit of the second vision of the second vision?We said: Because they were at the first time they saw a flame, not other than, and in the second time they saw the soul of the fossil and how the stroke is in it and the vitality of the tallness, and the tone

it, and it will come to it, and it will come to it.Ibn Amir and Al -Kisa’i, as if they wanted to see her, so they saw her, and for that he read the second: (Then to see it) with the conquest, and in this second, then the second is the second.They saw it, and in the reading General; The second is a confirmation of affirmation and the drivers of the benefits that we have prepared, and he knew that the readers ’readings are first for the two ways: The first: The Farah said: Destroy, so it does not know that hell is his memorization.The second: Abu Ali said: The meaning in: to see the hell to see the torment of hell, do you not see that the hell sees the believers, too Likewise, the one was in the vision of its torment, not in the vision of itself, indicating this saying: as they see the torment [Al -Baqarah: 165] and his saying: And if he sees: 85] This indicates that they are more likely to see those who have come.
