The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: they see it far away and we see it as close.The guilt is in what he will come to what he returns?In it, Jahan: The first: He is a leading to the coming torment.And the second: It is domesticated to: a day that was five years old, that is, they will return it on the authority of the referral, and we see it as a closeness in (p-111) To us and not excuse.What is meant by the long time is from the place, and the close relative of it.His Excellency said: The day the sky is like the elderly and the mountains are like a curse and does not ask Hamim with a Hamim in which there are two questions: the first question: “The day of what is?In it, it is one of them: one of them: a relative, and the estimation: we see it as a relative, the day the sky is like the elderly, that is, it can and it is not excused in that day.And the second: the estimation: he asked a question with a suffering torment, the day the sky is like a lease.And the third: the ability on the day the sky is like the elderly and such and such.And the four: to be an instead of a “day” and the estimation he asked a question with a sufficient torment that occurred on a day that was five years old, a thousand years, as a day.The second question: that the day is mentioned for that day: the first adjective: that the sky is in it as the elderly and we remember the interpretation Ibn Abbas said: Kaddari al -Zayat, and a bid narrated from him: like the heart of the country, and Al -Hassan said: Like the silver if it is dissolved, and it is the saying of Ibn Masoud.The second line: that the mountains are in it like a curse, and the meaning of the cursed in the language: the captive wool is colors, but the likeness of it is; Because the mountains are new, white, red, and black.If it is smuggled and raised in the atmosphere, it is similar to the cursed, if the wind folds it.The third adjective: His saying: He does not ask Hamim and has two questions: The first question: Ibn Abbas said: The generous is the closeness that disobeyed him, and the question is not for him One of itself, and it is like his saying: every breastfeeding woman is groaning from what I have ranked [Hajj: 2] and his saying: The day of the woman escapes from his brother to the saying of each of them.A thing that he sings [Abbas: 37] Then in the verse, it is one: one of them: that the estimation is: He does not ask Hamim about his protector, then the neighbor is deleted and the verb is connected.The second: He does not ask Hammam, how is your condition and does not speak to him; Because every one who occupies it from this speech.The third: He does not ask Hamim with a rushing, and he does not ask Hamim, a good ghee for him and no companion.The second question: Ibn Katheer reads: His friend, and this is also on the authority of the neighbor.Al -Farah said: That is, it is not said to Hamim: Where are you?I love this reading; Because it is contrary to what the readers have.
