The Quranic researcher, and his saying is the Almighty: He taught the human being what he did not know, so it is required that what is meant is that he taught him the pen and taught him, too.Like this in the words, you say: I am honored, I have improved to you, the money of the money, the mandate, and it is necessary for you to be intended from the one who is the one.With the pen he did not know, so he would be his saying: He knew the human being, and he did not know what to say: He knew the pen.He said: “No, the human being will be overwhelmed by the issues: the first question: the most interpreter is that the person who is intended for a person is one of them is one of them, and he is the father of Jahl, and then he said: From here to the last of her in my ignorant father.It was said: I descended from his saying: I saw the one who ends a servant [Al -Alaq: 9] to the last surah in Abi Jahl.Ibn Abbas said: “The Prophet ﷺ was praying, and Abu Jahl came, so he said: Did he not tighten you from this?Al -Wadi is a club, so God Almighty revealed: Let his club let him call the Zaban.It is created from a relationship, so it does not suffer from the arrogance, for it is that it is more empty and reinforced by its hope and its trance in Mecca.It is narrated that he said: It is not in the Mecca of the generosity of me.Perhaps God cursed him, he said that in response to his saying: And your Lord is the honor, then those who say this saying from them are those who claimed that this is not from what is from what is from.And among them who said: It is possible that five verses are from the beginning The first surah, because the verses of the verses were referring to the command of God Almighty, not to see that his saying is up to the Almighty: and fear a day that you will return to God [Al -Baqarah: 281] The interpreters, then it is guaranteed to what he descended before it with a long time.The second saying: that what is meant by a person who is mentioned in this verse is the sentence of man, and the first saying, even if it appears on the basis of the narrations, except that this is the one who is true Because he is the Almighty, showing that God has given Him with his relationship with him, (P-19) and blessed him with the blessings that we have mentioned, and he was in the rituals of it, and he was more and more The limit is perpetuated in the tougies and followed the passion of the soul, and that is a feast and a mine from this way, and then it is the highest that this is the dirt with the saying of your Lord: So, the accounting was located on what was from work and disagreement according to that.The second question: his saying: (all) has faces: one of them: that he is a deterrent and a mittle for those who disbelieve in a blessing God is his tyrants, and if he is not mentioned to the words of the speech on him.And the second: A fighter said: Not that a person does not know that God is the one who created him from the relationship and taught him after the ignorance, and that is because he is the one who has gone, The hearts of the heart in the love of the world do not think about these conditions and do not contemplate it.And the third of it: Al -Jarjani mentioned the owner of the systems that (all) is in the sense of really because it is not before it, nor is it something that it is (all of it), and it is for it, and it is for it.[The Detaire: 32] They claimed that it is in the sense: any and the moon.The third question: the tyrant is the arrogance and the frequency, and the fulfillment of the words in this verse is that God Almighty is what was mentioned in the presenter of the surah, the evidence of the appearance of the And the ruling on where he is far from the sane person, not to be informed of it and does not stand on its facts.Follow it with what is the original reason for the negligence of it, which is the love of the world and the preoccupation with money, prestige, arrival and capacity, for it is not because of the blindness of the heart in the truth.If it was said: Pharaoh claimed the rabbit, so God Almighty said in his right: He went to Pharaoh, he was overwhelmed [Taha: 24] and he mentioned in my father: With this pain, what is the reason for this leadership?We said: There are faces in it: one of them: that he said to Moses: He went to Pharaoh, that he was overwhelmed and that before he met Moses and before he was presented to him, and he was given to him.Rabbiyah.As for here, he is the Almighty mentioned this verse as a question for his Messenger when he responded to him the ugliness of the response.And the second: that Pharaoh with the options of his authority would not have increased his disbelief on the saying, and he would not have been subjected to the killing of Moses, peace be upon him.As for the father of Jahl, he is with a little ignorance, he was intending the killing of the Prophet ﷺ and his abuse.And the third of it: that Pharaoh was good to Moses first, and he said last: I believed [Yunus: 90].As for the father of Jahl, the Prophet envied in his young, and he said at the end of his throw: they reached Muhammad on me that I die and no one who hates me from him.And its booster: that if they were two messengers, but the beloved is in the metaphor of the Kalim as a country in the correspondence of the eye, and the sane person will see his eyes on the authority of what they see him, but he will be, but he will be, but he will be, but he will give him to the hand of his hand The cause was more than the way.
