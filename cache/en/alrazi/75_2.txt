The Quranic researcher (P-189) (Surah of Resurrection) Four Mentioned Mechanism ﷽ I do not divide on the Day of Resurrection, nor do I swear by the soul of the mother.I swear by the soul in the verse: the first question: the interpreters are mentioned in the word “no” in its saying: I do not divide three three things: the first: Increased, and the meaning is divided into the Day of Resurrection, and its counterpart, so that the people of the book do not know [Al -Hadid: 29] and his saying: What prevents you is that you do not prostrate, so what is the mercy of God: 159] This saying has a weak from the faces: the first: that this is the permissibility of this, which leads to stab In denial, and its permanence leads until the accommodation remains to prove it or its negation.And the second: that this letter is increased in the righteousness of the words, not in its first, because it was said: the words are upon him from two faces: the first: we do not surrender that it is increased in the righteousness of the words.He increased it in the consumption of his poem, and it is his saying: No, and the father of the daughter of Al -Amiri does not claim the people that I am the second: Like one wall to contact each other, and the evidence is that he may remember something in a wall, and then his answer comes in a surah, and he said: We are reminded of the remembrance that you are crazy [Al -Hijar: 6] Then his answer came in another wall while he said: What you are with the grace of your Lord with a sin: This surah is running and running the words.The answer is about the first: that his saying “No and your father” is a division of the negation, and his saying: I do not divide a negation of the division, so you will be seen by one of them.His saying I do not divide a negation of the division, because it is over our saying: I do not kill, do not go away, not support, and know that this is beneficial to the negation.The evidence is upon him that if a solution was not divided, the righteousness was by launching the division, and the jet by doing the division, so it appeared that the house (P-190) is the one who is the one.And on the authority of the second: The Qur’an is like one wall in the numbers of the contradiction, either to be associated with every verse that was established with the last verse, so this is not permissible.With all the proof of the navigator in the birds of the verses, and that requires the conversion of every denial of negation and the conversion of every denial of evidence, and it is not permissible.And the third of it: that what is meant is from our saying: “No” is that “a false linguist, whose widening and risk must be made until the words are continued, and the knowledge of the words of God does not.The second saying of the two interpreters in this verse: what was said about the good is that he read “to divide” that the blame is for the sake, and I divide the news of It is: I am divided, and I support it It is in the journalist of Uthaman with a thousand thousand, and they agreed in his saying: I do not divide with the soul of the mother, on “I do not divide”.The resurrection is to honor it, and I do not swear by the soul of the imam for its statues, and the father of Ubaidah was stabbed in this reading, and he said: If the intention was for this, he said: She says: I do not do so, but they say: Do not do so, except that the one told the one who told that of that on his authority and the virginity, and I know that this face is also weak; Because this reader is anomalous, it is that this anomalous is a contingent, so what is the face in the well -known readings?It is not possible to pay it, otherwise it would be a praise, as it was proven with frequency, and also, so it is necessary to add another section to be this mother, as a answer for it And God is divided into the Day of Resurrection, so this is a division on a division, and it is a pillar and because it leads to seizures.The third saying: that the word “no” was returned to the negation, then we are the first: the first: that it returned a denial of the words that were mentioned before the oath, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were the division, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were the division, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were the division, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were the division, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were, as if they were the division, as if they were the division, as if they were the division, as if they were, The matter is not about what you mentioned, then it was said: I swear on the Day of Resurrection, and this is also in it forms, because the return of the negation time is once again in the saying The blame is with the fact that what is mentioned is what they mentioned in the words of the speech.The second indifference: that “there is no” for the exile of the division as if he said: I do not divide you with that day If you separate the death, if you calculate that, then know that you are able to do so.This saying is the choice of my father, a Muslim, which is the most correct, and this saying can be able to say that one of them is: as if he said: I do not divide this.The one who is required is that this is the greatest and more than that it is divided by these things, and the supply of this words is the greatest of the division of it.And the second: as if it is the highest saying: I do not swear by these things by proving this aspiration, because its proof is more and more loud, stronger, and I see that it is began to be done.He said after him: What is the human being, will we not collect his bones, that is: how he had a rhetoric of this corrupt kidney with the appearance of his corruption.And the third of it: that the abuse of it will be the way to the path of denial, and the appreciation: that I do not divide the Day of Resurrection.Not to swear by the nomadic soul that the precedence and the publication are true.The second question: Remember the soul of the lameh, and one of them: Ibn Abbas said: Every soul is that it is blamed for its soul, the day of the resurrection, whether it is a ritual, or it is just.As for the righteousness, it is for the sake of it that it did not increase its obedience.With piety, and some of them were stabbed in this direction from his faces: the first: that whoever deserves the reward is not permissible to blame his soul on the leaving of the leadership, because it is for it, because it is for it, because it is for it, because it is from it On that, he will be done otherwise to blame it.The second: that the human being blames his soul at the tone and narrowed the heart, and that is not met with the people of paradise if they are in the paradise, and that there is no one who knows that Obedience except for what is more than it is more than that, and if that was obligatory for the day, he would not be referred Crime.The answer to all: that the day (P-191) is carried on the wish of the leadership, and then this question will fall.And the second: that the righteous soul is the veiled souls that blame the disobedient breath on the day of the resurrection by the reason that it left piety.Third: It is the mourning souls that are still blamed for itself, even if it strives in the obedience, and from the good that the believer does not see it except for the soul of his soul What is in it is eclipse.And he pushed it: It is the same as Adam, and she did not blame her action, which she came out of paradise.Fifth: What is meant is the souls of the hardships, when the conditions of the resurrection and its parents have seen, so it is blamed for itself on what he issued from the ticks, and its counterparts said: The same as my escape on what I was involved [Al -Zamer: 56].And its sixth: that the human being is a man who was created.The blame, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: The human being is created if the evil touches it as a reward, and if the good touches it as a variety [Al -Maraj: 19] and he knows that he said: Recruitment and return, as well as saying in a blame, torment and dies.The third question: I know that in the verse there are problems: one of them: what is the caused between the resurrection and between the soul of the mother, until God gathered between them in the division?And the second: The division is the arrival of the resurrection, and he will hold it that it is the highest division of the fall of the resurrection.And the third of it: Why did he say: I do not divide the Day of Resurrection and did not say: and resurrection, as he said in the path of the light: The answer to the first of its faces: one of it: that the conditions of the resurrection are very strange, then the intended of the resurrection of the ritualization of the lubrication of the lubrication.It means its happiness and its misery, so it was done between the resurrection and the slave of the lame of this adherence.And the second: that the division of the soul is a warning on the wonders of the soul on what he said, peace and blessings be upon him: The wondrous saying is the Almighty: I did not create Jinn and humanity except to worship [Dhiyatiyat: 56] and his saying: We have provided safety to his saying: The human being carried it [Al -Ahbab: 72] and he said: The division is the division.The meaning of glorification is where it is ever, the verb of its action, its grandfather, and its existence in the obedience of God, and others said: It is the highest division of the resurrection, and it is not divided.This is on the abnormal readings that we have narrated from goodness, as if he was upset, he said: The soul is either that it is an infidel with the resurrection with the greatness of its matter, or that it is a pasture that is limited to the work, and on the two estimates, then it will be.As for the second question: the answer to it is what we mentioned that the investigators said: The division of these things is a division of its Lord and its creator in the truth, as if it is said: And the fall of the day of resurrection.As for the third question: his answer is that he was divided, he said: The plane and the warnings, but here, he denied that it is the highest, divided by these things, so the question is.
