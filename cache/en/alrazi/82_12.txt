pursuit of it, he said: You are lying on the Day of Religion while he is the Day of Account and Permanent, and the angels of God are the one who will be blessed with you.The day of resurrection, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: on the authority of the Yemeni and the north, the one who is said of what is said of the saying of it, except for it, a righteous, a murdered one, [Q: 18, 17].His worshipers and send you a memorization [Al -Anam: 61] Then there are permissible: the first: from people who stab They are compounds from the pleasant bodies such as the air, the lane, and

in the air, and if the second is, we must see them when it is permissible to be present and do not see them, so it will be done to be in the presence And times, we do not see it and do not hear it, and that is an entry into ignorance, as well as the saying in the denial of their deeds and their desires and their kiss.And secondly: that this is the subscription, if it is free from the benefits,

to be a testimony on people and an argument for them on the day of the resurrection, except that this is a weak The human being who knows that God is exalted and does not oppress and does not oppress, does not need in his right to prove this Hajj, and who does not know that, he does not interact with this He commanded them to write these things against him.And the third of it: that the actions of the hearts are not visible and no trauma, so they will be from the chapter of the absences, and the absence does not know it except God Almighty on what he said: and he is not.It is [Al -Anam: 59] and if these actions are not known to the angels, it is impossible to write it and the verse requires that they be the writers of all of us.That is from the actions of the hearts or not?The answer to the first: that this suspicion is still only on our basis, based on two in the first place.One of them: that the structure is not a condition for life with us.The second: that is, when the sense of the sense, the presence of the visual, and the obtaining of the brigades of the boundaries, it is not obligatory to realize, so the first original is permissible for the angels to be a fine And separate

are (P-77) as a dignity.And the third of it: they are two writers.And its booster: they know what you do, and in it.One of them: They know that actions so that they can write it, and this alerts him that the human being does not have martyrdom except after the knowledge.The second: They write it until they are scientists with the performance of the testimony.He knew that God has described them with this fifth characteristics that indicate that he is the highest of them and the greatness of them and the greatness The people of the affairs, and if not for that, he would not have been attached
