The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: except for a rhetoric from God and his messages, they mentioned in this dedication and faces: one of them: that he is a dedication of his saying: (I have no money) In a report from God, and his saying: Say: I will not tell me a senior sentence that was located in the between to confirm the denial of the obedience to it, and it is the one who is a reward for it.It is bad that no one is able to make it from it, and this is the saying of the freedom.And the second: It is the saying of the gospel: that it is based on the substance from its saying: (fully) and the meaning: I will not find from it without a refuge except a rhetoric, that is, it is not possible for me to come to me I was sent by it, and I say this is a disconnection; Because he was upset when he did not say: I will not find a fullest, but he said: I will not find from it without it, (P-146), and the rhetoric from God is not within the time of the one who said: Because the rhetoric from God is not from God, but it will be from God and with His help and success.Third: Some of them said: (Except) it is meaning, and it is meaning: I do not inform a report as your saying: (Except) for a resurrection, and the meaning: if I am not informed, then I will not, then I will not, then I will not, then I will not, then I will not be informed, then I will not find it.Al -Mashaour is that it is said: He was informed of him, peace be upon him: “They reached me, they reached me,” so he said: “In a report from God?” We said whoever is not in a description to reach it, but it is in a house from his saying: a light from God [the repentance: 1] in the sense of a report from God.As for his saying: (His messengers), he is a kindness on a rhetoric, as if he said: I have no money for you except to be tilted and messengers, and the meaning is that I am not informed of God, so he said: He said to him, and to inform his messages, whom we send me uniform and no shortcomings.His Excellency said: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, then he has the fire of hell.His saying: Whoever returns, then God will take revenge on him and whoever disbelieves, then he enjoys him, so whoever believes in his Lord, then he does not fear that the beginning in it is a guarantee and said: Hell on the estimation of his reward, that he has the fire of hell, as your saying: For God has a fifth of God [Anfal: 41], meaning his judgment is that he has a fifth.* * * Then the Almighty said: I never be pregnant with the meaning of the gathering in whom and in the verse are two questions: the first question: the darkening of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one in the verse.Prayers are immortalized in the fire, and that this general includes them as the disbelievers, they said: This is the return of conditions on the condition that there is no ritual, and no obedience The public is stronger in the significance of this one who is required from the brochure of the worlds; Because the righteous of the generals came in it: (ever), the violator carries the immortality on the one Tawil, but here [he lost] came to the forefront of that, then that is openly in the overthrow of the involvement that the violator mentioned (and the answer) that we have shown us in the surah of the cow.Holding with this general, and we are increasing our faces: one of them: to specialize the general person with the arrest that is for the sake of which, and that is the general of the one who is a well -known.To come out of the house for an hour, and the husband said: If you go out, then you are a divorce that benefits that right with that time, until it is, even if it is for the time of the day.So, the hadith was done in the Tablig from God Almighty, then he said: Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger means Gabriel: because he has the fire of hell, which is the one who disobeys it Live, then he has the fire of hell, and if what we mentioned is an inner, he will fall the face of the recipient.The second direction: This is the return that must be taken into account.Because it is the ugly to remember the head of this existence, a judgment that is not related to it, so this is the return and a feast on the leaving of the rituals, and there is no way God is the greatest of sins, and the raised the greatest of sins, it is not permissible to be a arrangement for all sins; Because the voracious sins in the younger and old are not permissible to be equal in the aging, and if it is proven that this is the punishment on this sins, and it was not the same This sin is not permissible to be a wise man on the path of sins.The third direction: It is that it is the highest of the domains of the good in the brochures of the verses of the Qur’an, and it is not restricted by the rest of the forever, and he mentioned it to us with the rest of this It is only that this sins are the greatest of sins, and if the cause is in this specialization this meaning, we know that this bid is devoted to this sin, and otherwise It was proven that this return is concluded with this (P-147) sin, the verse became indicative of the fact that the condition of the guys of the guys with the difference of that; Because he said: He has the fire of hell, ever in it, which is based on that this is the case for him, not for others, and this is like his saying: for your religion: And if it is proven that they have this situation, not for others, and it is obligatory in the jungle of the guys that they would not have the fire of hell on the path of perpetuation, so it appeared that this is the same.To them.And on their contact with the verse is another question, which is that his saying: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, but whoever disobeys God and His Messenger is all, and all the types of sins are We say that the infidel remains in the fire.عَصى اللَّهَ بِجَمِيعِ أنْواعِ المَعاصِي; Because his saying: Whoever disobeys God will be valid for all kinds of sins for him, for example, he is said: Whoever disobeys God except in disbelief or in adultery, or in adultery, or in adultery, or in adultery, or in adultery, or in adultery, or in adultery, or in adultery.Those who say that the ruling of the discretion is the one who was if it was inside, within the time Snap, which is like that is the infidel, for the verse is specialized in the infidel on this estimation, so the face of the recipient has fallen.If it was said: the one of the single human being is for all kinds of ticks referred; Because it is referred to be an embodiment, and that it will be with that, saying by disturbing, and if that is a referred, then the verse is carried out on it, so it is not permissible, and it is not permissible.The mind is permissible, and he said: Whoever disobeys God, he will benefit from him with all kinds of sins, he left work with him in the destiny who prevented the mind of his mind لِلْآتِي بِجَمِيعِ الأشْياءِ الَّتِي يُمْكِنُ الجَمْعُ بَيْنَها.It is known that the group is among the disbelief and others is possible, so the verse will be specialized in it.The second question: the one who said that the matter is to be answered by this verse, so they said: The one who is commanded by him is a disobedience to his saying: God is what he commanded [the prohibition: 6], and I do not disobey you with an order [Al -Kahf: 69] and the disobedience is due to the punishment for his saying: Whoever disobeys God and his Messenger, then he has a fire.
