The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: The people who believed and those who have guided, the Christians and the Sabeans who believe in God and the last day and do good, so they have their reward for them, and they have no reward for them They are sad, know that the famous reader: they were guided by the significance of the sign, and the laughter, and a jurisprudence with the conquest of the signifier, the place of waw, and the readers of the sabid, the sacrifices, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins, the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins and the two sins, Where they were, and for a sophisticated, Shabba, Al -Zahri, and the young men, with a dwelling place, without a prodigy, and the soaps are with a guaranteed pattern and the deletion of the prestige, and on the authority of Al -Omari, and on the authority of Al -Omar.With two good things, they are the same as the hammer.And the other: the heart of the hazardine, so we say: the young men, the young, and the choice is the prodigy because it is the most frequent reader and to the sense of interpretation, because the people of knowledge said: He knew that the habit of God, if he mentioned (P-97), is a promise or a feast, he was punished by what he is contrary to, so that the words are completely Tell what the believers of the great reward and the honorable reward indicate that he is their pursuit and the exalted be rewarded with the good with his charity and the one who has been in the way of his loyalty to what he said: Do and reward those who are good with goodness [Al -Nujam: 31] So he said: Those who believed and dispersed the beneficiaries in what is meant by him, and because this is the one who says that he said: The verse: Whoever believes in God and the last day, then this requires that what is meant by faith is in his saying, the Almighty: Those who believe in the one who does not say: By God and his counterpart in forms, His Excellency is the Almighty: O you who believe, believe [Women: 136].What is meant by those who believe before the resurrection of Muhammad, Jesus, who are peace with the brightness of the falsehood of the Jews and the Christians, like Qais ibn Sa`dah, and al -Raheb, And Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nafil and Nuqa ibn Nawfal and Salman al -Farisi and Abu al -Dhir al -Ghaffari and the redeeming of the Najashi, as if he said: “The one who is the one who believes Muhammad and those who were on the false religion that is for the Jews and those who were on the false religion that the Christians have everyone who believed in after the sake The last and with Muhammad, so they have their reward for their Lord.And the second: It is the highest mentioned in the first of this surah, the way of the hypocrites and then the way of the Jews, so what is meant by the saying of the Almighty is: those who believe are those who believe.Without the heart, they are the hypocrites, so the hypocrites remembered, then the Jews, the Christians and the Sabeans, as if it is the Almighty He said: These are the ones who are invalidated by all those who came from them with the true faith.And the third of it: What is meant by his saying: Those who believe in the believers in Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, are in the truth while he is to the past, and then he said: The future, so what is meant by those who believed in the past and fixed on that and dictated to him in the future, and he is the saying of the speakers.As for the saying of the Almighty: Those who have guided them, they have disappeared in his detection on his face We have returned and returned, and it is on the authority of Ibn Abbas.And the second: they were called it because they were attracted to the greatest of the oldest of Jacob, but the Arabs said with the sign of the Arabization, for the Arabs, if they are transmitted from the names of the lame, to the lame of the Some of its forefathers.And the third of it: Abu Amr ibn al -Alaa said: They were called that because they are proud of any that they moved with the readers of the supplication The village that Jesus, peace be upon him, was called to call Nazareth, and they attributed to her, and he was the saying of Ibn Abbas and Qatada and Ibn Jarraj.And the second: to support them in between them, that is, to support each other.And the third of it: Because Jesus, peace be upon him, said to the dialogue from my supporters to God, the owner of the scouts said: The Christians are the collection of Nasran, a man is said to be Nazran, and a woman in Nasran For the sake of the lame, which is in red, because they are Christ.As for the saying of the Exalted: The Sabeans are from the morning if it comes out from his religion to another debt, and the Arabs (P-98) were called the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he is the peace of peace.Their adherence and the stars of the stars if they are brought out of their lords.And we brought us with it if we come out with it, and for the interpreters in the interpretation of their gold, sayings: one of them: Mujahid and Al -Hassan said: They are a sect of the mangain, and there is no time Their misfortune.And the second: Qatada said: They are people who worship the angels and pray to the sun every fifth day of prayers.And he also said: The enemies are five of them for the two of the two and the most merciful: the Sabeans who worship the angels, and the craftsman, and they worship the fire, and those who worship the fire The second, the Jews and the Christians.And the third of it: It is the closest that they are people who worship the cries, and then they say: The first: that the uncle of the world is God, the Glory of God, except that he is the one who is a matter A kiss for prayer, supplication and glorification.And the second: that God is the creation of the fruits and the makers, then the makers are the monitor of what is in this world of good, evil, health, and the illness, and the creator of it, for the good Ghone of it because it is the god The monitoring of this world, then it is worshiping God, Glory be to Him.For their saying, then they will be shown in this four team Their misguidance and believe in the right debt, for God is His grace and the Almighty accepts their faith and obedience to them and does not return them from his presence at the time of the faith I mean faith in its messengers and entered into faith on the other day, all the rulings of the hereafter, for these two sayings have all gathered all that is connected to the religions in the case of the one in the case of the one and in the case of the reward.As for his words of exalted: when their Lord is not the intention of the place, then this is referred to the right of God Almighty, nor the preservation is like the guns, but rather The course of their Lord.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: There is no fear for them, nor are they grieved, and he said: He wanted the demise of fear and sorrow for them in the world, and among them who said in the hereafter, in the case of the reward, and this is in the case of There is no general fear for them in the negation, as well as: nor are they grieved and this is the adjective that does not get in the world and is special in the costs because they are in every time, and they are not in every time.Either in the causes of the world, or in the matters of the hereafter, as if it was his pursuit and their promise in the last with the reward, then it is clear that it is from that reward to be free from the one who is free from To always be their nakedness, because they were distinguished, as it was cut off for the great grief.If he said: God Almighty mentioned this verse in Surah Al -Maaidah, so: Those who believe and those who have guided and the Sabeans and the Christians who believed So there is no fear for them, nor are they grieving [Al -Maaidah: 69] and in Surah Al -Hajj: Those who believe and those who have guided, the Sabeans, the Christians, the Magora, and those who are among them are the one The day of resurrection is that God is a martyr [Hajj: 17] So, in the disagreement of these verses with the presentation of the kindness and its last and the lifting of the “good” A benefit that requires that?.And the answer: When the speaking was the rulings of the rules, then this change must be of wisdom and the wanders, for if we realize that rule, then we have won, and we have lost us.The shortcomings are on our minds, not the words of the wise, and God knows.
