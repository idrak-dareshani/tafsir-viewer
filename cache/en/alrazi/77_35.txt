The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: This is a day that they do not Then, know that this is the sixth type of types of disbelievers and tightening the matter to them; And that is because he is exalted, indicating that there is no excuse or an argument, as they came to him from the doves, and there is no ability to pay the torment of the soul, so that it is in them The shrine is a kind of torment: one of them: the torment of the lighter, for it is clear on the heads of martyrdom, and it appears to all its shortcomings and shortening it, and everyone who has a mind The torment of the luster is more severe than the killing of the sword and the burning of the fire.And the second: the righteousness of the righteous servant at the door of the mour and his fall in his hand with his knowledge that he is the sincere who is a liar who is lying to him, on what he said.And the third of it: that he sees in that standing, the characteristic of those who were hidden by them and their compatibility with the reward and the greatness, and he sees it, and it is seen, These are three types of spiritual torment.And its elevation: the generous torment, which is the view of the fire and its people, we seek refuge in God from it, so when it gathered in his right, this face is from the torment, but rather what is not what is not.Jarm said: The Almighty said in their right: The night is a day for the lies, and in the verse two questions: The first: How can the collection be among him: You are the Day of Resurrection with your Lord, you will be seen [Al -Zumar: 31] and his saying: And God, our Lord, what we were shared [Al -Anam: 23], and his saying: And they do not have the hadith of God: Ibn al -Azraq asked Ibn Abbas about this question, (and the answer) about it from his face To them, you will be excited; Because it is not for them as they did it as a correct excuse and an upright answer, so if they did not speak with a peaceful argument and a straight word, then they did not do it; Because whoever is delegated by what is not beneficial, as if he did not speak, and his counterpart is what is said to those who mentioned words other than beneficial: you did not say anything.And the second: Al -Farah said: He wanted to say it: a day they do not trust that hour and that destiny from the time that they do not have in it, as he says: The hour is presented, and the one who is intended for all of it; Because the resurrection is in an hour, and it does not extend throughout the day.And the third of it: that its saying: they do not speak for a divorced memorial, and the divorced person does not benefit the general, neither in the types nor in the halls, with the evidence that you say: So and not, and it does not It is good, and a time says: So, so that it does not speak to something of a girl, and this indicates that a concept is "not spared" A blessing is between that it does not speak to some things, and between that he does not speak to all the things, and so you say: So and so does not speak in this time, and does not say: The mother, and this indicates that the concept is “does not trust” is a blessing between the sustainable and the one, and if it is like that, they do not “do not spoil it” With some things and in some of the hamats, and that is not incompatible with the crops of the region with something else in another time, so it is sufficient in the honesty of its saying: they do not come to them (P-27).And a cause in the time of the question, and this is a reference to the validity of the first two answers, according to the mind, if it was said: if a solution is not in this day A part of the parts of the day.We said: I built the days on the kraf, and whom we mentioned about the concept of Al -Falaz from where he is.And the one who was able to do it: that this verse returned and returned the saying of the treasury of hell to them: they went to the shadow of three peoples, and they will be led, and they will be gone In the world with obstacles, then what they were avoided, but in this hour [they have] they became critical in the same way as this cost that is more difficult than everything; Alert it to them, if they left the characteristics in the world, they would not need this time to this arduous purpose.The one who says that his saying: This is a day that does not restrict this time in this work, and the repetition of the divorced person is based on the reason for the words of the words, if the word is in the way of the one who is a good She said: This hour is brought out of the house, so the husband said: If you come out, you are divorced, then he restricts this divorced with that way, so.The second question: Its saying: It is not permissible for them, so they will be delusional that they have an excuse, and they have been forbidden from his remembrance, and this is not met by the wise, (and the answer is: An excuse, but perhaps they imagined the imagination of a medier that they have an excuse for it, so they do not give permission for them in the remembrance of that corrupt excuse, and perhaps that is the virgin With your judgment, your knowledge, your will, and your creation, why are you not tortured by me, for this is a pardoned excuse; If no one is forbidden to leave in the king of how he wanted and wanted, then it was said: Is it not that he said: a messenger is a missionary and a sigh of people, for the sake A pilgrimage after the messenger [Women: 165], and he said: If I had greeted them with a torment before him, they said, “Our Lord, if not you sent a messenger to us [Taha: 134] His heart was that he has an excuse, so he went to his excuse in the standing of the resurrection, a ponding, so why he would not give permission for him in his remembrance until he remembers him, then shows him?We said: When excuses and warning in the world came with the evidence of his saying: the metabolism is a male or a vow, which I was returned to be useful.The third question: Why did he not say: They are not authorized to do so, and they will be excused?As he said: They are not spent on them, and they will die.Well, and he will be doubled for him [Al -Baqarah: 245] by raising and sharing, but they were raised, "they are excited" with kindness; Because if we were erected, that was delusional that they would not be excited; Because they did not give permission to apologize, and that is delusional that they have an excuse for his remembrance, and it is not permissible, but when they were raised, the meaning was that they did not They did not excuse, not for the sake of the ears, but for the sake of the virginity in itself.Then it is an extensive one in it, and it is the argument in the heads of the verses; Because the verses are wow and noun, and if it was said: So they would not be excited, the verses are not wrap He said, and he said in another position: We tormented it with a torment, [Divorce: 8] and the readers were gathered on the first condescension and reduced the second; Let each of them agree.
