The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: The oppression of your Lord is hardening, he is starting and returning, and he is the Forgiving Waddam with the glorious throne, and it is an act of what he wants to know that he knows Those who destroyed the believers and the believers first and mentioned and the promise of those who believed and did the righteous seconds secondly, I want that, and the return is for the one who said: The oppression of your Lord is hardening, and the oppression is the taking of excess, so if it is described with the severity, then it has been multiplied, and it is lost, and its counterpart, if it takes it, is a domain of this: It will be his greeting for the sake of the insult, but for the sake of the wise of the wise of the ruling of the will or the ruling of the salt, and the last thing is that it is the matter of this matter, so it is the matter of this matter, so it is the day of the day, so it is the matter of the day.He begins and restores, that is, he creates his creation and then thinks of them and then restore them with life to be rewarded for the resurrection, so that is the reason for this reason, not for the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the The people of Hell will eat the fire until they become foolish and then restore them a new creation, so that is what is meant by his saying: He begins and returns.Then he said to the confirmation of the promise: He is the Forgiving Waddoufs, so he reminded of the characteristics of his majesty and his oldest five.The first: The Forgiving said the disgraced: He is the Forgiving to those who repent, and our companions said: He is a forgiving, divorced to those who repent and whoever does not repent to God: With it and forgive what is without that for those who follow [Women: 48] and because the forgiveness of the repentant is obligatory and the performance of the duty is not required to praise and the verse is mentioned in the exposure of praise.And the second: Al -Waddoub has sayings.One of them: The loved one is the saying of the most interpreter, and it is a confident of the mental evidence, because the best is required by the self and evil with the present, and there is no less Good, the dominant must be good, so they are loved by the same.And the second: Al -Kalbi said: Waddoub is the one who turns to his guardians with forgiveness and penalty, and the saying is the first.And the third of it: Al -Azhari said: Some people of the language said that it is permissible to be a worker in the sense of an effective kneel Why did they know from his fullness in himself, his attributes, and his acts, he said: The two gravity are praised because it is the most of his remembrance if he loves his worshipers, then he is the best of him.The people are not decided by them from his kindness.And the sequence of it: Al -Qafal said: It was said that the worms may be in the sense of the dream of their saying: a dirt and a worm, and it is the obedience of the leaders who have been kind to her.الم And I domesticated the war of the vowel of the leadership and a vaccine (P-113) and its third: the throne, the locksmith said: The throne is that of the king and the authority as it is said: so that it is said: His king, and if he is not on the secret, and it is said: the threshold of so -and -so if his authority is gone, and this is A meaning is agreed upon his health, and it may be that what is meant by the bed is bad, and it will be the creation of a secret in his heaven in the end of the He knows his greatness except for him and whoever calls him.And its lord: the glorious, and it contains two readings.One of them: raising, and that is a qualification for God, His Glory, and it is the choice of the most readers and the interpreters, because the glory is one of the attributes of the Almighty, and the majesty, and that Glory be to him, chapter and symptoms between the adjective and the Sufis in this gravity, it is not forbidden.The second reader: with redundancy, which is the rule of Hamza and Al -Kisa’i, then that is the adversity of the throne, and these are they said: The Qur’an indicates that it is permissible, and it is permissible.Rather, it is a glorious Qur’an, and our opinion is that God is exalted and described the throne that it is generous, so it is not far from it to describe it as a glorious, and then they said: “God is glorified The tatioba, the glory of the power, the rule, and the knowledge, the greatness of the throne on the one hand, the greatness of its estimated, and the goodness Plain and

them, if the first was the one who was one other, and if the second was the case, no one before two judges.The second question: Our companions took this verse in the question of the creation of the verbs, and they said: There is no doubt that it is a highness that wants faith, so it is necessary for it to be the verb of the faith The verse, and if it is an act of faith, it must be an act of the disbelief of the harm that he does not say by difference.It is necessary to fall because his saying is up to the Almighty: it is an act of what he wants, he does not take over, unless he is signed, his action was without whether he did not do so, this is not a reason for him.The following question: Our companions have this verse that it is not obligatory for anyone from the costs that the bit is a weak, and it is weak because the verse is that the verse is that the verse is that the verse is that He wants, and you said: He wants to give the reward.The fifth question: Al -Qafal said: It is an act of what he wants on what he sees, and he is not supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to him, and he does not overpower him.He enters the fire of the fire, and they will not support them from it, and the disobedience will be rejected by what it is, so that it can be rewarded and immediately hurry up with the punishment if he wants and to be tormented by the one who wills from them These are things and otherwise he wants.
