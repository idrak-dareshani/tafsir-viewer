The Quranic researcher (the seven question): His saying: Do not come close to this tree, there is no suspicion in that it is forbidden, but it is in it.(The first): That this is forbidden or forbidden?There is a disagreement in it, so they said: This formula is for the end of the time It is necessary to make the memorization a right in the destiny between the two divisions, and that is only that it is made a right in the way of the side of the leaving on the side It is a sign of the prohibition from the verb or the release in it, but the release in it was fixed with the ruling of the original The origin has become an indicative of the time, they said: This is the first in this place; Because on this estimation, he will return the disobedience of Adam, peace be upon him, to the first leaving, and it is known that every time was the one that led to the grace of the Prophet, or the peace With acceptance.Others said: Rather, this is forbidden (P-6) is a prohibition, and they needed it with matters.(One of it): His saying is up to Him: and do not bring this tree as his saying: Do not bring them closer until they purify themselves [Al -Baqarah: 222] and say: Do not come to the money أحْسَنُ [الأنعام: 152] فَكَما أنَّ هَذا لِلتَّحْرِيمِ فَكَذا الأوَّلُ.(And the second): He said: So you are among the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 35] It is meaning that if you eat from it, then you have been unjust to themselves, when you did not see him when he was eaten.And the third of it: that this is forbidden, even if it was forbidden to be hidden, and Adam deserved the act of the lane In the origin of the enlightenment, but it may be carried on the prohibition of a separate way, and on the authority of the second: that his saying: So you will be from the oppressors, that is, what is wrong with you What is the first to leave it; Because if you do so, you will be brought out of the paradise in which you do not remain in it, and they are hungry, nor laugh, nor nudity to a position that is not from this, and that is not from this We greet that the exit of paradise was for this reason and his two will come if God Almighty wills.(The second research): He said, “They say his saying: Do not come close to this tree, which is forbidden by its prohibitions from the greatest, and this is weak; Because the prohibition on the proximity does not benefit the prohibition on the one; Perhaps the righteousness was in leaving its approach with the fact that if he had been carried to him, his eating would have been rewarded for him, but this appearance will be forbidden from the prohibition.As for the forbidding of the elderly, it is known for the last of the other, and it is the words of the Almighty, other than this position: when the tree tasted the tree, it was for them.With eating, he said: And each of them is indescribable Where it is a matter [Al -Baqarah: 35] So that is like a shower on the fact that he is the highest of them from the eating of all of that tree, but it is forbidden for that with this saying, He stipulated the greatest that all of that was in a more increased.* * * (The eighth question): Cheated in the tree, what is it?Farawi Mujahid and Said bin Jabir on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, what: it is righteous and the bond.It was narrated that “Abu Bakr Al -Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, asked the Messenger of God ﷺ about the tree, and he said: It is the blessed tree of the Sinbula.” Al -Saddy narrated from Ibn Abbas and Ibn Masoud that it is the generosity, and on the authority of Mujahid and Qutaidah that it is the fig, and the Lord of Anas said: It was a tree of whoever eats from it Paradise is an event.And know that in the phenomenon, it is not indicated by the concerns, so there is no need for his two people; Because it is not intended from these words that we know that the tree and what is not intended in the words, it is not obligatory for the wise to show it, but it is a person, but it was a person.Because one of us, if he wanted to evaluate the excuse for others in the delay, he said: I was running away with my hearts, because of their literature, so this is the best of this.And his name and his description remembered, so no one thinks that he was falling into the Bayan.Then some of them said: The closest to the tree is that what he has a leg and a branch, and it was said: There is no need for that; To say it to the Almighty: We have a tree of two cats [Al -Asfat: 146] with the fact that it is like the agriculture and the watermelon, so he did not go out of his going on the face Al -Mubarrad: I think that everything that has been separated for it is branches and anecdotes.I saw so -and -so, the spear of spears.And the Almighty said: Until they judge you, while a tree between them [Women: 65] and the men fight in something like this.(The ninth question): They agreed that what is meant by the Almighty said: So you are among the unjust is that if you eat, you will not have you.Because the greatest of the tree is the injustice of others, and it may be unjust by the oppression of its soul and that it is unjust (P-7), the darkness of the soul is the best and most greater.Then the people have disagreed with three sayings: The first: the saying of the stuffing who said: He was presented to the great, so it was not a shadow.The second: the saying of the disgraceful who said: It is presented to the young and then has the saying: one of them: the saying of Abu Ali al -Jubayi, and it is that it is the injustice It is made of repentance and contradiction.And secondly: Abu Hashem said, which is that he did not have his soul from where he looked at some of his rewards, so he became a shortage of what he deserved.The third: The saying of those who deny the breasts of disobedience from them is divorced, and he carried this injustice that he did what the first of him does not do it, and his example is a person: And he occupied the thunderbolt, for it is said to him: O unjust, we do not do that?If it was said: Is it permissible to describe the Prophet, peace be upon them, that they were unjust or that they were my unjust people?The answer is that the first thing is that it is not called that it is delusional.
