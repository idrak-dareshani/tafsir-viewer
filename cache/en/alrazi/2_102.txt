The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: Harbot and Marott and what we know from one of them until they are met, but we are a temptation.With the permission of God, and they learn what is harmful to them and not benefit them, and they have learned to those who have been shared by what he has in the hereafter and the misery (P-185) Know that this is another type of doves of their actions, and it is their preoccupation with magic and their acceptance of them and their prayers for them.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The devils are on the king of Solomon, and he has anxes: the first question: His Excellency said: They followed a story of the one who came to the remembrance of his remembrance, and they are the one who is the one who is in it, The Jews who were in the time of Muhammad, who were blessed and peace be upon him.Because the most abstaining of the Prophet, peace be upon him, peace be upon him, and their counts from the sentence of those who are in the world, for those who were from them in his time, and they do not believe that they are not.That great king is found by magic.Specialization.Harbot and Marut, he did not agree with the Qur’an, so this is the saying of the Almighty: And when a messenger came to them from God, he is a believer, because of them, he rejected a group of people who are the ones who have been They appeared and then told them that they followed the books of magic.And the second: The father of a Muslim (you recite), that is, you lie to the king of Solomon.A fact in the news, except that the expert is said in his news if it was a lie that he recited so and that he had recited it to so -and -so to distinguish between him and between the righteousness that is not the one who said: It is said: It was narrated from so -and -so and told that so and so on so -and -so, and that is only suitable for the news and recitation, and it is not possible to be that they were who were informing about it So all the descriptions are gathered in it.* * * The third question: The devils of gin, which is the saying of the most, was said: The devils of human beings, and it is the saying of those who speak from the dismissed, and it was said: They are the shirts of mankind and hein with.As for those who carried it on the thighs of Jinn, they said: The demons were hearing the hearing, then they guaranteed what they heard of lies, they wrapped them and their successful ones, and they will meet them, and they will meet them.The books that they read and teach the people, and that is in the time of Soliman, peace be upon him until they said: Jinn knows the unseen and they said: “This is what he knows: Except with this knowledge and with it, he will be heaven, human and wind that runs with his command.As for those who carried it on the people of the people, they said: It was narrated in the news that Solomon, peace be upon him, was buried many of the sciences that God has given him.Careful that if the phenomenon is from it, then the burials remain, so when a period of time has gone on that, the people of the hypocrites will be connected to the two of the hypocrites until they are in the way of those who are in the way Those things are appropriate for some of the faces, then after his death and the knowledge of people on those books or delusions people that it is the work of Solomon, and that it is what he did not have Things, this is the meaning of: And those who say this face on the corruption of the first saying that the devils of heaven if they were able to change the books of the prophets and their parts of the same Among the people, the trumpets benefit from all the bouquets, and that leads to stabbing in all the religions.If it was said: If you are available on that of the people of humanity, then why will it be permissible for the likes of heaven?We said: The difference is that the person who does a person must appear from some of the faces, but if this is our division from hein, which is that we increase in (p-186) Like the line of Solomon, it does not appear and remains hidden, and it leads to stabbing in all the religions.The following question: As for his saying: on the king of Solomon, he said in the king of Solomon, on the authority of Ibn Jarraj, and it was said to the covenant The devils recite the king of Soliman because they were reading from the books of magic and they said that Solomon is only that the king is the same To have the books, such as the sedation of the king of Solman.* * * The fifth question: they were corrupted in what is meant by the King of Solomon, so the judge said: The king of Solomon is the prophecy, or he enters into it the prophecy and the nobility Ali and the law.And if that is correct, then the people were brought up in a newspaper in which the magic is diligent, and it has buried it under the bed of its king, then it was removed from it after its death, and it is from it.They say to his king In reality.It is more correct for me to say: The people when they claimed that Solomon only found that kingdom in the cause of that science was that of the prosecution, like the one who has been.* * * The sixth question: the reason that they added the magic to Soliman, peace be upon him, Wahwah: one of them: that they added the magic to Solomon, as a fool of his affliction And I want to do the people in the acceptance of that of them.And the second: that the Jews did not recognize the bond of Soliman, but they would say: Rather, that king found the causes of magic.And the third of it: that God Almighty when he was hardened by Solomon, and he mixed them and expanded from them wondrous secrets, so he prevailed over the thought that he is upon him the prayer and peace be upon him.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: (?And what is the disbelief of Solomon, this is a way that he will have it for him, peace be upon him, and that is indicated that the people attributed it to the disbelief: It was narrated that some of the people of Jews said: Do you not like Muhammad who claimed that Solomon was a prophet and it was only a wickedness, so God revealed this.They claimed that they took the magic from Solomon, and God's exalted be exalted from him.He was a foolish wasting, and then the Almighty indicated that the one who acquired it from his adhesive with others, and he said: (But the two devils are disbelievers, he indicates what he said to him.Magician is like a craft for itself and attributes it to Solomon, then he explained what they have disbelieved.They teach people magic and know that the words in the magic fall from the faces: the first question: in searching for it according to the language, so we say: the mention of the family of He was kind and hidden because of his causes, and magic is the food is the food for its hidden and the kindness of its sewers.We are glorified and cheeky like the cheerful enchanting.These are the magicians, and this house is inserted from the meaning that the first carried, and it is also to be able to want the magic that it is a magic, and the magic is the lung, and the lung is the lung He returns to the meaning of hidden and from the saying of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: 153], It means from the creatures, who feeds and drinks that their saying is indicated: (?A magic is like us, and he said a story about Moses, peace be upon him, that he said to the magician: (What did you come to the magic that God will invalidate him [Yunus: 81] and he said: People and their strains [Al -A'raf: 116] This is the meaning of magic in the origin of the language.It is imagined other than its facts, and the course of the voting and the deception runs, and when it is released, and it is not restricted, the dealer, the act of the Almighty said: They have until they thought that their chains and their disobedience are seeking and said: (He imagines to him from their magic that she is seeking [Taha: 66] and he is used to do so.He came to the Messenger of God ﷺ Al -Zabarqan Bin Badr and Amr ibn al -Ahm His noon, and Al -Zabarqqan said: He and God knows that I am better than him, and Amr said: He is the time of the tranquility that is narrowed by the grace of the father, the mother of the uncle, O, I said, I said the best of what I knew, and I planted me, and I said the worst of what I knew, so the Messenger of God ﷺ said: His owner explains the problematic thing and reveals his truth with the good of his two and his phrase, if it is said: How can it be permissible.About him magic, and this said, but he intended the hidden purity of the hidden, not hiding the phenomenon, and the memorization of the magic is, but it is beneficial to hide the phenomenon?The destiny for the kindness and its goodness is the most likely, so the magic that the hearts tend to, so from this face, it is called magic, not from the face.On the Bayan, it will be able to improve what is ugly and the ugliness of what is good, so that the magic is likened to this way.* * * * * * * Know that the magic is on sections: the first: the magic of the Classeans and the Charity who were in the validity of the forever and they are people who worship the calavis and the burden of the The world, and from it the treachery, the evil, the happiness, and the sculptures, who are the ones who sent God, are the ones who have been subjected to peace be upon him.The disgraceful has agreed that their words agreed on that other people are not exalted, and he is not able to create the body, life, the color, and the taste, and they will be in the past Its interpretation and in the path of his books, and we are transmitted by those faces and look at it.Either standing by the seizure, If only God would have been effective for the body and life, then it would be a bias, and that is the biopsy, and it is necessary for it to be able to be able to do so A body, as well as that the bodies are similar, but the one who is able to be able is not valid from the doctrine of the body (p-188) and life, and it is indicated by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is.That the one of us is not able to create the body and life in order, so we are intended to be blessed in the abuse of that on it, so this abstinence is the ruling of the ruling, so there is no Participation, and there is no partner, but we are able to be able to be able, and if this is proven, it is obligatory for those who were able to estimate the ability to be excused for him.The second: That this is the ability that we have no doubt that some of them violate each other, and if we were able to be able to create the creation of generosity and life, it was not for it.The ability is more severe than the violation of some of this destiny for the bit, and if it is in that destiny of the violation in its inhabitants to create the body and life in the way of this Some of it violates some, and that it is righteous for the creation of body and life, and when it was not like that, we have notified that the Qadir with the ability is not able to create.And the second: If we have been blessed, that would be excused by the miracles of the prophecies, because if we have been brought to us, the events of the paran are in the middle of the With the ground powers, we could not cut that this is the paranormal one that appeared on the hands of the Prophet, peace be upon them.The way of magic, then the saying is dominated by the prophets from all the faces.And the third of it: If we have been blessed in the people who are able to create the body, life, and colors, that human being is able to obtain the money of the great money.Whoever claims the magic is connected to the acquisition of the despicable money with a hard -working effort, then we have learned that he lied to him, and with this way we know the corruption of what he claims to be the one who claims to be the one who claims We say: If a mother could, with some medicine, they would flip up the gold, so that it would have been either that they could with them by a few money The hardship and humiliation, or they could only with the great machines and the money, so that they had to show that to the king who is able to be able That is because that he benefited from them from the opening of the country, which is not fulfilled except by the exaggeration of the money and the aspirations, and in our knowledge by the victory of the souls and the meaning of this The saying, the judge said: This sentence has proven that the magician is not correct to be an act of something of that.Know that this is very significantly weak: either The first direction: so we say: What is indicative that everything is only God, either to be a bias, or a person who is biased.The kingdom and the heroic souls, and claimed that it is in itself, is not biased, nor a measure of the bias, so what is the evidence of the saying of this?If they said: If there is no existence, then it is necessary that it would be like God Almighty, we said: We do not hand over that because the partner in the homes does not take place in We greeted that, but it is not permissible for some bodies to be appreciated for it for its own?Its saying: the bodies are similar.If it was a body like that, then every body was like that, we said: What is the evidence for the same as the bodies, then they said: It is not a meaning for the body, but the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the body, but the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the body, It was different between it in this sense, our say: the increase in the flaws and the work of the bias is a liquidation of its attributes and is necessary for its balance, and it does not exceed that the things are not in the dispersed.Participated in some of the limbs, we have been able to be able to be able to destiny, so why did you say that the Qadir with the ability is not valid from it.His saying: Because the ability that we have is shared in this abstinence, and this abstinence is a shared judgment, so there must be a shabby cause, and there is no involvement, and no shared In capacity, we said: This is the old man with a variety of families, so we do not surrender that the abstinence is a tremendous judgment, and that is because the abstinence is not, and there is no one who does not.It is good, but it is from them that many of the rulings are not mentioned.We greeted us that it is a thorough, and why did you say: The blessed judgment must be of a shared cause, is it not that the urbanism is made in the darkness, and the darkness is in the darkness He was a lie, and in ignorance of his ignorance?We have been blessed with a blessed cause, but we do not surrender that there is no partner except as we are able Participated in a specific description, and that capacity that reconciles the creation of the body is outside that description, so what is the evidence that the matter is not?As for the first face: that is not a violation of that destiny for some destiny more than the violation of some of this destiny for the sake of this, so we say: so we say: Her morning to create the body in its formation, contrary to this destiny, but rather for the appointed special ones that are for the sake of the sake of the sake of the destiny It is known that it is not possible in the destiny of the destiny.And we look at what they mentioned to be said: the sound of the voice is not violated to the white of the ovaries.If that violator would have been forbidden to sound from the health of the validity of the validity of the darkness, contrary to the white of the white that his vision is forbidden.And when this speech was a corrupt, then what they said, and the wonder of the judge, that when he told this face about Ash'ari in the question of the vision, and its affliction, it is the question, and it is the question.He touched it in this question that is the origin of the proof of the prophecy and the response to those who have proven in the middle of God and between us.As for the second face, which is that the saying in the authenticity of the prophets does not remain with the permanence of this origin, then we say: Either the saying is in the health of the prophets, the one This is the base or not.If the first was the one who prevented the corruption of this origin by building on the validity of the prophecies, otherwise the light was signed, and if the second is, then this words fell in the whole.As for the third face: it is a saying that he says: The words are possible, and we do not say that this situation is to have any of this case, but this is not the case.The followers, how do you have what you mentioned?This is the words in the first type of magic.The second type of magic: the magic of the companions of the inspiration and the powerful soul, they said: People disagreed that the one who refers to each one is said to him: “I am” what is it?It is among the people who says: It is this structure, and for those who say: It is a body that has become in this structure, and for those who say: that it is a man.But if we say that the human being is this structure, then it is not doubted that this structure is a compound from the four mixtures, so why is it permissible to agree in some His mood is a mood of mood in a side of the aspects that requires the ability to create the body and science with the affairs that are absent from us and the excuse, and so is the words of our words, and then the words are so This structure, but if we say: The human being is the soul, then it is not permissible to say: souls are different, and it will agree in some souls, if it is for the same one.The temptation is absent from the absent secrets.The indifference is faces: the first: that the trunk that enables a person to walk upon him, even if he was a place on the ground, the one who is not possible is possible for him to walk.It is under it, and that is only that you imagine the stroke when it is strong and answered.And the second: The kindnesss gathered on the end of the pastures from the view of the red things, and the conflict of the view of the strong and the righteousness of the rituals, and that is only For the insult.And the third of it: the owner of the heal The chickens, as it likened many to the royalty in the voice and in the war with the fruit, we have proposed to its legs like the thing of the mighty ones on the leg of the rooster, then the owner of the rooster said, then the owner of this (P-190) that the generous conditions are a follower of the nose.And its seed: I gathered the nations that the linguistic supplication empty of the nose is a few deeds, the nobility With a specific question and a special wisdom.Fifthly: If you were described, you would have known that the preliminary preoccupations of the biological actions are only the negatives of the microscopic, because the power of the mockery is in the power Righteousness to verb and leave it or against it, and no one of the two parties will be more likely to be more likely to be likely to be likely to be likely to be likely and that is not the case of the unity of the verb or the same or the one who does not do the act of the verb or a beautiful or a beautiful or a good It is a dignity or a painful, so these perceptions are the prevailing prevailing of the musical powers, the predominances of the verb of the reactions of the verbs, after that, if you were, if you were, as if you were.And if these perceptions are the prevailing principles of these actions, then any repetition in their aspects of the actions of themselves and the abolition of the mediator.And its sixth: the experiment and the eyes witness that these perceptions are the preliminary principles of the clinic of the entirety of the fences in the feet, so the angry is the hardship of its mood that the mood of its mood is so much It is beneficial to him.It is narrated that some of the mourners were offered to him, so he gave the kindergarten, so he used to treat him, and he entered some of them, and he entered it with a disappearance of him, and he was not overwhelmed by him.The show, so the anger of the king was thrived and a jumping from his pumping a jumping, forcing him because of the intensity of that speech, so that the ritual is the ritual and the ritual.And if it is permissible as the perceptions of the initiatives of the inauguration of the animals in the body, then any repetition of their aspects of the inauguration of the juveniles is excessive of the body.And the sake of it: that the injury to the eye is something that the minds agreed upon, and that also achieves what we said.If you know this, then we say: The souls that do these actions may be very strong, so you seek me in these verbs of the goodness, and the abuse of the times, It is weak, so you can seek these machines.And it will be achieved that the soul if it is surrounded by the abundance of attraction to the world [the sky] was as if it was a spirit of the heavens, so it was a powerful The materials of this world, but if they are weak and attached to this brown pleasure, then it is not for it, so that the bit of this is not in this way, so this is the time of this.Its passion, in which it exceeds the effects And the sense of it was occupied by it, and the imagination followed it, and the soul was accepted by it.On the basis of these aspirations from the obedience of the duties and the applicants and the reduction of food and the obedience to the mixing of creation.And whenever these matters were, the effect was stronger, so if it agreed that the same thing is appropriate for this matter, looking at what it is, and its characteristic, the greatness The one in which the soul is that if it works with the first sunders, all its strength is occupied in that action, and if it works with the many actions, it is the same.And it was distributed on these actions, so it arrives in every one of those actions a popularity of that power and a new one of that river.Therefore, we see that two human beings are equal in the power of the rhetoric if one of them was seen with one industry and the other was filled with two industries.The one [art] is the strongest of the artists, and whoever drew the dignity on the fact of a question from the questions, then it is if it thinks about it, and it is necessary for it, and it is necessary for it, and it is necessary for it, It is when the rhetoric is spoken by the kidnapper to him, so the verb will be the most easy and good, and if it is so, then if the human being is, then the human being is the one who is a person The pleasures and the argument of desires were the powerful power of it, so that it would not be covered by it, so it is not attracted to the acquisition of the verb that is the hardship of the hardship that is attracted Strong, not in particular, and we are another, which is the same as this breath, and the preoccupation has been used to the pleasure of the first of its matter to the end of it, and it was not the same The strange verbs, they are in the first place to the first to the first (P-191).It appeared that this is the same as these aspirations, only with the extension of the generous conditions, and the violation of the mixing of creation and the innervation of the whole world.As for the righteous, if it is known, the matter is in it.Because the abuse of it is that the sense of sight, as we occupied it with matters that are appropriate for that supply, the sense of hearing, we also turn it on the matters of the affairs of that The senses, when you are confused to go to the one present, the soul was directed to it, then stronger, but if it is with a good time, it is not possible A young man with a freshness and astonishment, because if a person is lost, these words are read to the use of the spiritual matters of the spirituality I got the same condition, there is a youthful condition with freshness and astonishment, and it will get the same in the same time.The sensors, and the indifference of that action and a great grandfather, so the influence is strengthened.So the abuse, and so is the saying in the smoke, they said: It has been proven that this destiny is from the powerful power of the influence, so that it is the one who is the first Magician, which is useful for the makers and its effects of the great effects, but here we are others.The first: that the souls that have separated the eternity, in which there is a semi -affection for this soul in its strength and in its effects, then if it becomes the same as the righteousness To be attracted to it the similar souls, and that the souls will come to them, and there are no types of people from being attached to this body; The many souls are fed up with that action, and if the power is full and the power of the effect is increased.The second: that if this is the heavy sponge, if it becomes clear from the urban paradoxes, it has become subject to the excess lights of the heavenly signs and the whims of the people, so that it is this The souls are in the lights of those aspects, so it is strengthened on the strange things that are supernatural for the return, so this explained the magic of the people of the Illumlicity and the sophistication.The third type of magic: the use of the earthly signs, and know that the saying of heaven is what he denied some of those who are late, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is late The philosophy is that they did not deny the saying about it, except that they have poisoned it with the ground of the ground, and it is in its own different, from which it is good and it is a evil, so they are the good.The disbelievers and their demons, then the successor of them said: These aspects are the most valid of itself, not a bias, and there is no situation in the bias, and it is a great world of a world, And the connection of the heroic souls with it is easier than its connection to the heavens of the heavens The power to it; By the reason for its connection to those heavenly signs, but the connection is easier, because the appropriateness is between our souls and among these lands, and the one is the most important, and that is the same, and that is the same, and that is the same I complete and more than the problems between our souls and between the heavenly signs, and the power is due to the contact with the heavenly peoples is stronger; Because the heavenly signs are on the basis of the lands.Like the sun with a lime to the difficulty, and the sea with the lineage to the diameter, and the tip of the lineage to the parish.They said: These are things, and if they do not exist with them, they are a luggage, so there is no less than the involvement and the place, then the people of the industrialists and the people of the tradition are the same The ground is obtained with a small easy tank With dear ones, and the work of heaven.The righteous type of magic: the imagination and the taking of the eyes, and this take is based on submission: one of them: that the messages of sight are many, for if the ride of the shed, then the rider of the shed.He saw the sink standing and the beach is moving.This is indicated by (P-192) that the inhabitant is seen moving, and the burning is seen as a hook, and the ritual diameter is seen as a straight line, and the vilification that is managed in a way that is running away, Water is large, such as a shortage, and the small person is seen in fog great, and the saucepan of the earth that gives you the sunflower when it is great, so if it is a greatness, then it is a greatness.She was young, and the great vision of the long -term is a showless, and these things have been guided by the minds that the visionary power may see the distress of what is in the way The sentence for some of the causes.And the second: that the visionary power stands on the perfect and is completely standing if you realize the sense in a time that has some estimated, but if you realize the tranquility in the time of the time Then I realized after it a good sense, and like this, it is mixed with some, and some of the senses are not distinguished from the bone, and then the one is from it Sitting it is many lines with a different color and then turned, because the sense sees one color as if it is compounds from all of these colors.And the third of it: that the soul if it is busy with something, then perhaps when the sense is attended by something other and does not feel the sense of it, as it is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the human being Another person may throw him and speak to him, so he does not know him and does not understand his words; And since his heart is busy with something else, and so is the view in the mirror, then he may be intended to see a garden in his eyes, and he will see it, and he does not see what is greater than it, He is his affliction, or with the cararis of his members who meet the mirror, and perhaps he was intended to see the surface of the mirror, is it a matter of or not, so he does not see anything in what is in the time.If you know this old man, it is easy for that, as this is a way that this type is from magic The views of it, and take their eyes to it even if the workers are tempted by that thing and the dignity of it; He did something else in a speedy speed, so that work remains hidden to miss the two things: one of them: their assumption of the first command.The second: the speed of the two years of this work, and then, something else appears to them other than what they are waiting for, so they like it from it, and it is not that it is not The circumccupuations is distressed against what he wants to do, and the souls and the bonds are moved to the other than what he wants to leave, so that you can see all of what he does, so what is the one who does not do so They say: The people are taken with the eyes; Because with the right to take the eyes to the other side in which he is assassinated, and whenever he takes it to the eyes and the devices, and his attraction to it, so it was the rest of it.His work, and whenever the circumstances that benefit the sense of sight are a type of vinegar, this work was better, for example, the people are sipped in a place, The eyesight benefits the eyesight as a shame and an old man, as well as the hard injustice, as well as the fierce, the strong colors that benefit the sight, as the shame, the cores, and the colors of the darkness.The powerful power is on its ways, so this is the gathering of the saying in this type of magic.The fifth type of magic: the wondrous works that appear from the installation of the installed machines on the HD It is later, and one of them kills the other, and an infidel on a horse in his hand with a trumpet, whenever a period of day goes away from the day, the trumpet is not the same as the one who touches it, and the one who touches it, and the one who touches it, Romans and India do not separate the view between it and the human being, until they photographed it laughing and crying, until it is separated from you The Levant, this is the face of the fun of the clouds, and the magic of the magic of Pharaoh was from this atheist, and from this section, it will be installed.The elderly restored, which is that a great ease is made with an easy light, and this is in the truth that is not intended to be prepared for the sake of magic, because it has reasons (P-193).He looked at her, who is able to see it, but he was not able to see it, but the individual after the individual, after the time The work of “Araja’ius” is the musician in the height of the ancient Augurim when he renewed it, and that he agreed to him that he was a good man, from the one who is a good one, from the authority of the ritual.The shouting of the rochet, and the rochet is a kind of kindness, and he scrubed a grief with a disagreement of the path of the rochet, and the rochet was brought in it with the lengths of it So he eats it with his need, and some of her are preferred from his need, so this musician stands there, and he hopes that the state of that is the jurisprudence, and the knowledge of the man The zipper of the seed is a coercion of hurt and resting until the good was promoted and came to him with what he eats; So he was kind to the work of a machine that resembles the whistle, if the wind receives it, and that yellow led it, and it is still tired of that until it was trusted, and it was done with it, and it is clear.She was coming to that chick; Because she thinks that there is a spawning of her sexes, when he was correct for him what he wanted to appear as the human being and baptized to the whole He asked about the night in which he was buried in the "Satrkhs", the righteous people who are in the midst of that hook; It was told that he was buried on the first night of a father, so he took a picture of a hollow glass on the authority of the pair of the plain A dome, and commanded them to open it at the beginning of August, and the voice of the platform shows the scourge of the wind in that image, and the rochet was coming with the time That dome is every day from that Zeaton, and people believed that it is one of those burials, and there are many types in the chapter that there are many types that cannot be made in this.The sixth types of magic: the use of the medication, such as it is made in its food some of the substances that are not in the mind, We have the heart of the garden, if the human being, his mind is born and his accent decreased.And know that there is no path to the denial of the properties, then the impact of the magnet is a witness, but the people have increased in it, and they mixed the truth in the lie, and the falsehood.The four -year -old type of magic: taught the heart, which is that the magician claims that he has known the great name, and that the gin is obeying it and destroying it, then it is more The poisonous for that was the weakness of the mind, a little, the distinction.Fear has weakened the sensitive powers; So, the magician can do then, then he will follow, and whoever has tried the things and knows the conditions of the people And hide the secrets.The eighth type of magic: the pursuit of the seam, and the structure of light, light, gentle faces, and that is great in the people, so this is the sentence of words in the sins of the magic And his varieties, and God knows.* * * The loyal question: in the sayings of Muslims that these types are they are able or not?As for the disgraceful, they agreed on its denials except the desperate type to imagination, and the desired to feed some of the spoils, and the descending to the harmony, The first fifth was denounced, and perhaps they disbelieved those who said about it and the goodness of it.As for the people of the Sunnah, they have come to be able to enable the witches to fly in the air, and the human being turns into a human being, and the human being is a human being, except that they said: God is the best of God.When the witch reads a special tender and a certain word.As for the influence in that astronomy and stars, no.As for the philosophy, the stars, and the Sabean, they said to them about what he preceded his report (P-194) and our companions took over the corruption Hadith, It is obligatory to be a capacity, and the thing that ruled the mind is that it is able, but it is true that it is an estimated to be the one who is unable All of the possibilities, then all the places are destined to God Almighty, and if something of those destinies was found in another reason that is necessary for the sake of this God Almighty with that destiny, so the jihad is a reason for the miracle of God, and it is referred, so you have proven that he will be transmitted by the occurrence of something from the abundance of God What the Sabeel said, they said: If this is proven, then we claim that it is the reason for the occurrence of this paranormal by conducting the habit at the magic of magic Magician with the Qur’an and news.As for the Qur’an, it is the Almighty in this verse: and what they are in it is from one of God, except with the permission of God, and the discretion is indicative Founded and atheistic: One of them: What was narrated that peace be upon him is magic, and that magic has worked in it until he said: “He will imagine me that I say the thing, and I do not say, Do it, “and that a woman is a magician, and she made that magic under the shepherd of the well, so when he was broken, that is removed from the Prophet, The two sins are due to it.And secondly: that a woman came to Aisha - may God be pleased with her - and she said to her: I am a wire, so is I a repentance?She said: What will you warm?She said: I went to the position in which Harut and Marott are in Babel to seek the knowledge of magic; He said to me: O nation of God, do not choose the torment of the hereafter with the command of the world, so I died, and they said to me: Go to me, and I am on me for that ash I said: I do not do.And I came to them, and I said: I did, and they said to me: What did you see when you did?I said: I saw nothing.They told me: You are on the head of an order; Fear God and do not do, so I died; And they said to me: Go, so do, so I went, and I did, and I saw as if a horse was convincing to the new ones, he came out of my hope, so he returned to the sky, so he came to them, so he came to them, so he came to them, so he came to them, so he came to them, so he came to them Your faith has come out of you, and you have improved magic, so I said: What is it?They said: You do not want anything, so you will imagine it in your illusion, except, and I passed through my soul with love, so if I am with love, I said: He planted and broke out from his hour, and I said: He laughed.So they broke out from his hour, and I said: He was overwhelmed, and I do not want anything that I photographed in myself, but he did, and Aisha said: You have no repentance.And the third: What they remember from the many tales in this section, which is famous.As for the disgraced, they took his denials with his wings: one of them: the words of the Almighty: the witch does not succeed as it comes [Taha: 69].And the second: His Excellency said in a description Muhammad ﷺ: The unjust said that you follow only a man who was enchanting [Al -Furqan: 8], and if peace be upon him, he would be enchanting, they would not be fulfilled by this.And the third of it: that if it is permissible from the magic, how can the miracle distinguish from magic It is reconciled with this indicative.* * * Fifth question: that the knowledge of magic is uncomfortable and not prohibited: the investigators agreed upon that; Because the knowledge of itself is a mourning, and also for the general saying of the Almighty: Is it equal to those who know and those who do not know [Al -Zumar: 9] and because the magic is not the magic The difference was between him and between the miracle, and the knowledge is that the miracle is incapable and obligatory Magnary is obligatory, and what is a duty is how to be forbidden and dignified.* * * The sixth question: that the magician may atone or not, the jurisprudence is costly that the witch is atone for or not?It was narrated (P-195) on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ that he said: Among the nation is that whoever believes that the cries are the display of this world, and it is the Creator because of the inheritance, the good and the evil in it, for it is the disbeliever of the first From magic.As for the second type: It is that he believes that the spirit of the human being in the description and power is to where it is able to find bodies, life, capacity, and the abundance of the abundance, The appearance of the nation’s consensus is also on its atonement.As for the third type: that the magician believes that it has been informed of the description and the readings of the righteous and the smoke of some medicine, so that the God of God creates the Lord of the Lord The path of the habit of the bodies, life and mind, and the abomination of structure and shape, for the disgraceful, they agreed to atone for those who permit that; They said: Because with this belief, it cannot know the sincerity of the prophet and the messengers.This is a ritual of saying.For a saying that he says: The human being, if he claimed the prophecy and was false in his claim, is that it is not permissible from God to the transgression of these things on his hands; Like the dressing, but if the prophecy does not call the prophecy and the appearance of these things on his hands, it is not led to the stirring, for the right is the right The right to obtain these things with the claim of prophecy, and the invalid is not for him these things with the claim of prophethood.As for the birds of the types that we have prepared from magic, he does not doubt that it is not atoning.If it was said: The Jews, when they added the magic to Solman, said God is upholstered by him: He did not disbelieve Soliman, and this indicates that magic is disbelieving on release, and also he said: But the devils are disbelieved, and the people are known to know.It is necessary for magic to be unbelievers.It was narrated from the owners that they do not know one of the magic until they say: Rather, we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve while indicating that the magic is a disbelief on the launch of the situation.In her sincerity, one image, so we carry it on the magic of those who believe the deity of the stars.* * * The seven question: Is it obligatory to kill them or not?.As for the first type: it is that it is imitated in the makers, as the gods are managed.The second type: It is that the magician may become a looseness with the ability to create the bodies, and the creation of life, capacity, mind, and the ritual of Ashkal The Muslim, if he brings this criticism, was like a closer.If he was killed.It was narrated from Malik and my father Hanifa that he does not accept his repentance, because he was Muslim, and his Islam accepts; For him, peace be upon him: “We are the one who recklessly.” As for the third type: it is that God is fulfilled that he is the same as the creation of bodies and life and the abolition of the form and the body when the readers, some of the rituals, The witch believes that it is possible to reach the events of the bodies and life and the change in the creation with this way, and we have mentioned that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: The belief can not be met with miracles on the truth of the prophet, and this is a knife; Because it is said: The difference is that the claimant of the prophecy, if it is true in his claim, was that he will come to these things, and if it is a liar, he will be excused for him, so that he will be pleased with that.If it is proven that it is not a disbeliever and it is proven that it is possible to fall, then if the witch comes with something of that, then if he believes that he would have been informed of him; Because he was judged by the banner of his being permissible, and if his sanctity is lost, then the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - is lost He kills most of the leaders, and if he said: I was magic, and my magic may kill and may not be killed.So the likeness of a pillar, and if he said: I magic, others, then he agreed to his name, so he made a mistake that answers the religion feared in his money; Because it was proven by his declaration, except that the sane person believes it, then the sane person is obligated to them.This is the detail of the ghost of the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - and Al -Hasan narrated the son of Zayad on (p -196) Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, and he said: It is not followed and does not accept his saying: I leave the magic and repent from it, so if he acknowledges that he is a wasting, then his blood has resolved, and if he witnessed, he witnessed that he is a wicked or a ride or a ride and a sly and a ride and a ride Sahir was killed and not It is followed, and if I acknowledge that I was once escaped, and I left that time before it was accepted from him and did not kill, and Muhammad ibn Shuafi said: On the authority of Abu Hanifa in the magician: He is killed and not received, and that was not in the home of the wound, so he said: He was killed.And our companions were embarrassed that when it was proven that this type is not atoning, it is immoral, for if it was not crochet about the right of others, the truth was the one.The second: that the wickedness of the Jews is not killed; Because he, peace and blessings be upon him, is a man from the Jews who are said to him: Ladid ibn Esam, and a woman who is a good man who is said to be said: Zaynab, so he did not kill them; The believer must be like that; For him, peace and blessings be upon him: “They have what the Muslims are, and they have what is on the Muslims.” And the father of Hanifah, may God have mercy on him, said with his words: one of it: what was narrated from Ibn Omar: that a neighbor of the savage of its magic, and its sacrifice, and its savage, and it was made.So Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd commanded and killed it, and he informed Uthaman, and he denied it, so Ibn Umar brought him and told him her command, so if you are, then you are.Because she was killed, then.And the second: What Amr ibn Dinar narrated that he and the book of Omar - may God be pleased with him - narrated that they kill every Sahir and witch; We kill us three scents.And the third of it: Ali ibn Abi Talib said: These norms are the priests of the old man, so whoever comes as a priest believes in him with what he says: He has lost what he has come to.And the answer: Perhaps the magician who was killed was from the disbelief, because the story of the situation is sufficient in its honesty, one image, and the elders of the magic, the meaning And the wondrous machines based on the scourge of the imaginations, and the building on the Handic proportions, and also the saying of the illusion of the darkening of the disagreement and the distress of the distress and the distress In it, the argument is the argument of the belief in it, and it is walked with the structure and the dignity, and it is fought in the rhythm of the division after the connection, and it is deluded that it is the right of it.So all of that is not atoning, and so is the saying in the burial of the dirty things in the role of people, as well as the saying in the illusion that the heaven do this, and the saying of this, as well as the saying The age is in the food, because something of that does not reach the limit of disbelief, and the murder is not obligatory.Physical.As for the saying of the Exalted: But those who disbelieve are infidels, they teach people magic, so the appearance of the verse requires that they disbelieved for the sake of the sake of the magic.Because the ruling on the description is upset with the upper, And you know what is not a disbelief that does not have to disbelieve, so the verse is indicative of that the magic is infidelity, and that the magic is also disbelief, and for those who are forbidden, and for those who are forbidden to say: That the ruling on the description is upset with the high, but the meaning is that they disbelieved and they are with that, they teach people magic, then it is said: this is a problem; Because God Almighty has informed in the last of the verse that the owners teach people magic, and if he had learned the magic, a disbeliever would have been disbelieved, and the owners ’atonement, When it was proven that the angels with their families are infallible, and also, because you have indicated that it is not everything called magic, so it is disbelief.We said: The blessed memorial is not a year in all its heavens, so we carry this magic, which is the disbelief on the first type of things that are the same, and it is the same.The divine of the makers and the use of them in the purification of miracles and the paranormal habits, for this magic is disbelieving, and the demons but they disbelieved to come to them with this magic.(P-197) As for the place, we do not surrender that when this type is from the magic, but perhaps they may teach the man of the types of types of what the Almighty said: So they know what they are from them The woman is his wife and also, so it is possible to say: They know this type, but this type is learned, but it is disbelief if the teacher is intended His truth and his universe are right, but he teaches him to be rejected by him, for this learning is not a disbelief, and the angels have been learned, it was for the sake He was seized for what he said, a story about them: and what we know from one of them until they say, but we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve, but the people who know the people who know They are intended to do the truth of these things, so the difference appeared.The eighth question: a navigator, the son of Katheer, Adem, and Abu Amr, with Tshdid, "but" and "Al -Shiyatin" with the installation of the name of "and for the name of" And “the devils” by raising, and the meaning is one, and so is in the breath: but God threw [Al -Anfal: 17], but God killed them [Al -Anfal: 17] and the choice is that if he was the one who was a good, then if he was the one who was.Other than wow, the fear is better, and the face is in it that “but by lightness” is a kindness, so it does not produce the waw to communicate the words, and the tightening is not.Because she does a work, "if".* * * As for his saying, the Almighty: What was revealed to the owners is the door of Harbot and Marut, in his books: the first question: The one, then these they disappeared in it on three sayings: the first saying: that it is a kind of “magic”, meaning they teach the people of magic, and they know what they are.Also.And secondly: It is a kindness His saying: What are the two tendencies, that is: they followed what the two devils recite the king of Solomon, and what was revealed to the owners; Because the magic is from it what is disbelief, which is followed by the demons, and it is what its influence in the separation between the woman and his wife, which is the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come to the one who has come to you On the authority of the Jews, they followed both the two things, and they did not limit themselves to one of them.And the third of it: that its position is an entertainment on the king of Solomon and its estimation: the devils are not recited by the king of Solomon, and on what I have come to the king A Muslim, may God have mercy on him, and denied the owners that the magic is descending from them, and he was broken upon him by his face Hope, and that is not permissible; Because magic is disbelieving and messing around, and it is not worthy of that.The second: that his saying: But the demons are disbelievers, they teach people magic, indicating that the magic is infidelous, and if it is established in the angels, it is that they know that the angels will teach The disbelief is obligatory, and that is false.The third: It is also not permissible in the prophets to send to teach magic, as well as in the angels with the first way.The four: that magic is added only to the infidelity, immorality, and the reciprocated demons, and how is it added to God what is forbidden by it and the rest of it with the punishment?And the magic is only the false falsehood, and the habit of God has come to his heights, as he said in the story of Moses, peace be upon him: What you have come to the magic is that God is God: May God have mercy on him in the interpretation of the verse is another approach that contradicts the words of the most interpreters, so he said: Just as the demons attributed the magic to the magic to the king He was acquitted of it, so they attributed what was revealed to the owners to the magic with the fact that the one who descended from them was innocent of the magic, and that is because it was the one that was Religion and supplication to good, but they knew people with their saying: but we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve in confirmation of their resurrection, and the one who is the one who has been.You seek and seek (P -198), it is contrary to that, and they learn from them - that is: from the temptation and the infidels - the destruction of what they separate from it, and it is between it, and it is between it The report of the father of a Muslim.The second face: that it is “what” in the sense of the norm, and it is kind to the words Magic; Because the magician was adding the magic to Solomon, and it was claimed that what was revealed to the owners with the door of Harbout and Marut, so God is upon them, and he said: One of the norms is also, meaning: no one is known, but they are more severe The end.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Until they say, but we are a temptation, that is, a luminous and a boredom, so do not disbelieve, and it is like you: I did not say that I did so, so I said: Such, that is, what I commanded, but I warned him of it.And know that these sayings, even if they are good, except that the first saying is better than it, and that is because he complied with his saying: and what was revealed to him is what he follows from his first Except for a separate evidence, but his saying: If the magic was revealed to them, then the magic of that magic is God Almighty.We said: The disappearance of the adjective of the thing may be for the sake of being absent in its introduction in the existence, and it may be for the sake of the unprepared from it as the poet said: For the good, but the second said: The teaching of magic is an infidel; To say it to the Almighty: But the devils are disbelievers, they teach people magic, so the answer: I have shown that it is a state of a state, and it is sufficient in its righteousness, and it is a single image, and it is a single image, and it is a single image, and it is a single image The magic of the one who says with the deity of the shawls, and its intention is that of that learning is proven that that gold is true.The third saying: It is not permissible to send the prophets - peace be upon them - to teach magic, as well as the angels.We said: We do not surrender that it is not permissible to send the prophets - peace be upon them - to teach him in terms of the preservation of that learning to be the one.The fourth saying: The magic is added to the infidelity and the murder, so how is it added to God to the exalted of what is forbidden by it?We said: A separation between the work and between the learning, why is it not permissible for work to be deed from it?As for his teaching of the prophecy of his corruption, it is a matter of it.المَسْألَةُ الثّانِيَةُ: قَرَأ الحَسَنُ: (مَلِكَيْنِ) بِكَسْرِ اللّامِ, وهو مَرْوِيٌّ أيْضًا عَنِ الضَّحّاكِ وابْنِ عَبّاسٍ, ثُمَّ اخْتَلَفُوا, فَقالَ الحَسَنُ: كانا عِلْجَيْنِ أقْلَفَيْنِ بِبابِلَ People learn magic, and it was said: They were two men who were blessed.And the readers of the conquest of the lam, and they were the owners of a heaven, and Harbot and Marut Asman for them, and it was said: They are Gabriel and Michael, and the peace of them Those who broken the mother, they were broken by wings: one of them: that he does not fit the angels, teaching magic.And the second: How can the owners be removed with his saying: If we would have revealed a king, he would have spent the matter, then they will not look [Al -Anam: 8].And the third of it: If the owners would have been revealed, he would not make them in the image of the two men, or he would not make them like that.In order to be applied and applied to people, and it is not permissible, and if it is permissible for that, it is not permissible that every one of the people whom we see is not in the truth Malakha?And if it does not make them in The image of the two men was praised in his saying: And if we had made it a king, we would have made it a man [Al -Anam: 9].The answer to the first is that we will show the face of the rule in the removal of the angels to teach the magic, and the second (P-199) is that this verse is general and the readers of the angel Especially, and the private is presented over the year, and for the third that God Almighty revealed them in the image of two men, and the duty of the costs in the time of the prophets was not to be brought up The human being is a human being, as he is in the time of the Messenger - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - the duty of those who witnessed the life of the dog was not to be cut off from the authority of the authority, but he would not be cut off from the authority of the In it.المَسْألَةُ الثّالِثَةُ: إذا قُلْنا بِأنَّهُما كانا مِنَ المَلائِكَةِ فَقَدِ اخْتَلَفُوا في سَبَبِ نُزُولِهِما, فَرُوِيَ عَنِ ابْنِ عَبّاسٍ أنَّ المَلائِكَةَ لَمّا أعْلَمَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِآدَمَ وقالُوا: I make in it someone who spoils it and shed blood, so God Almighty answered them by saying: I know what you do not know [Al -Baqarah: 30] Then God, may God bless you The angels, and they are the ruins of the writers, and they were wrapped in their tanks, so the angels wrapped from them and from the rest of God for them, with what they appeared from them, from them The magic worked as a clogging of the angels, so God Almighty wanted to launch the angels.The earth, so test them, so they chose Harbot and Marott, and installed the desire of mankind, and they descended them and their end for the evil, killing, adultery, and drinking The best of the women, which is the flower, is its strains from itself, so she refused to obey them until after the idol worshiped, otherwise after the wine, then the wine, so that the wine is, so it is the time, so it is the same On them, they obeyed her in all of that, and when they are on the drink and the worship of the idol, he entered a questioner with them, and she said: If this is the same as the questioner, then what is the questioner, then what is the question of us, If you wanted to reach me, then kill this man, then they refused from him and then occupied his killing.He was dedicated, broken, and lost to God Almighty, so they would have made them among the torment of the world and the torment of the hereafter, so the deception of the torment of the world, and they are tormented by the hearts of the one who is stuck, People magic, then they have in the flower: The first saying: that God is exalted, when the owners affected the lust of the children They were tied to the earth, until it was what it was, then the flower raised the flower and its astronomy to their position from the sky, wiping them over what they witnessed from them.The second saying: That the woman is a wrapped one of the people of the earth, and it is imposed after drinking the wine, and killing the soul, and the worship of the idol, and then they taught it the name that they were in the name of the name, so that they were the name of the name of the name, so the name of the name was to the name, so the name of the name was to the name, so the name of the name was to the name, so the name of the name was to the name, so the name of the name was to the name, so the name of the name was to the name of the name, and the name of the name, and the name of the name.She went to the sky, and its name was “with a bisht”, so God cried it, and made it the flower, and he knew that this novel is pardoned, and it is not an acceptable; Because it is not in the book of God what is indicated by that, but in it is what he invalidates from his faces: the first: what is presented from the significance indicating the infallibility of all the angels.And the second: that their saying: They are good between the torment of the world and between the torment of the hereafter as a corruption, but rather the first was to choose between the repentance and the torment; Because God Almighty is good among themselves who have been blessed with the length of his life, so how to reckon them with that?.And the third of it: that one of the most beautiful things is their saying: they teach magic in the event of their being tormented, and they call for him while they are punished, and when this is the same The reason for their removal is its faces: one of it: that the magician has many in that time, and the doors were discouraged in the magic, and they called the Prophet, So God sent these two owners to know the people of magic, until they can be able to oppose those who were the ones who were calling This is one of the best purposes and purposes.And the second: that the knowledge is the form of the miracle, contrary to the magic (P-200) is standing on the knowledge of the miracle of the mmpress and the way of the magic, and the people were ignorant, and the people were ignorant, and the people were ignorant, and the people were ignorant of the people, Jarm, this was excused by the knowledge of the roughness of the miracle, so God sent these two kingdoms to define what the magic is the magic; For this excess.And the third of it: It is not possible to say: the magic that signs the difference between the enemies of God and the familiarity between the guardians of God was permissible for them or a delegate To teach the magic for this syntax, then the people have learned from that of them, and they used it in evil and the rhythm of the difference between the guardians of God and the first of God.And the one that is good: that the knowledge is made with everything good, and when the magic was forbidden from it, it must be a well -known one; Because who is not a perceived, he forbade the prohibition on him.Fifth: Perhaps the jinn had some types of magic, and human beings were not appreciated by the same, so God sent the angels to teach the good news Jin al -Jin.And its sixth: It is permissible for that to be tightened in the cost of which is where he taught him what he could have to connect with him to the urgent pleasure, then he was forbidden, then he was forbidden to do so The end of the hardship; So the further reward is required, as the people of Talat are dominated by the river.On what he said: Whoever drinks from him, he is not from me and whoever does not feed him, then he is from me [Al -Baqarah: 249], so you have proven with this face that he does not go away from God Magician, God knows.The following question: Some of them said: This is the extent, but it was located in the time of Ades, peace be upon him.Because if they were owned by the vicinity of human beings, then this is a messenger, then a messenger in their time must be a miracle of it, and it is not permissible for him to be.Because it has been proven that he is not sent the Messenger to the king.The fifth question: “Harbot and Marott” is the kindness of the two kingdom Some of them did not leave, and Al -Zuhri read: “Harbout and Marut” by lifting on: they are Harut and Marut.As for the saying of the Exalted: What is known from one until they say, but we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve, so know that he is the Almighty’s condition The warning of the hardship from doing it, and it is their saying: but we are a temptation, so do not disbelieve and the intention is here with the temptation that is from the one who is distinguished by As they said: I fled the gold with the fire, if it is shown on the fire, so that the pure is distinguished from the distress, and the faces have shown us in that it is how it is good.Magician, so what is meant is that they do not know one of the magic, and do not describe it for anyone and do not reveal to him the faces of the impermissible until he is the advice for him, so he will be clear.Fita, that is: this is the one who describes it for you, and if it is the supply of it, it is distinguished by the difference between the magic and between the miracle, but it is possible for you And the sins, so that after you, you should use it as you are forbidden, or you will be connected to it to any of the urgent symptoms.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: They learn from them what they separate from it between the woman and his wife, and he has anxes: the first question: they mentioned in this way: The first: That this separation is that it is possible that that magic is influenced by this separation, so he will become an infidel, and if he becomes
