them.(P-50) Know that the interpretation is back and we remember the kindness in it in the questions: the first question: I know that the cost of what is contemplated and found it The cultivation and pests, so he formulated it from the uncleanness of something in a place until it came out crying, not to the separation, but it is dispersed from the wildness of the love to be merciful, as it is the one The crying overwhelmed him to be merciful, then he was not merciful, but the capabilities were not intense, and he was not tightened in the womb, then he did not spend a few periods of time until he was in the way With the signs, then a little spent until they became Muslim to a professor who loves him in the book and strikes him with the teaching, and so until he reached the dream, then the dream is then, then the dream is then, then With the minds of the mind and the mandate, then the cost becomes like the consequence, he says: Whoever does in these actions with what I have not issued!He did not think until he was nurtured, and he found a scientist who does not resemble the two scientists, and a grace that does not resemble the two people, and he knew that all of you were The insult, but his truth is the pure of generosity and mercy.So he made his heart a dwelling to the Sultan of his knowledge, as if the truth said: My servant has revealed my knowledge in your heart until it does not come out of it, and it will be done from it, and it will come from it.The servant: O Lord, you have sent down the love of the breast in my heart and then I brought it out, and so is the love of the father and the mother, the love of the world and its lusts and the out of all.As for your love and your customs, do not bring them out of my heart, then when the knowledge and love remained in the land of the heart, he exploded from this to the bouquet of the rituals, and the righteousness of the The eye received the advertisement from it, and who arrived at the ears from which he woke up the survivors of the merits and their praise, and so in all the members and the wounds, then God said: Your heart is like paradise for me and I went in it in it that is permanent, and in it, and you are with your cushion and your shortcomings, so you did this, for I am the first of the existence and the mercy of the He said: They have their Lord with the gardens of Aden that runs from the rivers, but rather as if the merciful, the Most Merciful, says: From it with generosity and generosity, then I did not make this one permanent mold from it, so that it will be its inhabitants and its immortalism as it is in it.The second question: the part is a name for what is sufficient for it, and the wet cattle is shaken by the wet.Meaning: One of them is that it is given to the abundant penalty, without a shortage.The second: It is an upholstery that gives it to what is sufficient for it, so there is nothing in itself, except that it is required, and it will be a hall, according to what he said: and you have what you want.[31] The second question: He said: Their reward, so the penalty added to them, and the absolute addition is indicated by the property, so how is the collection between it and between it: His grace [Fatir: 35] and the answer: As for the people of the Sunnah, they say: If the king said the honorable: Whoever moves his stain, I will give him a thousand, so this is a thousand.The language and according to the place, not according to the subordination, and its saying: Their reward is sufficient in its honesty, this meaning, and as for the one who is the one who said: We have made the house of the residence from its grace that the word “from” is to call the end, so the meaning is that the investigator of this heaven is, but it is caused by the grace of you, for you And you gave us the ability and the mind and removed excuses and gave the softening, otherwise we did not reach this path.If it was said: If there is no right (P-51), one has to do it in your mind, then what is the reason for the commitment like this year?We said: Do you ask about his nomadicid if our numbers?Or about his day, the day when the cost?Or about it in the tomorrow of the resurrection?If you asked about the evening, as if he says: I am a balanced from the integrity, and the extended is fill in the benefits, so if he did not create the creation, then this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the creation, so that this is the one who is the one who is the creation, so that it is the one who is the creation, so that it is the one who is the creation, so that it is a lost.He has money and no children for him, for he is buying the slave and the jewelry, so that they can benefit from his money, so he will be his pursuit of the house God, “As for Al -Youmi, there is no need after the hurricane.The mercy is first.As for tomorrow, I am in their place with the judgment of the promise and the news, so how do I not fulfill that.The following question: In his saying: When their Lord is a kind: one of them: some of the jurisprudence said: If he said: There is nothing for me on the sole of it, so this is the time Wading, and if he said: There is nothing for me when he was a scourge to the valleys without the debt His saying: When their Lord is beneficial to him that he is a good and a good hand, and if he said: He would not be upon me, then it is a declaration of religion, and the eye is the honor of the religion: Their Lord informs that it is like the certainty, the present, the one who is present.The guarantees are better if the destruction is portrayed in it, and this is in the right of God to be referred to a referred, so we do not have the crime of our sayings: the liability is that there is better than the guarantees.And the second: If the temptation is located in the country, So you put your money at the imam of the place on the way of the valleys, you have passed the heart of the heart, so the temptation will fall into the country of your body, and then, and then the one who is afraid of you.On it, put your safety and your safety for me, so I write a book for you with a book that is filled in the naviga to the Day of Resurrection, and it is his saying: Grandfather of them with the Lord of God What is for him while he is in the arrival of resurrection.And the third of it: He said: When their Lord has a great evil, as if he is the Almighty saying: I am the one who was your Lord first when you were a bone whistling of the yellow of the And the capacity, so I created you and gave you all these things, so you were divorced, I gave you these things, and I did not lose you, and I will see that if you have given you, and I will make it.I am making it, not this is what is not.The fifth question: His saying: their garden with their Lord is gardens in which they say: one of them: that he met the gathering with the gathering, and it is necessary for the sake of the one who said: For his daughters or his servants: If you enter these two households, then you are like this, so this is carried out that each one will enter one of them as a house, and from Abu Ya` They enter the two households, and on this, if these two servants are.And the first saying: Pay their shock in their ears and cheat their clothes [Noah: 7] So the first saying is between that the reward for each is the cost of one who is a good time Paradise is the same as the world, including the ten times, such as the narration, and it is indicated by the Almighty saying: and a great king (P-52) [Man: 20] Heaven, as it was narrated from Abu Yousf and upon him the Qur’an, because he said: And whoever fears the shrine of his Lord two gardens [Al -Rahman: 46] then he said: and from the one who is one of them [62] For the goods, and the reason for it is that he cried from the fear of God, and that crying, but he came down from four eyelids: two without the two, so he deserved the jinn of the jinn.He has four gardens, to put him crying from four eyelids, and then he is the high of fear in his saying: And whoever fears the shrine of his Lord is two gardens and the last of the good Because he has seen the surah by saying: That is for those who fear his Lord and in which he indicates that he must have been from the pharaohs of fear, but before the work, then the one who has the fear of the good is the good The fear of the cells, as this worship does not fit that presence.The sixth question: its saying: a person who benefits the residence that they do not come out of it [Al -Jathiya: 35], and what they are from it with graduates [Al -Hijr: 48], they do not want from it [108] The place was established, “It was narrated that the gardens of an enemy and the extension of heaven”, and it was said: Aden of the host Generation, paradise, paradise, or paradise, then if they are from the jinn, then they are specialized in the speed of the movement, and they will float the world in one hour, so it is that it is the one who said: His conflicts in the end of the speed.Like the movement of heaven, with the fact that it is a house of residence and a number, or from the paradise, it is that paradise in terms of if the sane person saw it becomes like the madman, for the sake of God From Paradise, because it is a paradise and a veneration that protects you from the fire, or from the garden, because the cost is in the paradise in the end of the blessing, and it will be like the madman, neither of the madman, neither of the jinn neither They see a sun or a tag.[Man: 13] The seven question: Its saying: a reference is made until the running water is kind of resting, and from that view of the running water increases light in the sight, but he said: You were a neighbor, you were alive on what he said: And worship your Lord until the sky comes to you [Al -Hijar: 99] So it is obligatory to be the ritual of my neighbor to the forefront, then he said: Singing, and that is because the rhetoric in the two gossip, either because of the blood of the running water, remember the righteous, the righteous, or by the burden and the many, so it is mentioned, so it is mentioned in the The rivers of the definition, so it will be displayed to the mentioned rivers in the Qur’an, and it is the river of water, milk, honey, and wine.A river, but the great is the one who is called a river with the same saying: He was harnessed for you the king to run in the sea with his command, and he mocked you for the ritual: 32] the sea.The eighth question: Know that it is up to the heaven, followed by what is better than paradise, and it is the first and the satisfaction secondly, and it was narrated that it is - upon him - the peace of the peace Paradise, and the consent of God is better than paradise.50 As for the first adjective: it is the immortality, so know that God has described the paradise once with the daughters of Aden, and once with the years of the nicknames, and once in the house of peace, and this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Because you have installed your faith from three things: mastery, saying and action.As for the second adjective: it is satisfaction, know that the servant is created from the body and spirit, the paradise of the body is the paradise of the Sufis, and the paradise of the spirit is the satisfaction of the Lord The world of the body and its matter of the mind of the mind and the soul, so it is not a crime that started with paradise and made the end of God is the consent of God, then he is the best of God for them (P-53) Because the eternal is the influencer in the event, and the modern does not affect the eternal.The ninth question: Rather, he said: May God be pleased with them, and he did not say: The Lord is satisfied with them, nor the name of the names; Because the most heavens A meal and a majesty for the memorization of God, because it is the name that indicates the self and the attributes of its families.The servant is because the educator may be satisfied with a few, but God's memorials will benefit the absence of the majesty and the hibor, and in the same way as this presence, the absence of the whole is the same Fullness, his saying: May God be pleased with them.He benefits the abuse of the servant's action from this side.The question is the tenth: they disagreed with his saying: God be pleased with them, and some of them said: It is with me to be satisfied with their work, and some of them said: The intention is that he is satisfied, and he is satisfied.Satisfaction with the actor is not satisfied with his verb, and this is the closeness, and as for his saying: They are satisfied with it, so what is meant is that they were satisfied with what is permissible for them from the naked and reward.As for his words, the Almighty: That is for those who fear his Lord, and he has angios: the first question: fear in obedience is a good condition.Perhaps the fear is more severe than fear: because it is the highest mentioned in the attributes of the angels who are counted with the agreement that is the most fearful, and he said: They are from the fear of the Lord of the Lord: [27] In fear and fear is a famous.The second question: This is the verse, if it is an other verse to it, the group becomes a sign of the grace of knowledge and scholars, and that is because it is the Almighty: He said: He is the one who is afraid of God.So this verse indicated that the scientist is the owner of the fear, and this is the verse, and it is his saying: That is for those who fear his Lord, it is indicated that the owner of the fear is the one who is the one And he is generated from the group of the two verses that paradise is the right of scholars.The third question: Some of them said: This verse indicates that the woman does not end up to a limit that becomes with him, believed that he knows that he is the family of paradise To him.And this gold is not strong; Because the prophet, peace be upon them, have learned that they are from the people of paradise, and they are with that of the most rough worshipers for God Almighty, as he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: God, and I fear you from him.May God bless our master Muhammad and his family and his companions.
