The researcher of the Quran, His Excellency: The conclusion of God for their hearts and their hearing, and on their sights, and for them a great torment, I know that it is the highest in the first place.In this verse, it was informed of the causes that they did not believe, and it is the seal, and the words are here falling into the books: (The first question): the seal of the brother of the brother.Because there is a disagreement in the thing by the confusion of the conclusion to it as a dead and covered, so that it is not connected to it or it is related to it, and the absence of the cover, if the cover is, if the cover is the cover of the cover.This construction is what is covered by something, such as nerves and turbine.The second question: People in this seal differed, but those who say that the actions of worshipers are created for God Almighty.He said: The seal is the creation of the disbelief in the hearts of the infidels, and among them is those who said: It is the creation of the preacher that if it is joined to the capacity, the group of power is with it, with the grace of the one, And it is reported that the one who is unbelievers is either as a power to leave it or not, then it is not appreciated by its leaving, the ability is on the disbelief, for the disbelief, for the disbelief, for the disbelief.The ability to infidelity requires the creation of the disbelief, and if it is destined to leave it, the ratio of that capacity was to the verb of disbelief and to leave it together, so that it is that it is that A source of verb, instead of the blessing, stands on a prestigious joining to it or does not stop, if he does not stop, then he did not fall from the place of the place.And its permanence requires the praise in the subject of the possible effect, and that requires the exile of the chants while it is referred, but if it stands on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who stops it To be from the action of God or from the act of the servant or not from the action of God, nor from the act of the servant, it is not permissible to be from the act of the servant, but it is necessary With the act of God and not by the act of the servant; Because it is necessary to researches something, not for influencing, and that is the saying of the obedience.She proven that the universe of the servant is a source of the appointed power that stops to join it as a favorite, which is the verb of God Almighty.So we say: If that is the most likely to that capacity, then it becomes the effect of the capacity in that effect, and it is obligatory, or is it, or the one, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, The first, but he said that it is not permissible to be a permitted because if it was permissible, it would be correct in the mind that the group of power will be made with that, with that of that, with that of the ritual, with the same.And the last one is dismantled about it, so let's be satisfied with that; Because everything that was permissible is not necessary from the imposition of its impact, so that the group is a veil that arranges for the effect, and the last is not the arrangement of the effect, so it is the arrangement of the effect.This arranges the effect on him either P-46 stands up to him, or does not stop, if you stop, the influence is that of the gathering with this, with this pod.We have imposed that this group is the one who is in the successor of this, and also, and the division will come back in this second group, so if you stand on the authority of the one who stands on the one It is referred, and if it does not stop, then it is a matter One of the two things about the other is a matter of time, so this is a saying by the most likely one who is likely to be likely to be impossible and is referred.It was proven that when the most prestigious is to be implemented that the breasts of that effect will be permissible, and as it is not an objectionable, and the wilderness is not.Surprisingly for the enemy, and it is referred, and if the virtues are prolonged, it is proven that it is likely to obtain the existence Surprisingly, and if you prove this, the saying of algebra is necessary; Because before the most likely, the verb was not forbidden, and after his obtaining it, it would be obligatory, and when you know this, this was the creation of the obligatory prayer Keep on the heart and prevented him from accepting faith; So he gave it to him when they were governed by them that they do not believe in the male of his mind, what is running the course of the reason for him; Because the knowledge of the cause is the knowledge of the knowledge, and the knowledge of the highest is complete unless it is beneficial from the knowledge of the cause, so this is the saying of the one who added.As for the disgraced, they said: It is not permissible to conduct this verse on the prohibition of faith, and they embarrassed in it with the wages that we have told them about the verse, and the first of them The disbelievers who said: “On their hearts are as a and cover that prevents them from faith and said our hearts are all over [the cow: 88], but the best of God is the one who is good Except a few [Al -Nasa: 155], and he said: So he presented more of them, so they do not hear and said our hearts in the place of what you call us to it [separated: 4, 5] and this is all of it They claimed that they are varied from faith, then they said: Rather, it is necessary to carry the seal and the fraud on other things, then they mentioned it in it: And leaving the wasting with the Lords of God, so that it became like a thousand and the kindness, the same as the state of those who prevented the thing from the thing and repelled it from it, and that is in it.A bond that does not see anything, as if with their ears and a cows until the remembrance is not saved, but that is added to God Almighty; Because this adjective is in its possibility and the power of its steadfastness, such as the ethnicity; This is why he said: Rather God has their disbelief, so they do not believe [Al -Nasa: 155], but they have been on their hearts.They are strengthened.[Table: 77].And the second: that it is sufficient in the good addition of the lowest reason, for the bond is the conclusion in the truth or the infidel, except that God is exalted when he was the one who is able to do so the reason.And the third of it: that when they exposed the mobilization and did not listen to the remembrance, and that was when God revenues the signs of the evidence to add to what they did so, so they did not, so do what they did, so they did not.Because his jurisdiction was agreed upon his reference, his evidence was upon them as his saying, the exalted in Surah, with the lights: so they increased them as a pretext for the authority of them: Atonement for their disbelief.And he pushed it: that they reached the infidelity until they did not remain a way to establish faith for them except by the priest and the abandon On the leaving of the provision and the abandonment of the dies, a notification that they are the ones who ended in the infidels so where they do not intend for it except by the unknown, and it is the end of the righteousness in the end of the way.Fifth: that this is a story because the disbelief they say to it, assaulting it from their saying: Our hearts are in what you call us and in our ears and from our ears and from our ears and from our ears and from our ears [Separate: 5] and his counterpart in the story and the accusation of his saying: (P-47) (those who disbelieved from the people of the writers and the partners were not dismay [The evidence: 1].They hear them that it is not listening to the truth as the man says to his friend: I want to be sealed with what he says so, that is, you will believe him, and he will be given to him, In the first verse that they do not believe, and he was told in this verse that he witnessed that and preserved it on them.Specialists from the disbelievers, so God Almighty did with them this khuma and the sake of the world, punishing them in the urgent, as he hurried to many of the disbelievers, and he said: You knew those who have been accustomed to you in the Sabbath, so we told them that they were a lying apest.The immoral people are desperate [Al -Maidah: 26] and the like of hurrying, urgent, for what God has known in it from the lesson to his worshipers, and the salvation of this It was done with the abundance of seals and the pride, except that if they become with that until they do not understand, they will be tied to them as a slave of it.God is the same as those who understand some of the mind as the one who is the righteous, and we are denying that God creates in the hearts of the disbelievers, and it is forbidden for them to prevent them from the understanding That is good for them, as they may go with their minds and blind their eyes, but they do not in this case.And eighth: It is permissible for God to make their hearts with their hearts and their sights of me however, without that it is a barrier between them and between the faith, but it is like that The human being in his heart and the hate in his eyes and the shed in his ears, so God will do all of them with them to hinder their breasts and inherit them, the distress and the distress, so the distress, then the distress, and the distress, so From faith, as he did the children of Israel, then they will be lost, and then this act is in some of the infidels, and that is a verse of the Prophet ﷺ and a sign of it as the righteous The people of Pharaoh until they were used from it, and this is all restricted by what God knows that he reconciled to worshipers.And the ninth of it: It is permissible to do this conclusion with them in the hereafter, as he has told that he blinds them, he said: And we will gather them on the day of the resurrection on the authority of God, and with the sake 97] And he said: And we gave the criminals to the day of Zaraqah [Taha: 102] and he said: Today we have seen on their mouths [Yass: 65] and he said: They have an exhalation in it and they are not in it.And I adore it: What he narrated about the Basr Al -Basri - and he is the choice of Abi Ali Al -Jubayi and the judge - that what is meant by that is a mark and a smile that makes it in the heart of the infidels, and he hears it The angels are that they are disbelievers, and that they never believe in, so it is not far from being in the hearts of the believers, a mark that knows the angels with the same As he said: Those have written in their hearts faith [the argument: 22] and then the angels love him and seek forgiveness for him, and it will be for the hearts of the unbelieving.The angels have a curse with God, and they will hate him and curse him, and the one in that mark is either a reconciliation that is attributed to the angels; Because when they knew that mark, as it is a fool with God, it became an alienation from the infidelity.Or to the cost, then if he knew that when he believes, then the people of the heavens have loved him, then that is desired to him in faith, and if he knows that when he is given to the disbeliever They hate him and cursed him, that has become a mobilization for him from the infidels.They said: The seal is in this sense, it is not forbidden; Because we can after the seal of the book to disassociate it and read it, and because the seal is in a house that is written on the forehead of the infidel that it is a disbeliever, then it is a disbeliever, then if it is a disbeliever, then if it is not.This infidel can remove that characteristic from his heart by bringing faith and leaving the infidels.They said: Rather, he specialized the heart and hearing That; Because the hearing evidence is only beneficial from the hearing, and the mental evidence is only beneficial from the side of the heart, and this is what they are in remembrance.(P-48) If it is said: They will be borne in the eyesight, too, in the sense of the mark?We said: No; Because we carried what was presented to the heavens and the mark, because the language of the language requires that, and there is no prohibition from it, so it must be proven.As for the oppression, it is the right of the cover from the sight, and it is known from the state of the disbelievers.In his eyesight in the chapter of guidance.This is the group of people's sayings in this position.* * * (The third question): The righteousness in the Qur’an is close to the meaning of the seal is: the printing, and the art is, and the tenderness on the heart, and the veil in the ears, and the fraud in the ears, The uniform in that is different, for the first section: a significant significance on the crops of these things.It was possible to understand it and in their ears and a cows [Al -Anam: 25] and printed their hearts [Al -Tawibah: 87], but God has broken them with their disbelief [155] They hear [separated: 4] to warn who was alive [Yass: 70] that you do not hear the death and do not hear the deaf supplication [Al -Rom: 52] The mother of the righteous: The disease [cows: 10].The second section: a significant significance is that it is not forbidden to be dead and what people prohibited them to believe [Al -Asra: 94] so whoever wants, let him believe and whoever wills, then he will be forgiven [29] Its expansion [Al -Baqara: 286] and what made you in religion from embarrassment [Hajj: 78] How do you disbelieve in God [Al -Baqarah: 28] Why do you wear the truth [71] Folded from these two divisions, and every section of them became a toughest of the sects, so the indicators of the hearing are the same for being from the two parties in the two parties, in the righteousness of the two parties.The mental evidence is the one who has previously referred to it, and in the sentence, this question is one of the great Islamic issues and most of them are the people and the most intense of the imam, The supporters were asked about the disbelief of the dismay in this question, so he said: No; Because they looked at him, then he was asked about the people of the Sunnah, so he said: No, because they were great, and the meaning is that both of the two parties are not required except to prove the majesty of God Their view was signed on the bone, and they said: It is not possible to be the found and there is no existence except for it, and the dispersed, and their looked at the rule, so they said: “Do not be able to do it.” The homosexuals, and I say: We are another secret, which is that the proof of God resorted to the saying with algebra, because the effectiveness if you did not stop the preacher It is possible that it is not likely, and it is the denial of the artists, and if it would stand for algebra.And the messes of the Messenger resort to the saying of ability.Rather, here is a secret, it is above all, which is that when we returned to the premium and the first mind, and we found that what is equal to the presence and the numbers is not the same as it The other is only for a prestigious, and this requires algebra, and we also find a physical separation between the optional movements and the deteriorating movements, and the reward of the past, and the reward of the And the urbanization of the affairs, the matter and the end, and that requires the goldenness of the dismay, as if this question was raised in the bike of the opposition, according to the knowledge of the science, and the reference Theory, according to the greatness of God, the Almighty, in view of His ability and wisdom, and according to the neutrality and impurity, and according to the evidence of the hearing Which we have explained and the secrets that we have revealed about the facts that made the question difficult and exaggerated and exalted.Good, the Lord of the two worlds.* * * (The loyal question): The owner of the scout said: The memorizer should be able to be the reputation within the ruling of the seal, and in the ruling of the deception, except that the first of the first is in the time of the first His Excellency said: He was sealed by his hearing and his heart, and made his visibility to be ravaged [Al -Jatheya: 23], and they stopped them with their hearing without their hearts.(P-49) (The Fifth question): The one in the repetition of the neighbor in his saying: And on their hearing that it was when it was restored to the hearing, it was evidenced by the severity of the severity.(The sixth question): Rather, the hearts and the eyes were collected, and he heard the hearing of Wajah: one of them: that he limited the hearing; Because each one of them has one hearing, as it is said: I came to me with the heads of the captains, the head of each one means that one of them, as it limits the stomach in the saying of it: You live, “Do that if they believe in confusion, so if it is not believed as your saying: their horse and their hearts, and you want the collection, reject it.The second: that the hearing is a source in its origin, and the sources are not collected, it is said: the man is fasting, and the men of fasting, the righteous of the origin, indicates that it is in this And a cows [semester: 5].The third: to be appreciated by adding omitted, i.E., and on their hearing.Al -Rabaa: Sibuyeh said: He united the hearing, except that he mentioned what he accepted and after him with the memorization It brings them out of darkness to the light [Al -Maaidah: 16] on the authority of Yumin and on the north [Al -Ma’agh: 37] The shepherd said: ؎ The virginity of al -Hasiri, so its bones ∗∗∗ are white and the one Jalaoud, and the son of Abi Abla read [and on their hearing].* * * (The Sehop's question): One of the people who said: Hearing is better than insight; because God Almighty, where they mentioned the hearing against the eyesight, and the consequence is indicative of the impact, and because the hearing is the condition of the prophecy, with the disagreement of the insight.And they were in them who were wrapped in blindness, and because with the hearing, the grooves of one of the people will reach one, so the hearing is as if it is a reason for the mind of the mind, and the mind is not.Only on the senses, and because the hearing is short in the six bodies, with the difference of sight, and because the hearing is the same as the hero of the hero, and the insight is not.And among them is those who came in sight; Because the machine of the missionary power is honored, and because the attachment of the visionary power is the light, and the attachment of the poisonous power is the wind.The eighth question: His saying: God has seen their hearts indicating that the place of science is the heart.And we were excluded in his saying in his saying: The faithful spirit descended upon him on your heart [Al -Sha'arra: 193] in Surah Al -Shua’ar.(The ninth question): The owner of the scout said: Basic is the light of the eye, which is what the seren seeks and realizes the visions, as the vision is the light of the heart, which is the light of the heart, which is the light of the heart.And he hoped, as if they were a good man who created God Almighty in them, the two homes for the eyes and the sins.And investigating the saying in the vision, it calls for a visible research that does not fit this position.(Al -Masal Al -Ashira): Reading (Buddha) with fractures and monuments, and guaranteeing the guarantee and raising, and the oppression of openness and the monument, and the fraction of the fracture, and the fraction, and the fraction, and the fraction, And raising and stabbing, and randomness with the eyes other than the domination and the lifting of the nest, and the mereness is the cover, and it is the freshest, and it is deceived by it if it remains the mind of the mind The intercourse.(The sharp question is ten): The torment is the same as a meal and meaning; Because you say that he is tormented about something if he holds it from it, as you say that we eat from it, and from it the torment, because it is the thirst of the thirst, and he will be deceived, so he will be unjust.They are called him as a patch, because he is the thirst, that is, he broken it, and it is because it is driving it from the heart, then it expands in it.A torment, even if it is not a punishment for the perpetrator, and the difference is between the great great: that the great is the opposite of the despicable, and the oldest, the oldest, and the old The great is on the authority of the oldest, as the despicable is without the young, and they are used in the bodies and events all, saying: a great and great man who wants his body, or his lap The denial that their eyesight is a type of coverage, other than what the people caters, and it is the cover of the column of the verses of God, and among them among the great pain is a great kind of people who do not know Come here.* * * (The second question is ten): Agree The Muslims are good that he is better than God, the torment of the infidels, and some of them said: He does not improve and explain his saying: And they have a great torment: [7] But his generosity is obliged to pardon, and let us remember the two parties, but those who do not perish to empty Impressive is a harmful harm to the benefits of the benefit, so it is necessary to be ugly.Because that is the one who is the one who is the one who is high, or to God, or to others, and the first is invalid; Because it is a concept of benefit and the harm, with the difference of one of us in the witness, then if he worshiped him, if he offends him, he will be able to.Because he dedicates that discipline because he was in his heart of the love of reverence; Because if he sustains it, he is removing after that, what is harmful to him.The second is also false; Because that is the benefit either that you are domesticated to the torment or to others, but to the torment, it is referred; Because the harm does not be the eye of the integrity, and as for it, it is a matter; Because the payment of the circle is pronounced by the pursuit of the delivery of the benefit, so the delivery of the circle to a person to the supplication of the benefit to another person is a prejudice to the righteous, and it is a pleasure, and he is a pleasure for the righteous, and he is a pleasure There is no benefit, God wants to communicate to one, except that he is able to communicate with that, unanimously, the harm is not possible.Impressive is a harm free from all the benefits and that it is the knowledge of the ugliness of the mind of the mind, but its ugliness is evident in the minds of the dumbness Which is not harmful, but rather the dumb false and harmful ignorance; Because that harmful falsehood is and a means to the harm, and the ugliness of what is a means to the circle without the ugly of the soul of the circle, and if his ugliness is proven, he will be forbidden from the rituals of God; Because it is wise and the wise does not do the cubic.And the second: that he was the highest of the infidels that the infidel is not believed in what he said: Those who disbelieved were both to them.The disbeliever only appeared from it, and if that disobedience was a reason for the punishment, that is to be hurry to the punishment of the punishment.Because it is the form of the cause, and on the sentence, then that is a matter of time when he obtained his obstacle, not the case of the punishment, and it was not a follower of the light of the eminence, and it was not the It is obligatory to be a tribute, and the dignity is not done by the wise, and there is no one left except for one of the two things, either that it is not said that this is not the same The punishment is followed, and how it was, so the intended is.And the third of it: It is an either that it is said: The creation of creation is for the rush, or for the harm, or not for the benefit or the harm, for if they created them for the benefit, he must not cost them what he leads to against it He was like that, and when they knew their feet on the disobedience, if they were to know them, the cost was a verb that leads them to punishment, then if it is a baking of their effect, they do not have to do so that they do not.And where he wrapped them, indicated that the disobedience is not a reason for the achievement of torment, and it is not permissible to say: they created them, not to al-Ta`fa (P-51) or to harm; Because the blessing is sufficient in that; Because it is in this estimation, it is vast, and it is not permissible to say: created them for harm; Because the example of this is not a generous merciful, and the minds and the partnership have been preserved on his universe as a generous merciful, and that the blessings of the Lord, and the blessing On the nickname of punishment.And its elevation: that it is the creator of the creators that require sins, so he will be the refuge to it, so he will be punished for being punished for them, but he said that he is the creator, for the custodian of the The verb of the verb from the estimation that stops the renovation of the preachers that God Almighty creates, and showed us that that is required of the mighty, and it is forbidden, Perhaps they decided this from another face, and they said: If the saints and the Shariah are the two people, then they came to two people from the people, then they accepted them, and the other is the opposite of the other The other, if it was said, why did he accept this and violate the other?And it is said: Because he loved the reward and warned the punishment, and he obeyed, and the other did not love and did not warn, and he will be blessed, or that this listened to those who preached and understood it, and he did not do it, and he did not.And he did not understand, and he said, and it is said: Why did he listen and do not understand that, and he did not listen to that, and he did not understand?So we say: Because this is a firm, pent, and this is the most ignorant, stupid, and it is said: Why was this sealed with the belief and the mutan without that?There is no doubt that the country and the country are from the strange conditions, because the human being does not choose the stupidity and the burning and does not do them in itself, so if the explanation is made to it, the explanation is to the things that create it.We have to know that all of these things are in the judiciary of God, and you can not settle among the two characters who obeyed one of them and disobeyed the other in the case of the other in the case of the other in the case.The cancer, the dustling, the belief and the burning, the teachers, the scholars, and the Zajarin, and you cannot say that if they are equal in all of that, all of it is not in all of that The reason for obedience and disobedience is one of the people who are forth in the creation of God Almighty and his judgment, and when this is said: Where is justice, the mercy, and the generosity of the good From rudeness and bridge, stupidity and cruelty, and the fragrance and the burning, then he is punished for him?And he created it like what He created a firm, firm, disobedient, scientist, and where is the justice to heat his heart, strengthen his anger, and go to his brain, and he will not be more A disciplined manner, a scholar, a scholar, and a preacher, but rather to him, add to him the additions of these in their actions and their ethics, so he learns from them, then he takes what he takes.The firm, the sane, the righteous, the head, the bound of the mood of the heart, the gentle, the spirit, which he gave it as a lip, and a complete teacher?What is this of justice, mercy, generosity and raft in something!So that he said that the saying of the punishment of the minds of the minds.Fifth: It is up to us, but we have made us alienated to us; Because he said: If you do well, you will be well for yourself, and if you have asked, then [Al -Asra: 7] If we disobey, then he will fulfill us on the same one.The wise takes a human being and says to him: I torment you with hard torment; Because you have fulfilled the same benefits, then it is said to him: If you get the benefit, it is a lineage with the proportion of the fulle The one who is overlooked for me for the sake of that is its great And to benefit from it, especially for me to have the greed of the bit, and when this dinar did not gain, and you did not benefit from it, and I will take it, and I will take it, and I will take it.That this is the end of the fooling, so how can the rule of the rulers?!Then they said: Give us this punishment.That is because the hardest people are a heart and the most intense of them, angry, angry, and a distance from the best if he takes those who are in the abuse to him and tortured him on one day, a month, or a month, or a year, for a year, for him, He remained persistent for him to every one, and it is said (P-52) He endowed that this was in your light, but when this is the torture?Either you kill him and rest him, or to save him, then if this is a person who is a person who is governed by standardization, then the rich of all of this is what he says?.And the sixth of it: that he was granted by his worshipers from the exploitation of the increase, so he said: He does not seek to kill the killing that he was a victim [Al -Asra: 33] and he said: And a bad reward [40] Then, the servant came to God who disobeyed the height of his life, so whose age is from forever?It will be the oppressive punishment.And he pursued it: The servant, even if he had the same as his age, then if he repented, then he died, may God forgive him and answered his supplication and accepted his repentance, do not you see that this is the one who does not Or the minds of those who are tormented, they did not remain, and why they do not repent of their transgression?And if they repent, why will God be accepted Their repentance, and why he does not hear their call, and why does their hope disappoint?And if it was in the world in the mercy and the generosity, where he said: Call me, I will respond to you [Ghaffir: 60] To him is more severe, because he does not address them except by saying: They are fascinated by it and do not speak [the believers: 108] they said: So this is what is required of what is necessary for the sake Among these in the Qur’an: The excuse is what is mentioned in the Qur’an from the types of torment from the faces: one of them: that the conjugation of the righteous signs does not benefit the murdered, Al -Yakin, and the two guards do not oppose the cutting, but we said: The indicative indications do not benefit the juvenile, because the indicative indicators are based on all of them.And the building on the suspicion is my thought, but rather it is a building on the basis of thought; Because it is a building on the transfer of languages ​​and the transfer of grammar and the script, and the narrators of these things are not known to their manifestation to the limit A building on the numbers of the consent, the vastness of the metaphor, the number of specialization, the number of guests with leadership, the two decreases, the number of progress and the last, and all of that A building on the nursing of the mental assignments, for it is the ability of its existence and its presence cannot be said by their sincerity, nor by their lies, and it is not possible, and it is not possible.Because the mind is the origin of the transmission, and the stabbing in the mind requires stabbing in the mind and the transfer with it, but the mind of the mind is the mind, then this is not, so if this is not, then this is not.We found a mental state on the dispute of this distress, and it was proven that the significance of this significant indicative is a thought, but that the oppression does not In it.And the second: which is that the rivalry of the return is improved in what is among the people, the poet said: ؎ If I promised him or promised him to the successor of my dads, and I will be prepared, but I am the one You will be fulfilled as if it is a promise, and if it is also, it is not necessary to reconcile from God Almighty, and this is based on a letter, which is that the people of the Sunnah are the same.The compliance, and their letters in which the matter is enacted by a ruling that arises from the same thing For his servant, he will do the action tomorrow, and if he knew immediately that he will be forbidden from him tomorrow, and he will be intended for that matter to show the servant of the servant That is the same as his obedience, so if God knows that he will die tomorrow, then he will be improved by the people of the Sunnah, and he does not say: The intended of this matter will be the matter With it; Because it is a referral, but the intended is a ruling that arises from the same matter.It is permissible for the news to be said also?A stronger will be the origin of wisdom from the news, which is the one who is informed about it and that is in the promise, and a time is the origin of the rule, it is the same as the news, not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the news, and not The news is on the way of the feast, which benefits the dirt from the ticks and the feet of obedience, then if this is the reason, it is permissible that the expert is not found in it, and the expert is not in it, and the expert is as it is in it, and the expert is not in it.And God has prepared the reward for a right, and it is a punishment for the punishment, but it is necessary for it, but it was intended for the goodness of the costs with the merciful, as well as the mercy of the By killing, poisoning, cutting, and stirring, then if the child accepted his command, he has risen, and if he did not do, then in the heart of the father from the companionship, he will be killed by the father.If it is said that all of the ventures will be a liar and a liar is a rug.So, then, if we greeted us, but we do not surrender that it is a lie, is not that all the generalities of the Qur’an are special and not called a liar, who is not a liab Its grooves, and this is not called a lie, so we are here.And the third of it: is not that the verses of the return in the right of the disobedience are a journey in the vastness of the repentance, and if this condition is not mentioned in the sacrifice of the text, then it is also with us Pardon, even if this condition is reminded of a slight text, or we say: it is meaning that the disobedient deserves these types of punishment, so that he is the one who is punished by The news about the investigations of the fall, so this is the sentence of what is said in the report of this gold, and the people who have proven to the suffering of the torment, so they said that we will say to us God ﷺ The fall of the torment, and its denials will be a lie to the Messenger, and the similarity that you have touched in the denial of punishment is a building on the one We say with him and God knows.
