Because the cure of lending does not fall on the kinship of the language, then he said: It is not possible to carry this saying on health, except that we say: the poor is the one who does not His heart was that if he was able to spend and give it, then that the intention will be the extent of the extent of spending, and it was narrated from it ﷺ that he said: He believes in him, so let him go away, for he has a charity.* * * The second question: they disagreed that the launch of the loan on this spending is a right or a metaphor.To him, the Arabs say: You have a good and bad loans, and what is meant by the verb that is rewarded for him, said Amy ibn Abi Al -Salat: Good, bad, or debt To cut off their impact, then if it is bound, what is meant is cut to him from his money or his work is a piece that is rewarded for it.And the second saying: that the preservation of the loan is a metaphor, and that is because the loan is that the human being gives something to return to it like it, and it is the one who is in the man To return to him with his replacement, except that he made the conflict between this spending and between the loans from his face Reasonable exaltation.And the second: that the substance in the accustomed loan is only the example, and in this spending is weak.And the third of it: that the money that the stable takes is not the king of it, and here is this money that is taken by the king of God, then with the arrival of this, the rituals of God And the ruling is in which the alert is that it is not lost in God, so that the loan must perform its performance, and the goodness is not permissible for it, so the reward for this is not required to do so A referral, and it is narrated that when this verse has come down, the Jews said: God is a poor and we are rich, so he asks for the loan, and this is the word, and this words are not.Because the majority of them are similar to them, and they say: their servants are Sheikh, the judge said: Whoever says in his idols is the same as this saying that he does not say that he does not.If it was said: What is the meaning of the Almighty saying: Who is the one who lends to God a good loan and for any extensive, the words are seen on the way of the question?(P-143) We said: That is in the desire to pray to the verb, close to the appearance of the matter.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: A good loan, and it has two questions: The first question: The one said: The second question: as the time of the loan is good, it is enticed by its faces: [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
