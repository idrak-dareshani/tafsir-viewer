The researcher is the Almighty: He who created the death and life in it: the first question: they said: Life is the adjective that will be described as the one who knows that it is true, And they differed in the death, and a people said: It is a light of the numbers of this characteristic, and our companions said: It is a row and a counter -antagonist for life, and they are the one who said: He said: He who created death and numbers is not a creature, this is the verification, and the dog narrated with his chain of chain He passes something, and his smell does not find anything unless he dies, and the life is created in a virgin image that he throws on the authority of the perfection and without the boil, and it does not pass something and does not find anything.And know that this is inevitable and that it is saying on the path of representation and confusion, otherwise the verification is the one who mentioned it.The second question: but the remembrance of the death is presented to the remembrance of life with the fact that life is presented to the death of a woman: one of them: a fighter said: He means the death of me Chew and life is the breath of the soul.And the second: A giving was narrated from Ibn Abbas, who said: P-49 wants to die in the world, and life in the hereafter is the home of the animal.And the third of it: that it was narrated from the Prophet ﷺ: “A call to call the Day of Resurrection: O people of Paradise, and they know that it is before God, may God bless you, and say: He says: Did you find what your Lord really promised?They said: Yes, then the death is brought in a picture of salt and slaughtered, then calls: O people of Heaven, immortalism without death, and the people of the fire, without the absence Farah to joy, and the people of the fire are grieved to sorrow.And know that we have indicated that the death is a symptom, such as the silence and the movement, so it is not permissible for him to become a ram, but what is meant by the representative is to know that in this day, the day is in that day The death, it appeared in what we mentioned that the days of the death are the days of the world and they are contradictory, and the days of the hereafter are the days of life and they are late; When the days of death were stated on the days of life, there is no crime, God has mentioned the remembrance of the death on the remembrance of life.And the one who was subjected to it: the death came to life; Because the most powerful people calling for work whoever sets his death between his eyes, he presented that he was returning to the extent of his wise.The third question: Know that life is the origin in the blessing, and if it was not a single in the world, it is also the original in the last blessings of the last, and if only the reward, the reward is not.Also, a blessing on what we have explained in the positions of this book, and how is it not, which is the factor between the state It is the remembrance of this self.This is the same, for your concern for what I see.They said: Few, he said: It is not as you say.* * His Excellency said: Let it be blessed, which is the best deed, and it is the dear, the Forgiving, and it has questions: He disobeyed, and that is in the right of those who must be a scholar of all information, eternal and referred to, except that we have fulfilled this question in the interpretation of the one who said: His Lord with the words (Al -Qarra: 124), which is the one that the abuse of God is that his servant is treated with a transaction that resembles (the latter) on the lab.The second question: The people who say that he did the verb doing the verb to the sake of his saying: (Let you be blessed) said: This is the mother of the sake of the sake of the sake Let them worship (the aircraft: 56), and his answer is that the verb in itself is not in the midst of it, except that it is when it is like the sacrifice, it is permissible.It is in itself, so he mentioned the sacrifice.The third question: Know that I am pleased with death and life with death as if he was softened, stuck and chewed, and life after that.So he went on the way to know that he is the one who transferred him from death to life, and as he did so, then it is necessary and that he is a person who has been able to do it.So the coming of the death, which he cuts, warns of what you missed, and it is equal to the poor, the rich, the mourning, and the servant.The latter is in them.Because fear is from death in the world, and it is more severe than it is the fear of life in the resurrection, and it is intended from the abuse that it is the abandonment of the dome with this?(P-50) The loyal question: In the comment of his saying: (Let you be blessed) with his saying: Which of you is the most good deed and ahead: Advanced, and appreciation: to let you know, and he will know, and look at any of you, the best work.The fifth question: I benefited (i.E.) by calling, and it does not work in it before it; Because it is at the origin of the question, then if you say: I do not know which is the best of the meaning, I do not know more than the best of Umar.And know that what does not work as after a thousand, so does not work in (any); Because the meaning is one, and the counterpart of this verse is its saying: they asked them, whichever is a leader (the pen: 40) and the words were presented in it.The sixth question: Remember the interpretation of the best deeds of faces: one of them: to be the sake of the best and worse.Because the work, if it is pure, is not right, it is not accepted, and so if it is right, it is not pure, then the good is to be the face of God, It is correct to be over the Sunnah.And the second: Qatada said: “I asked the Messenger of God ﷺ and he said:“ He says: “Which of you is better than a mind.” Then he said: I hope you have a mind that is more severe for God Looking, "Rather, it is permissible to explain the good deed with the completion of the mind; Because he arranges the mind, whoever was a mind was better than a deed on what was mentioned in the hadith of Qatada.And the third of it: narrated from Al -Hasan: Which of you is a minor in the world and the most heavily left of it, and know that when he mentioned the hadith of the lords, he said after him: He is the dear Who is not miraculously for those who offended the work, the Forgiving of those who repented from the people of the misfortune.He knew that his being is dear, forgiven, and only after his being led by all the destinations, a world of all information, but that it is necessary for the destiny, for the destiny, for the destiny, It can be able to deliver the reward of every one with his fullness to him, whether it was punishment or reward, and as for it is necessary from the full knowledge, so it is not that he knows that he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who knows who is The error in communicating the right to its eligibility, and it has proven that its unilateral, forgiven, cannot be proven only after the evidence of the complete ability and the knowledge of the fullness, the fullness and the knowledge of the fullness, the fullness and the knowledge of this.God is evidence of the evidence of these two classes in this place, and when the knowledge was in its formation, the exalted be able to be able to know about the knowledge of it, not a scholar, not a scholar.Secondly, the science of science.
