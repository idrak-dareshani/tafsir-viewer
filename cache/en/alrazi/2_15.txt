The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of the exalted: If they met those who believed, they said: We believed in us, and if they gave them to their thieves, they said that we are with you, but we are mocked by God Their tyrants do this, this is the one who is the fourth of their verb, the dignity, it is said: I met him and met him if you receive him as a relative of him, and he reads the father His saying: They said: We are safe, so what is meant is our hearts with the heart, and the evidence is upon him and Jahan: The first: that the establishment of the tongue was known to them, so what they needed to do so In it is the salvation of the heart, so they must be their intention of this speech.The second: that their saying to the believers “believed us” must carry on the elaboration of what they appeared to show them to their thief That their intended as they mentioned it to the believers (P-63) believing in the heart, but he said it: and if they were given to their shirts, then the owner said: “ And to him, if you repel it with it, and it is permissible to be of “a” sense in a sense that goes on, and from it the empty centuries, and from “I have passed it with it” if you are ridiculed from it, from it, then: That is, it is tired of it, and it is meaning that they ended the mockery of the believers to their demons and talked to them with it as you say: I will be exalted to you and let him down.As for their demons, they are those who have gathered the demons in their repetition, but his saying: We are with you, so they have two questions: the first question: this is the most important of all.Answer: This is a dispute; Because whoever carries the demons on the great hypocrites, he carries this saying that he is one of their young people and they were saying to the believers, and if they come back to you, they are back to you.Like they do not dearely to them, and whoever says in the devils: What is meant by the disbelievers is not forbidden to add this saying to all the hypocrites, nor the arrivals, nor the suspects, nor the distress They are their old people, and they are either the infidels or the people of the hypocrites; Because they are those who appreciate corruption in the land, and their juniors are no.The second question: Why did they address the believers in the actual sentence, and their thighs in the religious sentence achieved by “that”?The answer: The believers are not serious about the strongest words; Because they were in claiming the resurrection of faith from them, not in claiming that they are in the full constellation of it, either because themselves do not assist them in the form; Because the saying is about hypocrisy and hatred, it is not with the exaggeration, or for their knowledge that the claim of the fullness in faith does not promote the Muslim, and the words of the Muslim, They used to say it about the belief, and they knew that those who were satisfied with that of them were accepted, so the assertion was not in accordance with it.As for his saying: We are mocked, so they have two questions, The first question: What is the mockery?Answer: The origin of the light door is from mock, which is the fast enemy, and he died died of his place, and his purpose is mocking him, that is, it will be exhausted, and he will be exhausted, The one who runs the course of badness on the way of harnessing, so this is their saying: We are mock We stand on their secrets, and take from their charity and their singing.The second question: How do you say his saying: We are mocked by his saying: We are with you?Answer: It is a certainty for him; Because his saying: We are with you with the steadfastness of the disbelief and its saying: We are mockery of a response to Islam, and the response of the oppression of the thing, or the affliction From it; Because whoever has gone into Islam has lost the disbelievers, or is nurtured as if they were subjected to him when they said: We are with you, so they said if it is true, then what is it?They said: We are mocked.And know that he was groaning and exalted when he told them, he answered them with things.One of it: His saying: God is mocking them with questions.The first question: How can God describe the Almighty that he is mocking and has proven that the mockery does not disregard for the dress, and it is referred to God; Because he does not break from ignorance, because he said: “Do you take us shake.And the answer: They mentioned in the interpretation of five aspects: one of them: that what God does with them is a reward for their mockery of his name with a mockery; Because the part of the thing is called in the name of that (P-64), the Almighty said: A bad, bad, like [Al-Shura: 40], so whoever is accustomed to you, so that they can do not.On you [Al -Baqarah: 194] they deceive God while he deceived them [the women: 144], and they are deceived and the deception of God [Al -Amran: 54] and peace be upon him: With a poet, he gave it to him, God, and what is the number of what is my body.And the second: that the harm of their mockery of the believers is a return to them and others harmful to the believers, and it will become as if God has mocked them.And the third of it: One of the effects of jewelry is the fact that the humiliation and the conversation are mentioned, so he mentioned the mockery, and the intention is to obtain the humiliation of them, expressing the causes of the cause.And its elevation: that the mockery of God with them to appear to them from his rulings in the world, what they have for God, their disagreement in the hereafter, as they showed that they have appeared in The secret is its disagreement, and this interpretation is weak; Because it is up to them when the rulings of the world appeared to them, and the clear evidence of what they deal with in it appeared in The other house is a bad and great punishment, so there is no violation of what it appears in the world.Fifthly: that God Almighty treats them with the transgression of mockery in the world and in the hereafter, but in the world, it is because he is upset with the Messenger on their secrets, with them, and they were in their lords, with their lords, with them.As for the hereafter, Ibn Abbas said: If the believers enter Paradise, and the infidels are the fire, then God opened a chapter on heaven in the hell in the place that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the opponent who is The hypocrites saw the chapter, a dead man, who took out of hell and turned to paradise, and the people of paradise look at them, so if they come to the garden, then they will come to the chapter.Without them, the door, and that is the saying of the Almighty: Those who were chosen were among those who believed in laughing at his saying: So the day of those who believe in the infidels are laughing [Al -Mutafifin: 34] This is the jewelry of them.The second question: How did he start saying: God is mocked by them, and he did not overcome the words before him?.Answer: It is an exile in the end of the earthquake and the luxury, and in which God is exalted is the one who is mocking the great mockery of the greatness That God is the one who undertakes the mockery of them as a revenge for the believers, and the believers are not crowned until they oppose them with a similar mockery.The third question: Is it said: God is mocked by them to be a custody of his saying: We are mocked?Answer: Because “mocking” is beneficial to the jokes of the mockery and renewed it after time, and this was the absences of God in them: First, they will see that they are in a year.Two two times [the repentance: 126] and also what they were free in the most of their duties from your cheeks, and the revelation of the righteousness, and the sensing of a warning that you will come down to them.Excellents to be revealed to them a surah that predicts them in their hearts, say, they are mocked, God is a way that you warn.The second answer: His Excellency said: It extends them in their tyrants, they are blind [Al -Baqara: 15] The owner of the scout said: It is from the extension of the army and his life, and it is more Likewise, the extension of the medicine and its supply increased it, which reconciles it, and I extended the lamp and the land if they were reconciled with the etching and the Samad, and the two devils are in the absence, and it will be fulfilled, and it will be done with it, One.And some of them said: A tide is used in evil, and he has been extended in goodness.And the threshold, and this is a mistake for Jahin: The first: that (P-65) is the reader of Ibn Katheer, and Ibn Muhaisn “and their development” and the luxury of a fool (and their brothers in the absence) It is one of the deeds without The tide.The second: that the one who is in the sense of his nation is only for him, as I hope for him, the dismissed said: This verse cannot be done on it, it is not possible for it to say: And their brothers provide them with the absence, adding that absence to their brothers, so how to be added to God Almighty?.And the second: that God Almighty has forgiven them on this tyrant, and if it was a verb for God Almighty, how is they vilifying them?.And the third of it: If it was a verb, the transgression of the nobility of the prophecy and the hero of the Qur’an, then the preoccupation with its interpretation was in vain.And he pushed it: that he has added the tyrants to them with his saying: “In their tyrants,” and if he was from that of God, he would not have added to them, so he appeared to him, so he will be over.The exalted is not a virtuous for that, and its credibility is that when the tide was supported to the demons, he released the absence and did not restrict it to the addition in his saying: and their brothers are in the absence: This is proven, so we say: Tawil from his faces: one of them: It is the interpretation of Al -Kaabi and my father, Muslim, Bin Yahya Al -Asfah The believers and let them down in the causes of their disbelief and their renovation, and their hearts remained grievance in the balance of darkness in it and the existence of the light in the heart Al -Tawadid is a dedication and supported it to God Almighty; Because it is caused by his action with them.And the second: that it is carried on the prevention of the provision and the abandonment as it was said: The shed, if it is not forbidden, is a matter.And the third of it: to support the act of Satan to God Almighty; Because he can be able, his estimation, and abstraction between him and between the seduction of his worshipers.And he was upset: What Al -Jubayi said, then he said and extends them, that is, extend their life, then they are with that in their tyrants, they are blind, and this is weak from the one who is the one who is the first: Explanation and extend them with the extension of life.The second: He endowed that it is correct for that, but it benefits that it is an exalted life that extends their life to the abuse that they are in their tyrants, and that is the benefit.The judge answered that it is not what is meant that he is the exalted of their life to be present to be in the tyrants, but what is meant is that he will remain in them and he will be in the way of the good.To be blind.And know that the words in this section were presented in his saying: God has sealed their hearts, so there is no use in the return.He knew that the tyrant is the glory in the infidels and the purpose of the limit in the Atto, he said: “When the water was overwhelmed [Al -Haqiyah: 11] that is, his destiny, and he said:“ He went to the Farah ” I see the limit.Zaid ibn Ali (in their tyrants) read the fracture and they are two linguistics and a luminous, and his uncle is like a blind man, except that the blindness is general in the eyesight and the opinion, and the opinion is in the opinion Hesitation and confusion does not know what to go.
