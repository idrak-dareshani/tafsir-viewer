The researcher of the Quran, his highness: A lot of the people of the book, if they would return you after your faith, disbelievers, envy from themselves, after them Until God comes with his command that God is able to be able to know that this is the third type (P-214) Azura.The truth is what you have been defeated.They said: Shadid.In Islam, a religion, in the Qur’an, an imam, and the kaaba before, and with the believers as a brothers, then the Messenger of God ﷺ came and told him, so he said: This is the verse, and I know that we speak first in the envy and then go back to interpretation.The first question: in the vilification of the envy, and many news is indicated by him: the first: His saying is upon him, peace be upon him: The second: Anas said: “We were a day sitting at the Prophet ﷺ and he said: He is now up to you from this fog, a man from the people of Paradise, so he broke up from the man from the man of the man from the man.From his lights, and he commented on his north, and he was a peace, and when tomorrow, peace be upon him, like that, like that, so that the man said, and he said in the ritual, and he said in the righteousness, So that the man came up, and when the Prophet, peace be upon him, rose to him, Abdullah bin Amr ibn Al -Aas said, and he said: I hurt me from my father, so I will be divided, and I will not be divided.If you go to your house, you did, he said: Yes, and he has three nights, so he did not see him, he will rise from the night, something that if he turned over, then he will be over.He rises to the prayer of the dawn, other than that I did not hear it, he said only good, so when I passed the three, and I could have been able to do his work, I said: O servant of God, and for me Anger and no abandonment, but I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ he said such and such, so I wanted to know your work, and I did not see you doing a lot of work, so what is the one?He said: It is nothing but what you saw.When I was invited, he said: What is only what I saw is that I did not find any of the Muslims in myself a defect and no envy of the best that God has given him, and God said: She reached you, which is unbearable.The third: peace be upon him said: ““ Do you have the disease of the nations before you.Poetry, but the condition of religion.Al -Rabaa: He said: “It will afflict my nation the disease of the nations, they said: What is the disease of the nations?He said: The evil, the heroes, the multiplication, the competition in the world, the expansion, and the enlightenment until the prostitute will be then the way.Fifth: that Moses, peace be upon him, when he went to his Lord, he saw in the shadow of the throne as a man who is confused with his place, and he said: This is a generous of his Lord, and he asks for his Lord, and he asks for his Lord He did not tell him about his name, and he said: I spoke to you from his work three: He was not envying people about what God has given them from his grace, and he did not obey and do not.The sixth: peace be upon him said: “For God blessing is a larger, it was said: What are you?He said: Those who envy people on what God has given them from his grace.The swallow: peace be upon him: “Six enter the fire before the account: the princes with the neighbor, and the Arabs with the nerve, and the arrogance with the arrogance, and the abundance, and the ritual With ignorance, and the scholars with envy.As for the effects: the first: it was narrated that Aff ibn Abdullah entered the best of the son And the arrogance, for it is the first sin that God has disobeyed him, and then he read: And when we said to the angels, they would find the Adam, and they would find, except for my father, and the righteous.It was brought out by Adam from paradise; أسْكَنَهُ اللَّهُ في جَنَّةٍ عَرْضُها السَّماواتُ والأرْضُ فَأكَلَ مِنها, فَأخْرَجَهُ اللَّهُ, ثُمَّ قَرَأ: اهْبِطا مِنها [طه: 123] وإيّاكَ والحَسَدَ; He killed the son of Adam, his brother, when his envy, then read: And the Prophet of the son of Adam came upon them with the truth [Al -Ma’idah: 27].The second: (P-215) Ibn al-Zubayr said: I did not envy anyone over the matter of the world; Because if he is one of the people of Paradise, then how is it the best of the world while it is a wise in paradise, and if it is one of the people of the fire, it is how it enlightens it on the matter of the world.The third: A man said to the good: Does the believer envy?He said: He did not forget the children of Yaqoub, except that he does not harm you from what you did not prepare for a hand and a tongue.The lord: Muawiyah said: All people are able to satisfy him except the envious; It is only satisfied by the disappearance of grace.Fifth: It was said: Al -Hasid does not get from the sitting except a humiliation and humiliation, and he does not obtain from the angels except for a curse and hatred, and he does not get from creation except for the reward and the dignity of the Stroke, and when the stand is only a clear and a meal.* * * And the competitor, the first is forbidden in every case, except for a blessing that has been afflicted or disbelievers who seek help from evil and corruption, so you do not harm your love for its weight; You do not love Its demise from where it is a blessing, but from where it is clinging to corruption, evil and harm.And that indicates that the envy is what we mentioned verses: one of them: this is the verse, and it is the saying of the Almighty: if they would return you after your faith, the disbelievers of the goodness of the people of the people Their love is the demise of the grace of faith.And the second: His Excellency said: Will, if you disbelieve, as they disbelieve, then you will be both [Women: 89].And the third of it: His Excellency said: If you are touched by goodness, they will be misfortune, and if you become bad, they will rejoice in it [Al -Imran: 120] and this joy is tattoo, and the grace and the tattoos.And its elevation: God mentioned the transgression of the envy of the brotherhood of Joseph, and crossed the hearts of their hearts with his saying: They said to be desperate and his brother loved to our father from us and we are a nerve Kill Joseph or leave him a land that gives you the face of your father [Joseph: 9] So he explained that their envy of them is a expressive of their sequences.Fifth: His Excellency said: They do not find their chests a need from what they have given [Al -Hashr: 9] that is, they do not narrow them with their breasts and do not be overwhelmed, so God bless them.And its sixth: The Almighty said in the exposure of denial: Or do they envy people on what God has given them from his grace [Women: 54].And the sake of it: God Almighty said: People were one nation, so God sent the prophets [Al -Baqarah: 213] to his saying: Except those who have given him from what came to them after the sins of the sins of the sons.It was said in interpretation: envy.And the eighth: His Excellency said: And they were separated only after what science came to them in terms of them [Al -Shura: 14], so God has revealed to the knowledge of them, and they will be blessed, so they will be blessed, and they will be blessed, so they will be blessed, so they will be blessed, and they will be blessed.He wanted every one to be unique in the ritual and acceptance of the saying.And the ninth: Ibn Abbas said: You were at the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, if they fought a people, they said: We ask you for the Prophet, who is our authority, and we have come to us.It is revealed to us, but they would be victorious, so they were victorious, so when the Prophet, peace be upon him, came from the son of Asmail, they knew him and disbelieved him after he said: They are open to those who disbelieve [Al -Baqarah: 89] to his saying: that they disbelieve what God has descended in the absence [Al -Baqarah: 90], meaning envy.And the grace of the daughter of a neighborhood for the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: My father and my uncle came from you, and my father said to my uncle: What do you say about it?Peace, he said: So what do you see?As for the competitor, it is not forbidden, and it is derived from the breath, and which indicates that it is not with a wasting, and it is: the first: the saying of it: [Motivin: 26].And the second: His Excellency said: Prepare to forgiveness from your Lord, but the stallion is when the fear They belong to the servant of their birth, as each one is seen by its owner, and he has a house with a house that he does not have.And the third of it: peace be upon him: “There is no envy except in two: a man who came to him (P-216) God is money, so he will spend it in the path of God, and a man who has come to God People teach him.This hadith indicates that the observation may be called the competitors, then we say: the competitor may be a duty, the denominator, and the permissible, and it is permissible, but it is obligatory.The grace is a religious grace and a duty, such as faith, prayer and zakat, for it is obligatory for him to have an example of that; Because if he does not like that, he is satisfied with disobedience, and that is forbidden, and if that of that grace is from the depositary, such as spending in the path of God, and the ritual of God The competition in it is a delegate, but if that grace is permissible, the competitors were in it from the permissible, and in the course, then the slander is that it is loved, so that it will be loved, so that it will love the disappearance, so that it will be forced.Its collection of it, and the demise of the deficiency of it, for this is not defamatory, but it is a minute, which is that the disappearance of the decrease from it is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same: He has the same as what he got for others.And the second: that he goes away from others, he did not get it, so if he gets the despair of one of the two ways, then the heart is almost unable Whereas, if he was able to remove that guest from that person to remove her, then she is the owner of the envy, and if he finds his heart with his heart, he will be removed from his heart The blessing is from others, so those who are left of God are exempted from that, and perhaps this is what is meant by his saying, peace be upon him: And the bird, then he said: He has a premature one of them, if you envy, then do not devote it.Al -Ghazali Sheikh, may God have mercy on him.* * * The third question: in the paths of envy, Al -Ghazali, may God have mercy on him, said: It is four: the first: to love the removal of that grace, and if this is not for him, this is not for him.And the second: that the disappearance of that grace loves it to him, and that is the same as his desire in a good house or a beautiful woman, or a wilayah, who is a watery of it.It is for him, so what is required of the self is his obtaining for him.The third: that he does not desire it, but it is united for itself, like it, for if it is a miracle of its likeness, I love its demise, so that it does not appear between them.The quarter: that it is desired for itself, like it, then it is not to obtain, then it does not love its demise, and this is the last one who is pardoned for it if it is in The world, and the delegate to it, if it is in religion, and the third of them is defamful and other than defamatory, and the second is more than the third, and the first is a purely defamatory; He said: Do not wish for what God preferred with him with some of you [Women: 32] So you wish him for the same as that other than that * * * The following question: The Sheikh of the Ghazali mentioned the mercy of God, upon him the grace of seven reasons: He is angry with him, and that anger is born of the right, and the jurisprudence requires recovery and revenge, for if the miracle of hateful of the healing is for the healing of the healing of it Time, with whom it has become a nose of his enemy and a joy, and whatever it has been afflicted with his goodness, and that is because he is against his goal, so the envy is from the boundaries of the ever, It is possible in this section that that hostility does not appear from itself, and that this state is distracted from itself, but he hates a person, then you will see it, This is not possible, and this type of envy is the one who described the disbelievers with it, as he said: And if he found you, they said: We believe in us, and if they leave you, they will be upon you.Knowing the same breasts if you are touched by goodness, and if you become bad, they will be happy with it [Al -Imran: 119, 120], and so he said: They have not been given what you have been in 118].He knew that the envy may have led to the conflict and fighting.(P-217) It is not from his abuse to grow up, but his abuse is to pay his old age, because he may be satisfied with his prayers, but he does not accept his lifting of it.The third reason: that it be in his manner that he will be used otherwise, and he wants to remove the grace of that other than that, so that he can be able to do so, and this is the abuse of this The disbelievers of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, said: How can we give us a boy who is orphaned, and how do we lend to our heads?And they said: Were it not for this Qur’an on a man from the two villages of the two villages, [Al -Zukhruf: 31] And he said: The Almighty said: Like the ritual of them and the nose of them.The Lord: The admiration is as God told about the past nations, as they said: You are nothing but an human being like us [Yass: 15], and they said: I believe in our good [The Believers: 47], and they said: “God sent a messenger” [Al -Israa: 94] and they said: If not for the angels, the angels are revealed to us [Al -Furqan: 21] and he said: To warn you [Al -A'raf: 63].The fifth causes: fear is from the dead of the purposes, and that specializes in the crowds on one of the one, for each one of them engraves the owner of the owner He is his intention in the rhetoric with its integrity, and from this section, the harm is engraved in the crowding over the purposes of the wife The two parents are to communicate to the purposes of money and dignity, as well as the preachers who were crowded with the people of one country, as their abundance was the money of the money.The sixth reason: the love of Al -Raysah and the request of the Ja’ah himself from otherwise he is given to him to his intention, and that is like a man who wants to be the enemy of the angry If he had heard with a theorizing of him in the far world, he worsened that, and he loved his death and the demise of the blessing that he shared in the house of courage or knowledge or knowledge, As it is unique.The reason for the seven: the scarcity of the soul is good for the worshipers of God, for you find someone who does not occupy with a hoof, a greater, or a demand for money, if it is described by the authority This is a hardship for him, and if the peoples of the people are forced, the people of the people are forced, and their lives are overwhelmed, and he will be happy with it, so he never loves the adulterers, and the one who is in the way of it, As if they take from that of his kingdom and his treasury, and it is said: The horses are those who have left the minds other than him, so this is the stinging of the blessing of God, upon the servants An enmity and no connection, and this has no phenomenon except the malice of the soul, and the virtue of its mountain in the print; Because the birds of the types of envy fence his demise to remove his reason, and this is a malice in the jellyfish that is not due to an exhibiting reason, so his removal is difficult.This is the causes of envy, and some of these reasons may be gathered, or more or all of them in one person, so he glorifies in it the envy, and the power of it is strong.The hidden and the complexion, but the veil of the complexion is destroyed, and the enmity appears in the reveals, and the most envious of which is in which a sentence of these causes is gathered in it.* * * Fifth question: in the cause of the many envy, its decrease, its strength, and its weakness.Know that the envy is that there is a lot among the people in which the reasons that we mentioned, as the one person is permissible to be envied, because it is the one who is forbidden.Because it is arrogant, and because (P-218) is an enemy of other causes, and these are the reasons, but there are many people who are in their ways The speeches, and are on purposes, and the dispute is the opponent of the income, and the opponent is leading to the envy, where there is no mixture, then there is no envy, and there is no grave Two people in two countries, there is no crime, and they were not envious, so this is seen The scientist envy the scientist without the cross, and the worshiper enacted the scabs without the scientist, and the merchants embrace the merchant, but the mquis is the throat of the mockery, and does not envy, and does not envy, The man is his brother and son of his cousin more than what is envied, and the woman envies her harm and the secret of her husband is more than what is envied by the mother of the mother and his son.Because the intention of the bond is unable They do not crowd the intentions, and then the crowd of the gazelle has more than the crowd of the distant from the market of the market, and the sentence is the origin of the enemy The crowding is on one syntax, and the single syntax does not collect two followers, but only two appeals are unanimously The illness and the fasting in the world of the world, for it envies everyone in the world from those who share it in the characteristic that he is proud of, I say: And the reason for the right is that the With the self, and against the loved ones, and from the sentences of the kindness of the uniqueness in the talisman, then the part of the evils in the cumin was hated to be a ritual in the way The doors of Al -Kamal, except that this type is from the fullness, when he prevented his obtaining except for God, his grace, and the despair signed from him, so he sought the envy of the affairs of the world It is fulfilled by the crowds, but the hereafter is not narrow in it, but the example of the last is the grace of knowledge, so there is no crime of those who love the knowledge of God, and the knowledge of God, and the knowledge of God.He envies others if he knows that; Because the knowledge does not narrow the person, but the one who knows it is known to a thousand thousand, and rejoices with his knowledge, and he will be given to him, and he does not, and he does not.Rather, he gets a lot of people with the increase in mankind, so this is not among the scholars of religion, envious; Because their intention is to know the knowledge of God, and it is a wide sea that is not narrow in it, and their abuse of the house is with God and there is no narrowness in it, yes, if the scholars mean the knowledge and the knowledge of the money; Because the money is an enemy if it is located in a single hand, the hand of the other, and the meaning of the ignorant is full of heart A heart was filled with joy with the knowledge of God, and that is not forbidden to fill the heart of others, and that he will be happy with it, so that God has said: Their breasts of a brotherhood on the essence of the opposite ever [Al -Hijr: 47].* * * The sixth question: in the depicted medicine for the envy, which is two things: science and work.As for science, it has two resolutions: a blatant, and a detailed.Because the subject did not end up to the duty, he did not stand, and when it was like that, no Infidel in the alienation from it, and if it is satisfied with the judiciary, the envy is removed.As for detailing, it is that you know that the envy is a harm to you in religion and the world, and that there is no harm in the religion and the world, but it is in the religion, but it is in the debt, but it is in the religion, but it is in the debt.A harm to you in the debt, and from the faces of it: one of them: that you are with the envy, you have disgraced the ruling of God and His ritual in his division that he divided into his servants, and his servants, and his servants, and his servants, and he will be in his servants.Its wisdom, and this is a crocodile at the beasts of al -Tuhidah, and rescued in the eyes of faith.And the second: If you are deceived by a man from the believers, you will be separated by the guardians of God in their love for the good of the worshipers of God.Paily.And the third of it: the great punishment that arises in it in the hereafter, and as for it, it is a harm to you in the world, so it is that you are in the cause Of the types of blessings, so do not torture every blessing (P-219) that you see and you will suffer with every night that you are leaving for them, so you will never be a miserable, so they will be a miserable Get it to your enemies and want your enemies to obtain it for you, so you would want the insult to your enemy, so you seemed to get the insult to your soul.Then, if this is the domination of you, if you give you the illness of your body, and remove the validity of you, and your slope in the souls, and we will be disclosed to you for the pleasure of the ritual and the drink.As for it, there is no harm in the matter in his religion and its world is clear; Because the blessing does not go away from it with your envy, but rather what God has destroyed in terms and grace, so it is necessary and it is necessary for it to last for the sake of God, for all of it, for all of it, for all of it.A book, and what the grace did not go away with the envy, and the chaos is not a harm in the world, and there is no sin in the hereafter, and perhaps you say: “If only The charity is with my envy, and this is the end of ignorance, for it is a way that you desire first for yourself May God bless you, neither in religion nor in the world, and if you desire that the grace goes away from the creation with your envy, and do not go away from you, then you will be, then you will go away, and this is the goodness of you One of the fools of the envy is desires to summarize this special, and you are not with that of others, so the blessing of God is upon you that you did not go away from the grace, And you are ignorant of it.As for the prejudice, he intends for it in religion and the world is clear, but its benefit in the debt is that it is an umbrella from your destination, not if you go out of the good And the praise is in it, and you will be a mobilization, and the remembrance of his misfortunes, for it is gifts that God guides to him, meaning that you guide you to your goodness, so you are a little We said to his goodness, your goodness, and your sorrows are clouded, as if you were insulting to the removal of the blessings of God from you, so the blessings of God were removed from you, and it was not for you, Single, and his benefit in the world, and from his faces: The first: that the most important purposes of creation are the evening of the performance, and their being is darkened The envy, but the sane person does not desire the death of his enemy, but wants the length of his life; Let him be in the torment of envy, to look at all times and to the blessings of God on him, and his heart will be cut off with that, and for that it was said: God does not died From you who extends, you are not immoral at a grace ∗∗∗, but the whole is the one who envy the second: that people know that the misfortune is necessary and that it is a good With the envy of the enchanting, as it is devoted to God with the types of silver and veiled, and the greatest of the virtue is what is unable The evidence is the equivalent of the signs with the types of silver and the veiled.The third: The envious becomes a defamatory between the creation with the Creator, and this is one of the greatest intentions of the person.The lobby: It is that it is a reason for the pellets of Ebis; That is because the envious when he left the virtuous one who has sought the misfortune with it, then if it is satisfied with that, the great reward is required, so he feared that he is satisfied with that It is necessary for that reward, so when he was not satisfied with it, but the envy showed that reward, and the punishment is obligatory, so he will become a reason for the joy of the Lord.Fifth: You have a man who envy a man from the people of knowledge, and loves to make mistakes in the religion of God, reveal his mistake to make it clear, and loves to make it clear to him It speaks, or is satisfied until he does not know or learn, and any sin that increases that, and any of this is a luxurious arrangement of this.And he appeared from this face, O envy, that you are the reward of those who throw a stone to his enemy to afflict him with his killing, so he does not afflict him, but he will go back to him Then his anger will be more, so he will return and throw it second more than the first, so he returns the stone on his other eyes, and he blinds him, so he will increase his anger, and he will return to a third, and he will return to a third, and he will return to a third, and he will return So he encourages him, and his enemy is good in all the conditions, and the parallel is always returned to him, (P-220) and his enemies around him are happy with him and laugh at him, but the state of this Because the waged stone was only missed the eye, and if it remained, she would have died with death, and his envy is that he is the anger of God and to the fire, so let him go to the fire It is better for him to have a eyes and enter the fire, so see how God will take revenge on the envious if he wants to disappear the grace from the misfortune, so what is removed from it, so what is removed from it The grace of the envious is a believer in his saying: The bad man does not suffer except with his family [Fatir: 43] This is the scientific medicine, so they are the same as the one who thinks about it.And the heart of the present, the fire of the fire, as for the beneficial work, it is to come with the anti -action of the requirements He wrapped his praise for his tongue, and if he carried him on the arrogance of him, he wrapped his soul, the humility for him, and if he carried it on the pieces of the reasons for the goodness of the goodness of the good To him, so the meaning of the envy, that was the good of his heart and the love of the envious, and that is the other thing that is the last thing to the disappearance of the envy of the one who is: the first: that the one who loves The envy loves him, then the envious becomes a loved one for the envy, and the envy goes away at that time.The second: that if the envy comes against the merits of the envy on the way of the cost, then the hereafter becomes a pride of it, and the envy will be removed from it.* * * The seven question: Know that the alienation is based on the heart of the enchanting of the prejudice, something other than in its capacity, so how is it punished for it?As for the one who is in his capacity: one of them: his being is satisfied with that alienation.The second: the emergence of the effects of that blow from the praise is in it, and the intention to remove that grace from it, and the reasons for the love of it were done to it, so this is the inside of the time Interpretation: As for his saying, a lot of people of the book, if they would return you after your faith, disbelievers, so what is meant is that they would want the return of the believers from the faithful It turns out to them that faith is right and right, and the world is that he is not a right that is not permissible to want his response to him except with a similarity that he throws to him; Because the right is no longer from the right with a similarity, and the suspicion of two: one of them: what is connected to the minority, which is that it is said to them: you have learned from you, from you To you, and you will be afraid of you, so leave the faith that your legs to these things.And the second: in the chapter of religion, by wasting the likeness in miracles, or prohibiting what is in the teeth.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: a envy of themselves, and he has books: the first question: that it is exalted, indicating that their love is that they would return from the faith - for the sake of faith.Al -Jubayi said: I mean by his saying: an infidel of envy from themselves, that they did not come from that of the exalted, and that their disbelief is the one who does not, from them.That his saying: From themselves in it in it, it is one of them: it is related to the “friend” in the sense that they loved that after what you have to do so Do you wish them by seeking the right?.The second: It is attached to a “envy”, meaning: a great envy sent by themselves.As for his saying Hope: Pardon and forgive this, so this indicates that Jews after they wanted to tell the believers from faith (P-221), they are in the face of the righteousness He commanded them to be pardoned and forgiven on the face of satisfaction with what they did; Because that is an infidel, so it is obligatory to carry it on one of the two things: the first: that what is meant is left the opposite and the symptoms of the answer; Because that is close to the silence of the revolution in the time, as if he was up to the Messenger of Pardon and Safah from the Juda Exalted: Say to those who believe, forgive those who do not hope the days of God [Al -Jathiya: 14] and his saying: And their migration is a beautiful migration [Al -Muzammil: 10] and for that, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for that, and for you, and for you, and for that, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, for you Rather, he commented on him with an absence, and he said: Until God comes to his command and mentioned in it, it is one of it: one of it: that the reward is the day of resurrection from the good.And the second: the power of the Messenger and the many of his nation.And the third: It is the saying of the most companions and the followers, that it is the matter of fighting; Because he has one of the two things: either Islam, or the subjugation of the payment of the reward and the burden of humiliation and the young, for this, the scholars said: This is this Exalted: Fight those who do not believe in God nor the last day [Repentance: 29] “And on the authority of Al -Baqir - may God be pleased with him - that he did not command the Messenger of God.Peace be upon him, with his saying, ears for those who fight that they were wronged.After the conquest of "Badr, and we are two questions: The first question: How to be woven while he is stuck with an absence as saying: Then you will fast the fast to the night: The night is a copyist, so we are here, the answer: that the end that the matter is suspended if it is only known as a law that does not come out of that unit by the one who is a law Say it: Pray and forgive until you copy it from you.The second question: How do they pardon and forgive, and the infidels were the people of the thorns and power, and the forgiveness is only for a capacity?The answer is that a man from the Muslims was attained by harm, and he appreciates that situation before the fulfillment of the commissions to pay his enemy from his soul, and that he is his soul.God Almighty has pardon and forgiveness, so that they will not resist evil and fighting.The second saying: In interpretation, his saying: Pray and forgive the good of the call, and use what is required in it from the advice, the agreement, and the strictness of this, and this is not in it, Its copy is permissible, but its copy is permissible for the first interpretation.As for His Excellency: God is able to be able, and it is a warning to them, whether it is borne by the matter by fighting or otherwise.
