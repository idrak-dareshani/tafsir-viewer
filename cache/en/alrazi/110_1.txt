The Quranic researcher (P-138) (Surah Al-Nasr).They are three verses, civil.In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful.If the victory of God comes.In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful.If the victory of God comes in the verse of the people: one of them: that it is up to the greatness of the great educator with his saying: And the soul of your Lord will give you: [4] He gave you the Kawthar [Al -Kawthar: 1] There was no crime that was closing every day of his matter, as if he said: O Muhammad, why did you narrow your heart, did you not be when you did not I supported you with the Apostle, and in the first message I increased, and I made the bird an angel: It is not enough for you to give you three thousand thousand [Al -Imran: 124] I support you with myself: If the victory of God comes, then he said: God is only the grace if you are open to me, the house This is a pleasure in that?He said: And I saw people enter the religion of God, then, as if he said: Do you know, Muhammad, with any reason, and you found this three -scoops?Rather, you found it because you said in the advanced surah: O infidels, I do not worship what you worship [the disbelievers: 1], and this includes three things: the first: the first: the first: His reward: If the victory of God comes.And the second: The Mecca of your heart opened with the insertion of the neutrality, so we gave you, and it opened the Mecca, which is what is meant by its saying, and the conquest.The third: You entered the parishes of your wounds and your members in my obedience and my servants, so I also entered my servants in your obedience, and it is what is meant by his saying: they enter the religion of God After that I found this three immorality, then I sent me three types of slaves: they threw up with you Get up, ask forgiveness, but put in an interview: the victory of God, praise him; Because the praise is the eagerness of God from the similarity of the events, it means that you see that it is your victory, so you think that it is (P-139), but we support you; Because you are worthy of that victory from him, but he believed that he is a balance from him that one of the creation is due to him, then he made it in Because the blessing cannot be met only with praise, then he made the interviews of people in the religion of seeking forgiveness, and it is what is meant by his saying: and for your saying: And the believers [Muhammad: 19], that is, the many followers, which occupies the heart with the pleasure of the ignorant and the acceptance, so seek forgiveness for this destiny from your sins, and seek forgiveness for the sins of them.Their sins were more, so their argument was to seek forgiveness more.The second face: He is peace be upon him, when he disavowed the infidels and faced them as bad in his saying: Oh, the infidels [the infidels: 1] As if some people were afraid, he was less than that roughness.With the victory to you: If the victory of God comes to his counterpart: It is only fired to the titles of two situations: Glory be to whom he caused his servant [Al -Israa: 1] Rather, I am more than this, so I prefer your nation to your nation over the richness With the victims, they will take it as a place, so if the poor remain from other than the stretching the market of paradise to it: and the paradise was removed to the righteous [poets: 90].The third face: as if it was his pneumators, he said: O Muhammad, the world does not describe its destiny, and its custody does not sleep, and we do not sleep.Where they said: Worship our gods until we worship your God, and when he disappeared from them and his heart was narrowed from their face, he said: He greeted, so he came to the victory of God, so he said: Al -Raheel, but you knew that it is necessary after the disappearance, so seek forgiveness, O human, do not grieve from the hunger of the Lord, so he sought the richness of the perpetrator, and the richness of the excess, and the richness The wildness of the winter, so as the one who has been raised, does not remain for him except for others and from him: ؎ If an issue is completed, it will be shortened, so that it is said if it is said that you will not do so, then do you do?He said: Until we do not put your heart on the world, but you will never be at the wandering of the raid and travel.The lifted face: When he said in the last of the advanced surah: You have your debt and the debt [the disbelievers: 6] So he said: He is my divinity and what is my reward?He said: The victory of God, and he says: What is the reward of my uncle when he called me to the worship of idols?He said: I would like a father to be a flame [Al -Masad: 1].We said: Lojoh: one of it: because his mercy preceded his anger.And the second: Let the sex be connected to the anise, for he said: I have a debt, and he is the victory as his saying: the day of the faces of the faces of it and the lords of the face of the face of the face [Al -Imran: 106].And the third of it: the end of the promise is more important in the generosity of the righteousness, so it is contemplated in these committees that occur between this fence, with this one of the lights from this In the city, and that surah is one of the families of what has come down with Mecca, so that he will know that this man is from God and his command.Fifth face: that in the advanced surah he did not remember anything from the names of God, but he said: “What is worshiped.So they will increase their minds, and in this surah he mentioned the greatest of his names; Because it is a descendant of the loved ones, so that their rewards are greater, as if they were praised, he said: Do not remember my name with the disbelievers until he does not The first is to honor it.The sixth face: The grammarians said: If it is erected in praise, and the appreciation, then praise the praise of your Lord if the victory of God comes, as if he said: You want it, which is victory, conquest, and blowing, and fill that cure from these things, and I sent it to you, so do not return it to me, and the abundance Meaning: They threwed with love, as if Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: With what thing (P-140), do you know your guidance, and I am a poor?And God says in the sense: If you do not find anything else, then no less than the sacrifice of the tongue with praise, praise and forgiveness, so when he did the prayers of the peace and peace be upon him They were guilty, not the crime of love, for this was Muhammad, the love of God.The following face: as if it is the Almighty saying: If the victory and the conquest come to you and the entry of people in your religion, then you will be able to be praise, praise, and the omit You thank you for increasing you, and it will become your obedience to this obedience because of the increasing of your degrees in the world and the hereafter, and you are still in the way of promotion until the end of the We gave you a lot.The eighth direction: that faith is fulfilled by two things: the negation, the evidence, the righteousness and the state, for the negation and the brightness say it: I do not worship what is worshiped His saying: If the victory of God comes, then this is the college of the whole attached to this surah.Know that in the verse is a secret, but it can be evaluated in the exposure of the question and the answer.The first question: What is the difference between the victory and the conquest until the conquest is overwhelmed by victory?The answer is from faces: one of them: the victory is the help of the one who is required, and the conquest is the acquisition of the one who was attached He began with the remembrance of victory and the conquest of the conquest of it.And the second: it is impeded to be said: the victory is like the honor of religion, and the openness of the world, which is the perfection of the grace, and the counterpart of this verse is the saying of you: My blessing [Al -Ma’idah: 3] and the third of it: the victory is the nail in the world on the semen, and the conquest of paradise, as he said: Its chapters were opened [Al -Zumar: 73] Quraysh or on all Arabs.The second question: that the Messenger of God ﷺ was ever published by signs and miracles, so what is the meaning of the discretion of the victory of the conquest of Mecca?The answer is from two voices: one of them: What is meant by this victory is the equivalent victory for the chapter, but it was made for the absolute victory indicating this victory Because this victory is to greatly fall from the hearts of the people of the world, it was made before it is like the one, as the reward for the entry of paradise is as if it is a good A cat, and to This meaning is the sign of the Almighty saying: And they will be removed until the Messenger and those who believed with him will say when God bless him [Al -Baqarah: 214].And secondly: Perhaps the intention of God in the affairs of the world, which he ruled for his prophets as his saying: If God comes, if he comes, it is not delayed [Noah: 4].The third question: The victory is only from God.And the answer is with a victory that does not fit except with God, and it is not appropriate for him to do it except God, or he only fulfills his wisdom, and it is said: This is a purpose of Zaid, if it is an increase, if it is a good.What is meant by it is the most of that industrialization, so we are, or the victory of God because it is an answer to their prayers: when God will help him, then he says this is the one who asked him.The following question: The description of the victory with the coming is metaphor and its right to his right if the victory of God is located, so what is good is in leaving the truth and the remembrance of the metaphor?The answer contains references: One of them is that the affairs are attached to their sizes and that it is the most powerful for the limits of every sharp, appointed reasons and the capabilities in which it is destroyed in the way.And absenteeism and change, then if that time is attended, and that time (P-141) came with that the effect, and the indication is with it: We download it except with a known destiny [Al -Hajar: 21].And the second: that the memorization indicated that the victory was like the detence to Muhammad ﷺ; That is because that victory was due to him with the judgment of the promise, so the requirement was supplied, except that the successor of the effect was for the poor of the condition, so the condition is like the condition His weight requires the identity, except that the relationship is forbidden, and the convergence is like a detence to the passion, so this is the victory, as it was a detence to Muhammad ﷺ.And the third of it: that the world of numbers is a world that has no end to it, and it is the world of darkness, except that in its slope, there is generosity and mercy, and it is the righteousness of God and its creation, then the righteousness of the Al -Salalan, and its teeth requires in every time and its prayers to a position and a certain place, so the sailor of the mercy and blessings of God was taking into account the sake of the sake of the sake Repent and bring it to you and its coming to you, so if the waves of this sea come to you, then be able to praise, praise and forgiveness, then these three are the one who is the one who is the one who does not The sailor of the grapes except with it, and for this reason when your father instilled Noah, the sea of ​​the abundance and the arrogance, he used to say it: in the name of God and its mourning.[Hood: 41].The fifth question: There is no doubt that those who helped the Messenger of God ﷺ on the opening of the Mecca are the companions of those who are immigrants and supporters, then he called the victory of God: What is the reason for the verb that is sincere from them In addition to God?The answer: This is a sea that explodes from the sea of ​​the secret of the judiciary and destiny, and that is because their action is the action of God, and it is reported that their actions are supported to what is in the hearts of the hearts, Those with the reasons and the streets are severe things, so there must be of an event and it is not the servant, otherwise it is necessary to sely, so it is necessary that God be exalted, then the first person is the first The distant is God Almighty, and the principle is the closeness is the servant, so from this adoption, the added victory has become added to the companions with its eyes added to God Almighty, for this is the one who said: You mentioned the action of the servant who is separated from the act of God Almighty, and this violates victory; Because he said: If you support God, he will be victorious [Muhammad: 7], so he will make our victory to him presenter to his support for us and the answer: that there is no comprehension in the truth of the truth Because of the reactions of us, then the verb from us is attributed to another verb that releases the Lord, for the causes of the testes and their causes are a messenger on the authority It is miraculous to perceive the most of the human beings.The sixth question: the word: (if) for the future, then it is what he mentioned and a promise to be accepted by the victory, he said: If the victory of God comes, then the soul is mentioned.When he said: And if a victory came from your Lord, they would say [Al -Ankabut: 10] so he mentioned it with the words of the Lord, so what is the reason in that?Answer: Because he was after the existence of the verb, he became a Lord, and before him what was a Lord, but he was God.The following question: It is up to God: If you support God, he will be victorious, and peace be upon him, peace be upon him.This promise is that God will be victorious, so he does not go, he said: If the victory of God comes, then do you say that this victory was more obligatory for him?The answer: that what is not a duty may become a duty and a promise, and this is said: The promise of the generous is obligatory from the debt of the deceased, how is it obligatory for the father, and the father of the father, and the son of the father, His servant, but the victory is obligatory for the foreigners if it is assigned to be one of the agreement, and if it is busy with the same prayer, then (P-142), this is the right So he promised him with the generosity, and he is more than his servant from the father of his son and his child with his servant, and he is the guardian of the behavior of the king, and he was born with the reckoning of the authority, Second to him, and he is obligated to him and the generosity of his slave, so he said: If the victory of God comes.* * As for his words, the Exalted: (And the conquest), in it, the first question: the first question: It was transferred from Ibn Abbas that the conquest is the conquest of Makkah, and it is the
