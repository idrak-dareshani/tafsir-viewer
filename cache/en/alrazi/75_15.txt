The researcher is the Almighty: And if he would be excused for the interpreters, there are sayings: The first: The one said: The excuses are a whole excuse, it is said: An excuse and an excuse.The owner of the “scout” said the collection of excuses, and the excuses are not an excuse, but it is the name of a group for it, and the grace of the other in the man He himself, he ran out of it, and he came with all excuses and an argument, because he does not benefit him because he is a witness to himself.The second saying: Al -Dahhak, Al -Saddi, Al -Farah, Al -Mubarrad, and Al -Zajaj said: The one is the one who is the one who is one of them is an excuse.The owner of the “scout” said: If this narration is authenticated, then that is a metaphor from where the stir is prevented the vision of the inspector, as the excuse is prevented The saying: that if he asks the hardship to hide what he does, then his soul is a witness to it.Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it in it: the first question: the leaders of the people of the feet of the arms that this Qur’an has been unjust, and it is not, and it is not.And they needed it that there is no occasion between this verse and between what was accepted, and if this repentance was from God Almighty, the matter was not like that.He knows that in the two appearances in the first place: the first: it is enticed to be the prohibition of the prohibition of it, but it agreed for the Messenger, peace be upon him, for him, for the one who is to be removed from him.We are forbidden from that trap in this time, and it was said to him: Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it, and this is as the one who is taught, then he will be thrown, then he will be thrown on The recovery is wrapped in the right and north, and the one says in the past of that gear, do not fulfill the right and north, then return to the lesson, so if this is transferred to this, then this is transferred to that.Date of it, so whoever does not know the reason, says: that the word of that word is in the past of that lesson, it is not appropriate, but whoever knows the fact that it is the knowledge of the knowledge.And the second: that it is transcendent from the infidels that they love (P-197), the urgent happiness, and that is his saying: Rather, he wants the human being to separate in front of him, then he will be in front of him, and then he will be in front of him, and then Related to miracle in the matters of religion, so he said: Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it and said in the last verse: “No, but you love the speed.” And the third of it: that he said: Rather, the human being on himself is insightful, and if he would be excused, then the Messenger ﷺ shows the miracle in the readers with the ritual, and he was a mourning, In it the fear of the forgetfulness, as if it was said to him: If you come with this excuse, but you know that the memorizer does not get the success of God, and this is the time And intend for the guidance of God Almighty, and this is what is meant by his saying: Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it.His collection and Qur’an.And he pushed it: As if he was upset, he said: O Muhammad, if you are exhausted from this hurry to keep it and inform them of them, but there is no need for this, for this is the human being, With their hearts, they know that the one who is on the disbelief and the worship of the second and the denial of the resurrection is false, then if you are your abuse from this miracle, they are the same This definition has obtained it, then it is not possible for this inconvenience to this hurry, so it is not a crime, he said: Do not move with it for your tongue.Fifth: He is the Almighty, he told the infidels that he says: Where is the passion, and then he said: “No, not to be visited to your Lord, the one who is stable, and the infidel, as if he was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is that It was said to Muhammad: You are asking for the Qur’an to seek help from the Qur’an, and this is the use of you without God.It was said: The infidel escapes from God to others, and you are like the opposite to Him, so you must escape from the other than God to God and that you seek all of the people, What is meant by what he said: We have all of us and his Qur’an and he said in another surah: And do not hurry with the Qur’an before before you will spend his life and say: In order to seek the memorization of the righteousness, but ask him from God Almighty.And its sixth: what the lock mentioned is that it is saying: Do not move with it for your tongue, it is not a speech with the Messenger, peace be upon him, but rather a speech with the person who is the one who is the one who is the one who says: Then, what was presented and late, so that was for a person if he predicts the openings of his actions, and that is that his book is presented to him, so he said to him, so he said: The day is upon you [Al -Asraib: 14] If he takes in the readers, he will leave for his tongue from the severity of fear and the speed of the readers, so he will be said to him: Do not move him to him, so that he will be blessed with him.It is obligatory for us with the judgment of the promise or the judgment of the rule that we will collect your business on you and to read it to you, so if we read it to you, then follow it.Acts, then we have his command and explain the paths of his mind, and he gets the matter of interpretation of this verse that what is meant by it is that he is the one who reads to the one who reads to all The way of detailing, and in it the most severe in the world and the most intense in the hereafter, then the lock said: This is a good face that is not in the mind, and it is the one who pays it.The second question: He who has been permitted by the prophet to the Prophet, peace be upon them, with this verse, so he said: That is the ritual of God?And if it is not with the permission of God, then the sin was issued by him?Answer: Perhaps that is the argument They are permissible in it to the time of the prohibition on it, and it is not far from the time that the thing is permissible in it at a time and then it becomes a distance from it at another time, and this is the same.The third question: Sa`id ibn Jabir narrated from Ibn Abbas, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ was the conservation of the revelation, and if he came down to him And he looked at him before the emptiness of Jabriel, fearing that he would not be preserved.He has a remembrance of the state of the situation on him, as (P-198) was added in his saying: We sent him down on the night of destiny [Al-Qaddar: 1], and we say it: His life is eliminated to you [Taha: 114] and his saying: Let him hurry with him, meaning: to hurry to take it.As for his words, the Almighty is: We have his collection and his Qur’an, and he has anxes: the first question: the word “on” for the obligatory, so he said that it is upon us that is upon us.God is exalted, but on our gold, then that is the one who has the ruling on the ruling of the promise On the authority of the forgetfulness, then it was a duty of wisdom.
