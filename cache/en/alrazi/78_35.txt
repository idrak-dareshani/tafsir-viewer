The Quranic researcher is the first: His Excellency said: The righteous have a reward for the righteous, and its interpretation has been presented in many places In the sense of a lukewarm and a buffer in the prostitute, and it is required that it be a position of lukewarm, and the louz is required to be that the one who wants to be lost, and it is the one who is overlooked.Surviving from the torment, and that the intended is the group of the two things, and for me that its interpretation of the winner with the one who is overlooking it, or from its interpretation of the sacrifice, from the sake of the sacrifice, With the width of the whole of the two things, I mean the survivor of perishing and communicating to the one who is required, and that is because it is the Almighty, so he made the reward for what is after him, and he said: It will be the intention of this vow, so it was said: the salvation of perdition is more important than the pleasure of the pleasure, so I did not neglect the most important and remind the other?We said: Because the salvation of destruction does not have the obligation of the width with pleasure and goodness.And the second: His Excellency: The Lands and Approvals and the Lands are the collection of a number, and it is two descents on it, from their saying: they are tired of it, and they are in it.(And grapes) indicates the greatest condition of those taps.And the third of it: His Exalted: And as well as the players of a gathering as a bottom, which is the bouquets that are tired of their rituals and destroyed, that is, the righteousness will be like.And the one who has been: His exaltation: and the most miserable in Dahaq: The first: It is the saying of the most people of the language, such as the father of Ubaydah, Al -Zajajj, Al -Kisa’i, and Al -Mubarak Fill out, the son of Abbas called a boy for him and said: We are given a dahqa, so the boy came with fullness, and Ibn Abbas said: This is the Dahaq, he said: He says: Wake up and threw us.The second saying: Dahaq, that is, a follower, and it is the saying of Abu Hurairah and Saeed bin Jabir and Mujahid.The severity of its tears and the entry of some of it in some, its lean mentioned, and the follower like the interrupted.The third saying: It is narrated from Akrama that he said: (Dahqa), that is, pure, and the burden on this saying, it is permissible for it to be a collection of Dahq, and it is two woods, With the wine, the laughter said: Every day in the Qur’an is a wine, the estimation: and a wine with a fatigue, that is, it was squeezed and described with the father.(P-20) Fifth: Its saying: They do not hear in it for a lord or a liar in the verse of two questions: The first: The guerrilla is in his saying: (in it) to what he returns?The answer: It is in it: The first: that it returns to the bad, that is, it does not take place between them in the case that they drink, and that is because the people of the drink in the religion, And the people of Paradise, if they are drinking, will not change Their mind, and they did not speak to a language.The second: that the kiniyah returns to paradise, that is, they do not hear in paradise anything that they hate.The second question: The liar with tension benefits the exaggeration, so its flowers are in his words, the Almighty: and lied to our verses as a suitable liar; Because it benefits the exaggeration in their description with lies, but his arrival here is a good thing; Because he said: He does not hear in it a lukewarm or a liar that benefits that they do not hear the great lie, and this does not deny that they hear the liar, and the lies of the lies, The intended exaggeration is that they do not hear the lies of the dirham, and it is possible that this memorization benefits the exile of the exaggeration and the dignity of the exaggeration in the nose.The answer is that the first read the first with tension and the second by lowering, and perhaps his abuse of what we decided in this question; Because the readings of fear here benefit that they do not hear the lies in the first place, because the liar with lightness and the lies are one because Abu Ali al -Farisi said: The source of written, if it was like that, the reader with the slightness is to benefit the exaggeration in the negation, and the readings of the tension in the first will benefit the exaggeration in the stake in the This is the reader in the two peoples on the most complete of the faces, so if we take the rule of the Kasayi, then the question is still, and if we took the readings of the tension in Al -Muqdah, it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who is the ones It is excused for his saying: they do not hear in it for a linguist or a liar, pointing to what he said from his saying: They lied to our verses as a liar, and the meaning is that this is not the same as the words The spoiled, spoiled, and the one that is connected to them is that they are free from their enemies and the hearing of their corrupt words and their words.
