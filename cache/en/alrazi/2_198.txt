The researcher of the Quran is the Almighty: there is no wing for you to be able to be a good from your Lord, so if you are from the norms, then remember God with the ritual of the forbidden, and for you, and for you Before him for those who are lost in it: the first question: in the verse is deleted and appreciated: there is no wing for you to seek the best of God.The second question: Know that the suspicion was having a sanctuary in the pilgrimage in the pilgrimage from the faces: one of them: that he was forbidden from the newness in what is before this The hypothesis of the ritual in the cause of the dispute in the lack of value and its many, so the merchant must be forbidden at the time of the pilgrimage.And the second: that the trading was forbidden at the time of the pilgrimage in the religion of the people of the ignorance, so the appearance of that is an improved thing; Because the employee with the pilgrimage is an object of the servants of God, the exalted, then this work is not stained with the worldly slander.And the third of it: that the Muslims, when they knew that it became many permissible permissible in the time of the pilgrimage, such as confusion, goodness, hunting, and missionaries with the time The pilgrimage, when it became a reason for the prohibition of confusion with the basis of the need for it, is that it becomes a reason for the prohibition of the merchants with the lack of need for it.And its lord: When the prayer is prohibited by the pre -emption of obedience, virtue of permits; It is necessary for the matter to be in the pilgrimage; This face is more suitable to make suspicions in prohibiting the work of merchants at the work of the pilgrimage, for this is the reason for the goodness of God.A forbidden, then if you know (P-146), then we say: The interpreters are mentioned in the interpretation of his saying: that you seek a virtue of your Lord, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is And his counterpart is the Almighty saying: And others will strike in the earth, they seek the grace of God [Al -Muzamal: 20] and his saying: He made you the night and the day for you Let them seek from his grace [Al -Qasas: 73] Then he who indicates the validity of this interpretation and Jahan: The first: What is narrated from the son of Ibn Masoud and the son of the son You seek a grace from your Lord in the pilgrimage.” The second: the narratives mentioned in the cause of descent.The first hobby: Ibn Abbas said: People from the Arabs were rushing from the merchants in the days of Hajj, and if the ten entered the lunch in the leaving of the sale and the purchase of the college, and they were in the college Al -Dajj; And they say: These are the dazzling, and they are not needed, and the meaning of the dag: And the relief of the weak and the food of the pious, so God removed this illusion, and he indicated that there is no wing in the merchants, then it was what it was What is before this verse in the rulings of the pilgrimage, and what is after it also in the pilgrimage, and it is his saying: If you are updated from the definitions of that, then this is indicated that this wisdom is in the time He took advantage of his remembrance.And the second novel: What was narrated “on the authority of Ibn Omar that a man said to him: We are a people who are denied, and if a people claim that there is no pilgrimage to us, and he said: He asked: And he did not respond to him until he said: There is no ward to you, so he called him and said: You are a hug.And in the sentence, this verse was descended in response to those who say: There is no pilgrimage to merchants, rewards, and beauty.And the third novel: that Okaz and a committee, and the metaphor, were leaving in the days of the name in it, and their inspections were from them, so when Islam came, they will be rewarded, and they will leave it.So they asked the Messenger of God ﷺ and this verse was revealed.And the fourth novel: Mujahid said: They were not creative in the ignorance with a definition or from me, so this verse was revealed.If the validity of this saying is proven, then it is said: More gates to this saying, carry the verse on the merchants in the days of Hajj, and the father of a Muslim, then he is the one who is the one who is a Muslim, then he is the same The pilgrimage, he said: And the appreciation: Fear in all the actions of the pilgrimage, then after that, there is no wing to you to seek a preference from your Lord and his opponent, the saying of God: So spread in the land and take advantage of the grace of God [Al -Jumaa: 10].And know that this saying is weak from the faces: one of them: the fulfillment in its saying: if you are from the norms of the definitions, it indicates that this overflow is made, then you will come to you.The trafficking falls in the time of Hajj.And the second: that the carrying of the verse on the position of the suspicion is the first of its pregnancy, not on the subject of the suspicion, and it is known that the lipstick is the merchant in the time of the pilgrimage The pilgrimage is every one who knows the solution of the trade.As for what was mentioned by the father of a Muslim from the pilgrimage to the prayer, his answer is that the prayer is connected to the prayer, so it is not valid in its vulnerability to occupy others, and the end of the pilgrimage is the one Some of them are from one, in which they are the first rule, where he was not a pilgrim.It is not said: Rather, the wisdom of the pilgrimage remains in all those abusers, with the evidence that the prohibition of the kindness, the dress, and their proverbs are remaining, because we say: This is a measure in the absence of the (P-147) The third saying: that what is meant by the Almighty saying: that you seek a grace from your Lord is that the person seeks the state of his place as a pilgrimage, a place of time For the sake of the grace of God and his mercy, such as the weakness of the weak, the relief of the golden, and the feedback of the brought, and this saying is forgotten to Abu Jaafar Muhammad.Peace be upon them, and the judge was subjected to him that this is a duty or a delegate, and it is not said in his example: No wing You have to be mentioned in it, but this is mentioned in the permissible.The answer: We do not recognize that this memory is not mentioned except in permissible, and the evidence is upon him the words of the Almighty: there is no ward to you to shorten the prayer and the one who does not pray Also, the people of the ignorant people were hurting that the hedge of obedience to the pilgrimage signs a vineyard in the pilgrimage and lacks in it, so God has shown that the command is that there is no matter A wing of you [Al -Baqarah: 236].* * * The third question: they agreed that the merchants if it is a shortage of obedience, it is not permissible, but if it is not signed, we are cut off from the core in it.Leave it, because the Almighty said: And they are commanded only to worship God, who are glorified to Him, the religion [Al -Banna: 5] and the devotion is that he does not have a pregnant woman, and he is a pregnant woman.Peace be upon him, a story about God Almighty: “I am the richest of the riches of the evil, whoever does a work in it, otherwise I will leave it and share it.Summary.And the Almighty said: If you are from the norms, then remember God with the forbidden poet; It contains issues: the first question: the rush in the path in a lot, and from it it is said: the camel is overlooked with his wage.Its gathered, then its light is separated, and the water is overflowing from this; Because if it is a separation, and the opposite is in the hadith, it is the rush in it with a lot of proliferation and disagreement in its faces, and it is upon him the saying of the Almighty: when they are overlooked: 61] For people: a floor, and also their collection is a pharmacy, and it is said: The eye was bruised, and the origin of this word is the payment of the thing until it is separated.So the Almighty said: You have been in any way, and you have been a lot of people The hadith of Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him: The second question: the norms of a nose, which were called a single seat, such as their saying: an ethical garment, and a tine of the tenth, and the land of the custodian, as if A piece of that land is a custom, so the group of the group of that cut is with definitions.And in al -Sabban: the disagreement and the ritual!We said: This is the memorial in the original, a name for a many cuts from the earth, each one of them is called a definition, and on this estimation, it was not the knowledge of it.For a group of that cut, then they left it after that at its origin in the numbers of the scourge.* * * The third question: Know that the eighth day of the Hajj is called on the day He was named with definitions, And they mentioned in the ups of these names and faces; As for the day of the narration, then it is said: one of them: whoever narrated it is narrated, if you think and do his thought and narration.The second: Whoever narrates from water, he narrates it if he wore it from thirst.As for the first: he has three sayings: (p-148) one of them: that peace be upon him, he commanded the building of the house, so when he was thinking about you, he said: Lord, for all of the workers, for all of the workers?He said: If you have forgiven you, your sins are forgiven for you, the first of your rituals, he said: Oh Lord, more Take forgiveness from him from the merits of your country, he said: My account, Lord, calculate me.And the second: that the prohibition of peace be upon him, he saw in his dreams the night of Tarawiyah, as if he slaughtered his son, so he became a thought of this, is this of God Almighty?When he saw him a night of knowledge, he would not have it, and he said: I knew, Lord, that he is from you.And the third of it: that the people of Mecca come out on the day of the Tarwiyah to the one who are narrated in the supplications that they want to remember in their tomorrow.As for the second saying: It is its derivation from the watering of water, in it three sayings: One of them: that the people of Mecca were hiding water for the pilgrims who were the one who intends to On this day, they will run out of the travelers of travel, and they can accommodate in the water, and they narrate with their dignitaries after their sizes, the lack of water in their way.The second: They provide water to a well -known.The third: that the sinners are like thirst and responded with the sailor of the mercy of God, and they drink from it until they were narrated, and the preference of this day is the one who said: [Al -Fajr: 3] On the authority of Ibn Abbas, that the lipstick is the one and the knowledge of the day, and the day is the day of the sacrifice, and on the authority of worshipers that he is praying and peace be upon him, he said: Like the month, and for those who fast on the day of Tarawiya, and for the one who fasts the day of the two years of two years."And Anas narrated that he is upon him the prayers and peace, he said:" Whoever fasts the day of the day The reward of Ayoub over his pain, and whoever fasts on the day of Arafa, God gave him the same as the reward of Jesus, the son of Maryam, peace be upon him.As for the day of a custom, he has ten names, five of which are specialized in it, and a fifth of it is blessed between it and between it.As for the first fifth: one of them: Arafa, and in his detection three sayings: one of them: that it is derived from the knowledge, and there are eight sayings: the first: the saying of the son Fear with a definition, so one of them was accompanied by his friend, and the day is a custom, and the position is norms, and that is that when they were looted from the garden, and the heart of Paradise, Jeddah, Abisan Benisan, and alive in their descriptions, so when God commanded the Exalted, Adam, with the Hajj, was a bowl of definitions, so it is a sense of definition.And secondly: that Adam Jabriel taught him the pilgrimage, so when he stood with a definition, he said to him: You know?Yes, he said, so he called the nations.And the third of it: the saying of Ali and Ibn Abbas, Ata and Al -Saddi: The position was called a definition because the premature peace be upon him, he knew it when he saw it from what was presented.And he paved it: that Gabriel knew Abraham, peace be upon him, the Messenger, and he connected him to the norms, and he said to him: You know how to float and in what place you stand?He said: Yes.Fifth: that his son, peace be upon him, put his son Asmail and his mother who was immoral with Mecca, and he returned to the Levant and did not fear two years, then the day of the day.And its sixth: what we mentioned from the command of the dreams of peace be upon him.And the sake of it: that the pilgrim is noting in it with definitions if they stand.And eighth: that he is the Almighty in which he knows the pilgrim with forgiveness and mercy.The second saying: In the detection of the knowledge that it is a confession; Because the arguments, if they stand in the definition, they are known to the truth with the profile, the majesty, the Samadiyyah, and the exploitation, and to themselves with the poverty, humiliation.It is said: “Adam and Hawa, peace be upon them, when he stood up with definitions, said: Our Lord has unjust ourselves, so God said,“ Glory be to Him, and I have now known to you.(P-149) And the third saying: It is one of the knowledge, and it is the good wind; He said: Paradise enters them, he introduced them to them [Muhammad: 6], meaning that it is good for them, and that is, that is that the sinners are what they repented in the krafa, so they have lost the people.And they are acquainted with him with a good, pleasant pupil, peace and blessings be upon him said: The second: the day of the infidels from the religion of Islam.The third: the day of the debt.The lord: the day of completeness of the blessing.Fifth: The Day of Radwan.And God Almighty has gathered these things in the four verses, in his saying: Today is the despair of those who disbelieved from your religion [Al -Ma’idah: 3] The verse, Omar said: The verse is a blind woman, and the day of the group and the Prophet ﷺ stand with a definition in the standing of Abraham, peace be upon him.The ignorance, so the prayer and peace be upon him: “If people know what they have in this verse, I would have established their eyes.We did not take that day as a feast, and Omar said: As for us, we made it two Eid, it was a day of knowledge and the day of the Friday.As for the meaning: Issua Al -Mashris: It is that they despair from the people of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, that they will be returned to their religion, so what is the meaning After that, with something of the buyer, and the completion of the grace, the greatest of blessings is the grace of religion; Because it deserves the lounge With paradise and salvation from the fire, and it was dumped on that day, and so he said in the verse of the ablution, and that his blessing is fulfilled on you, so that you may be blessed with you.[6] Yaqoub, he said: On which religion did you leave Joseph?He said: On the religion of Islam, he said: Now the blessing was datable, and as for the meaning of the satisfaction, it is that it is the Almighty to be satisfied with their debt A day is fully fully than the day, which he preached in it by entrusting the religion, and it was said: This day, the day of the connection of the communities, the day, I have completed your religion, and you have the religion of you.On the day of the sects of the residents that God is innocent of the two participants and His Messenger [Al -Tawaba: 3] And the day of the dismissal of the people of the people, and the acceptance of the repentance of our Lord, [Al -Araf: 23] He repented with his mercy on Adam in it, so he repents on his children and he is the one who accepts the repentance of his servants [Al -Shura: 25] And he authorized people to perform the pilgrimage, they will come to you as a man [Hajj: 27] and in the news: “The pilgrim and the redeeming of God, and the pilgrim is the visitors of God, and the right of the perpetrator to be honored.” وأمّا الأسْماءُ الخَمْسَةُ الأُخْرى لِيَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ: فَأحَدُها: يَوْمُ الحَجِّ الأكْبَرِ; God Almighty said: And the ears of God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage [Al -Tawibah: 3] This name is shared between Aarfah and Al -Muhr, and the one who is lost from In it, for those who said: It is a definition, and it is called that, because it is in it in which the kinship is with definitions, and the pilgrimage is known if it is not blessed, and it will be left.For this reason is called the greater pilgrimage.Al -Hasan said: He was named after it because he gathered in it the infidels and Muslims, and he would like to do so that he would not be involved after a polytheist, and the son of Sirin said: The feasts of the people of the boredom are all of the Jews and the Christians, and the pilgrims did the Muslims and did not gather before it or after it, and among them who said: The day of the sacrifice is that it is the day.As for Al -Waqouf, it is not obligatory on the day, but it is divided into the night, and it was narrated all on the authority of Ali and Ibn Abbas on the authority of the Prophet ﷺ.And the second: the lips.And the third: Al -Witr.And the one: the witness.Fifth: The witnesses are in his saying: and a witness and a witness [Al -Baraouj: 3] This is the names, so we made it easy in this verse.And he knows that he was the highest of a day, a familiarity between the days of the pilgrimage, with a pioneer, from it that it was the highest of his fast with a lot (p-15) reward; He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The fast of the day of Tarawiyah is the disbelief of a year, and the day of the day of the knowledge of the disbelief of two years.” And on the authority of Anas, it was said in the days He knew the twenty thousand, but it is impossible for the pilgrim to stand with definitions to break the time until it is time Supplication is strong, the heart is present.* * * The loyal question: Know that we must spread a true indication of the probation of the pilgrimage until the essence of the essence is in the sense of the verse, so the meaning of the verse is in the sense The pilgrimage or before it, if it is a paradise or compare the circumambulation of the elderly, and set up its warning until it comes out to the nations, and if it is a good and the slope of it His age and resided to the time of his elders to the norms, and then he will be deprived of the jaws of Mecca with the Hajj and come out.He speaks to the Mecca on the day of the four of the pilgrims, after the appearance of the noon, one sermon, in which the people are commanded to go away tomorrow, after the sake of the good Those, then the people go to the day of the narration to whom they will see the noon with it, and they pray with it with the imam, the noon, the murmur, the mourning, the Lord, and the Lord, Then, if the sun is pronounced on a dungeon, they will go to the norms, so if they are indebted to it, then the Sunnah is not to enter it, but it will be harmed in the imam with a nurse, and it is a kiner.So they will come there until the sun goes away, so the Imam will be spent two speeches, showing them the pilgrimage, and inciting them to the proliferation of the supplication, and the supplication is from the time, then The first sermon was sitting, then the second and permissible sermon opened, and they are taken in the call to prayer with it and relieved that it will be from it from it.The call to prayer, then it will be descended and the permission will be established, and he will pray with the noon, and then they will be evaluated immediately and prayed to them, and this group is compatible with the one who is a perpetrator, who is agreed upon.They turn to the norms, and they stand at the rocks; Because the Prophet ﷺ stood there, and if they stand, they will receive the kiss, remember God, and they call him to the sunset.And he knows that the ears are a pillar that does not realize the pilgrimage except with it, so whoever misses the wives in his time and his position, then he missed the pilgrimage, and the time of the elderly was made by It extends to the outlook of the dawn from the day of the sacrifice, and that is half a day and a full night, and if the pilgrim attends there in this time, a single moment is one of the nights or a day, and he said: Al -Wakouf is one of the soils of the day, and it extends to the outlook of the dawn from the day of the sacrifice, so if the sun is strange, the imam is driven from the krafa and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the prayer of the prayer And between the dinner in the dirt.And in the name of the dirty, it is: one of them: that they are close to it, and the diligence of the near.The second: that people are gathered in it, and the muddlafs.And the third: that they go to God Almighty, that is, they are close to the dignity, and it is said to the ritual: a group that is collected in it in a prayer Dinner and the Wester, and this is the saying of Qutdah, and it was said that peace be upon him, in which he gathered with a passion, and turns to it any of them, then if the imam came to the imam With two residences, then they will be given to it, then if there is no blood for it, then if the immorality comes, they prayed the prayer of the morning with the rituals of the ritual Others, and he is agreed upon, then if they pray the morning, they take from them the stones of the throw, and every person takes seven horsepower, and then they go to the ritual He has a sorrow, and he is what is meant by his saying: So if you are from the nations, then remember God with the ritual poet, and this mountain is the maximum of the ritual of what is from me, He could, or stand with the closeness from him if he could not, and God will re-exalted him and grow The sun was broken and the mourning is sufficient as it is in a known, then they go from it to a fascinated valley, so if they reach a fascinated stomach, then he will be disliked to whomever It was walking to seek a severe endeavor, the amount of a stone, so if they came from the threar of the obstacle of the obstruction of the valley, with seven storms, and it will be cut off, and it will be cut off, and it will be cut off, and it will be cut off.If he threw the jam of the hurry, the guidance of the guidance, if it is with him, is a gift, and that is a Sunnah, if he left it, nothing on him; Because he may not be a gift with him, then when the guidance slaughtered, his head is stuck or shortened and short Mecca and floating in the house, the ritual rituals, and the rak'ahs are prayed, and he sought between the locking and the bitterness, then after that they return to the one who is in the rest of the day.The bittout is in the way of the honesty for the sake of throwing, and they agreed on that when the throw, the throat and the tawaaf were obtained, then it was made from the solution And the conveyor and the intercourse, for this is the words of the pilgrimage and God knows.* * * Fifth question: Know that the people of the ignorance were the pilgrimage of your Messenger for the Sunnah of His Excellency, peace be upon him.With the senses, and they are the people of the severity in their religion, and the thickness is said: a man who is more red and a sense We left it at the time of obedience, and others were standing with a definition, and those who were standing with a definition were overflowing before the sun was strange, and those who stand.They are overlooked if the sun rises, and they say: I shine a dungeon, as we are, and it is meaning: I have a shining, oh, with the sun, as we are driven from the ritual It is the one who is reduced from it, and that is that they are They gave up the dirty and became in the glory of the earth, so God commanded the Almighty to be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, with the violation of the people in the defenses, and he commanded it to be one of the people, The sunset, and that it is running out of the ritual before the sun, and the verse is not indicative of that, but the Sunnah indicates these rulings.* * * The sixth question: The correctness is that the verse indicates that the acquisition with a definition is obligatory in Hajj, and that is that the verse is indicative of the heart of the remembrance The devotion is from the norms, and the devotion from the definitions of the arrival in the norms of the definitions and what is not fulfilled only by it and it was a destiny for the cost, so it is obligatory, so it is the same, so it is the same.In the definitions and obligatory in the pilgrimage, then if he does not come to him, he would not have come with the pilgrimage to him Conditioned.The most in the chapter is that the pilgrimage is to leave some of the commandments, except that the origin is what we mentioned, but rather it is amended by a separate way, and it is gone, and there is a long time In it on the fact that the dignity is a condition, and it was transferred from Al -Hasan that Al -Qaqouf is a definition and a duty, except that if he misses it, the epic of all of the sanctuaries is his place, And they agreed that the pilgrimage only obtained the kaqouf with a definition.* * * The seven question: His saying: Remember God with the forbidden poet, indicates that the incidence of the poetry is the forbidden, and it is sufficient for it, and it is sufficient for it.As for Al -Waqouf there, they are forgotten, and it was narrated from the relationship and the piston that they said: Al -Qaqouf with the ritual is a kneeling in the house of Al -Qafah, and the people of the people, If you are from the norms, then remember God with the forbidden poet, and that is because the dignity with a wedding is not mentioned in the book, but it is obligatory, but it is obligatory.The forbidden is a matter of reward, and the jurisprudence of jurisprudence said: It is not a knee, and they were taken by saying to him, peace Hajj, and with his saying: “Whoever realizes the knowledge of the pilgrimage, I will realize the pilgrimage, and whoever misses his knowledge, then he missed the Hajj.” They said: And in the verse a sign of what we said; Because God Almighty said: If you have been removed from the norms, then remember God with the forbidden poetry, commanding the remembrance, not with the dignity, so he knew that the rituals of the righteousness, And it is not originally, and the coffin is a custom, it is originally; Because he said: If you have been from the definitions, he did not say from the remembrance of customs.The eighth question: the knowledgeable poet; And the origin of it from your saying: I felt the thing if I taught it, and if my poetry did not do so, that is, my knowledge is not to reach it and surround it, and the slogan of the thing is more Placement with the forbidden poetry; Because it is a teacher of pilgrimage, then they disagreed, and they said: The ritual poet is the ritual, and God called it the Almighty; Because the prayer and the place, and the one who was shown in it and the supplication at it, so the one said by the one in “Al -Bassit” said the owner of “Al -Kafshah”: The most correct is that he is a sow, and it is the last one.The first is close; Because the fulfillment is in his saying: So remember God when the forbidden poet is indicated that the remembrance of the forbidden poet will get the obstacle of the virginity, and that is not the same Distinguished.* * * Remembering; God Almighty said: And perform the prayer for my remembrance [Taha: 14] and the evidence is upon him that he said: So remember God when the forbidden poet is a matter, and it is for the sake of this The gathering said: What is meant by the remembrance of God is praise, praise and cheerfulness, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he looked at the people in this night, and he said: The night does not sleep.* * * As for his words, he said: And mention him as he guided you, and he has asked: Deadly in this frequency?The answer is from his faces: one of them: that our anxiety is that the names of God are upright, not analogy, and he said first: Remember God, and the one who is mentioned, As a matter of you, we have a matter that we will mention it with the names and the attributes that we have indicated to us and commanded us to remember it, not with the names that we remember.And secondly: He was upset with the first remembrance, then he said secondly: And remember him as he guided you, and do what we commanded you from the remembrance, as God has guided you, for God, for God, for God.I commanded you this remembrance to be thankful for that blessing, and his counterpart is what he commanded them from the arrogance if they complete the month of Ramadan, and he said: And he said: On what guided you [Al -Baqara: 185] and he said in the sacrifices: He mocked it for you to grow up to God for what guided you.And the third of it: that his saying is first: so remember God with the forbidden poet, commanded the remembrance of the tongue, and his saying secondly: and remember it as he gave it to you.And it is reported that the remembrance in the words of the Arabs are beaten: one of them: a remembrance is against the forgetfulness, and the second: the remembrance of the saying, so what is the disagreement of the forgetfulness: Remember it [Al -Kahf: 63].[Covenant: 203] She stated that the remembrance was and responded to the two meanings.The first is: the presumption of the remembrance of the tongue.And the second: on the remembrance of the heart, then the Tamam (P-153) will obtain the slave.And his booster: Ibn Al -Anbari said: The meaning of his saying: And remember him as he guided you, it means to mention it by its murder, as it reminded you of his gifts.Fifth: It is necessary for those who are intended to be the continuation of the remembrance, as if it was said to them: Remember God and remember him, that is, remember him, as a remembrance of you, as a remembrance of this After a guidance, and he returns to his saying to his saying: O you who believe, remember God, many remembrances [Al -Ahzab: 41].And its sixth: that he is upset with the remembrance of the forbidden poet, and that is a sign of the staff of the project, then he said after it: and I remember it as well On the forbidden poetry in which there is a residence for the staff of the project, then if you know this, you approached the paths of the truth, which is that your heart will be cut off from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is from So he becomes an expulsion in the light of his majesty and his silence, and he reminds him because he is the one who deserves this remembrance, and because this remembrance gives you a blessing In this case, it will be in the place of the elderly, and it is in the place of his children, but rather began with the first and dawn in the second, because the servant is in this case, in this case, in this case, in this case, it is in this case, So it escalates from the lowest to the top, and this is an honorable position that the article does not explain and does not express the imagination, and whoever wants to reach it, let him be from the continues to the eyes For the impact.And its sake: that what is meant is the first is the remembrance of the names of God, the Almighty, and his good attributes, and what is meant by the second remembrance is to be the thanks of his soul, and the goodness of the goodness, It is correct that the thanks be called a male, and the evidence is that the second remembrance is the thank you that he was suspended by the guidance, so he said: As you have guided you and the remembrance of God.And the eighth: that he was upset when he said: So remember God with the forbidden poet, it is permissible to think that the remembrance is concluded with this seat, and this is the servant, and this is the servant, This suspicion and said: And they remember it as it guides you, it means mention it in every case, and in every place, because this remembrance is only a thank you for it The guidance is uninterrupted, as well as the thank you must be a long -term.And the ninth: that his saying: Remember God with the poetic person who is intended from the collection between my strange and dinner prayers there, then he said: From it to be essence and praise.The second question: What is meant by the guidance in his saying: As you guided you?The answer: Some of them said: It is private, and what
