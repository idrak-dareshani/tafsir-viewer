The researcher of the Qur’an is up to Him: God has no god but he is the lively living that does not take it as a year and does not have a sleep for him in the heavens and what is in the land of those who intercede for him except for him They are behind them and do not surround anything from his knowledge, except with what he wants, and his horses expand the heavens and the earth, and their memorization is not.Know that it is his habit of his grace and the exalted in this book that is the one that mixes these three types, some of them, I mean the knowledge of the rulings, and the knowledge of the rulings, What is meant by the remembrance of the stories is either the definition of the defensive, or the exaggeration in the obligation It is obligatory, but if he takes from a type of science to another type, it is as if he explains the chest with it and rejoices in the heart, so as if he is a bond of Badd Two of two bastards, and he was transferred from the eating of food that is delicious to the enemy of other types, and there is no doubt that it is the most delicious and most delicious, and when he mentioned, then it is mentioned.The stories are what he saw as a reconciliation that is now related to the knowledge of the neutrality.It was narrated from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: “This verse has been read in a house except that the Thirty Thirty Thirty -day people do not He said: I heard your prophet on the sticks of the al -Munebur while saying: “Whoever reads the verse of the Karsi in the arms of every prayer is written, and he does not prevent him from entering the paradise, but the deceased is only.A friend or a worshiper, and whoever reads it if he takes his mother, may God protect him himself and his neighbor, and his neighbor and the verses that are around him, and the companions are mentioned in Ali: Where are you from the verse of the chair?(P-4) The Qur’an, the cow, and the cow of the cow.And on the authority of Ali that he said: When the day was a day, I fought, then I came to the Messenger of God ﷺ to look at what he is making.I returned to the fighting, then I came while saying that, so I will still go and return and look at him, and he was not more than that until God opened to Him.And know that the remembrance and science follow the masculinity and the knowledge, the word is the remembrance and the knowledgeable, the honorable and the knowledge is honorable, and the honor of the mud, Rather, he is transcendent from being said: It is honored by others; Because that requires homogeneity and problems, and it is sanctified On the authority of what he has, for this reason is every word that was covered by the custody of its majesty and the attributes of its arrogance, that was the words of the majesty and the honorable, and the noble, and what is the same There is no gear, this is the same language in the honor to the maximum ends and the elimination of the ends.* * * One God, there is no god but He [Al -Qarra: 163] He remained here that we speak to the interpretation of his saying: The live alive and the son of Abbas, may God be pleased with him: God is alive, the values ​​and what we have narrated that the prayers and peace of God be upon him, what was more of his remembrance in prostration on the day of a day that indicates the greatness His health.And reports -and from God the success -that there is no doubt about the existence of the supplies, it is either that it is with its families being able, or that it is a matter It is possible and some of it is not permissible to be able to be able to be able; Because every group is a lack of one of its parts, and every one of the parts of this group is possible, and the lack of the place is the one who is able to do so.Self, and every one of its parts is possible, because it is not likely to be present on its numbers except for the success of it.And according to every one of its parts to a successful manner, and everything that was a definition of all the possibilities, it was not possible.That all the supplies are possible.As for the second division, which is said: the supplies of their families are obligatory, so this is also false; Because if he had the presence of each of them, one of them was a duty for themselves, so we were shared in the garment with the same and the two of the people, and what is in the man The permissible, so every one of them is installed in the juvenile that the partnership is, and it is not the same as the permissible, and every compound, then it is a compound, then it is a ritual, so it is a composition, so it is the one who is separated.A part other than it, and every crown is a lack of it, and it is a lack of it.Witnesses, and that is referred, and when these two sects prolonged it, it was established in the entirety of the supplies of one and one of the obligations of the existence of the same It has a fence by finding that supply that is the duty of the existence of its own, and when these two are prolonged, it is the duty of itself the existence All that it is, and all that it is, it is stated in its presence and what it is to find the duty of itself, so the duty of itself is based on itself, and the reason for it To stand up to all that it is in what it is in and in its presence, it is the lives that are alive in the proportions to all the supplies, so the resurrection is the one who is standing in the same way What is his existence and his existence, and when he was obligated to the existence of his own, he was the right to the right to all, and then what was influenced in others is either that he is the one who is influenced by And the positive, or to be influential on the path of the verb and the choice, there is no crime that removed the illusion of its being influenced by the high and the positive saying: (P-5) The act is, so he said: (The neighborhood) indicated that he was a leading scholar, and his saying: (Al-Qayyum) indicated that he is based on his self, and what is the same, These are the two of the two of the two issues that are considered in the knowledge of the neutrality.He first: that one is required for one of the existence, in the sense that his essence is not compounds from the parts.And his proof is that every cruise is a lack of its achievement to the achievement of every one of its parts, and its part is otherwise, and it is all of it.And the one who is upright, without it, is not a perception of it, so it is not a valid, and it is clear with the proof that it is valid, and if it is proven that it is the same, then it is the same.One of them: that the obligation of the existence is one, in the sense that there are no one of them in the presence of one of them, and it is obligatory for them The polytheism is not what it has, so it is necessary for each one of them in itself, compounded by part, and we have shown us that it is referred.The second is that when he was prevented in his right to be a compound from the part of the one who prevented his being biased; Because every bias is divided, and it has been proven that the installation of it is forbidden.Because there is no meaning for the perpetrator, except for what can refer to a sensual signal, and if it is proven that it is not a bias and is not in the side, it is not possible.And the second: that when it was a valid, it was based on the same, and it is a standing person, who is obligated by things: the first obligatory: that it is not a presentation in the place Originally a place; Because the situation is limited to the place, and the lack of others is not valid.The second is the second: some scholars said: There is no meaning for knowledge except the presence of the fact of the knowledge of the scientist, so if it is valid in the sense of his saying, there is no one who does not say it.His truth is present with itself, and if there is no meaning for knowledge except this presence, then his truth must be known to his self, so the same is the same It is promised that he is affected by his influence In the sense of his being based on others, and that effect, if he is the choice, the choice is the choice, and it must have a feeling of what is wrong with him He is a scholar of all other things; Because itself is due to all of what it has, and we have indicated that he is obligated from his being, based on the soul for his own as a scholar of the same, and the knowledge of the knowledge With the highest, all of them are all necessary, as it is a valid, as it is a scholar of all information.And the third of it: when it was a valid for all of what it was, all that it had happened; Because its effect in the evaluation of that is not possible for it to be the case of the meeting of that other than that; Because you obtain the habit of a referral, it is either the state of its numbers, or the state of its resurrection, and on the two estimates, it must be all modern.And its elevation: that when it was a valid for all the possibilities, all the possibilities were given to it, either by means or by others, and on the two estimates, the two of the people were the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: We have concluded it and made it clear in this book in many verses, so if you help you with the success and contemplated this handicapped that we have mentioned, I have noted that you have noted that we have noted that we have noted that we did not know.Among the issues related to the divine knowledge is only by the mediation of it, as it is a lively lively living, so there is no generosity that the greatest name is, this is this, As his saying: And your God is one God, and there is no god but He [Al-Qar: 163] and his saying, God is the testimony that he (P-6) is not God except he is [Al-Amran: 18] The denial of the opposite and the peer, and the saying of it is one of the people of God, in the sense of the exile of the opposite and the peer, and in the sense that its truth is the right of the His saying is that your Lord, God who created the heavens and the earth [Al -Araf: 54] Fifth in the two description of the grapes of the gratitude It indicates all; Because it is a valid, it is necessary for it to be a standing person, and that it is based on others, and its existence is based on the same one that requires the same Its truth, and that requires the unit in the sense of the exile of the opposite and the peer, and the exile requires the bias, and by its midst, it requires the negation of the side.It is also a valid in the sense of his being, who is based on others.And the end of the sentences and causes of it, and that requires saying the judiciary and destiny, so it appeared that these two people are like those who are grateful, so the one who is the same This verse was attained in the honor to the Aqsaqqq Al -Aqsa, and it is obligatory to be the great name of God Almighty.Then it is the Almighty when he showed that it is a living alive This is confirmed by his saying that it is not taken by a year and no sleep for him and the meaning: that he does not overlook the manipulation of creation, because the guardian of the command of the ritual is the same The ritual, for the sake of all the events, and the values ​​of the possibilities, cannot be forgiven by their mobilization, so it is not overlooked, so it is not said that it is not.As for sure of the exalted, the exalted, and it is as it is said to those who were lost and the most important: You are a sleeping teeth, then it is the Almighty when it is clear.Self, based on others, he arranged a judgment on him and he said: He has what is in the heavens and what is in the land because it was not all otherwise, but it is stood up And his provision of his evaluation, his formation and his creation, it is necessary for everything that it will be a king for him and his king, and he is what is meant by the saying of what is in his saying: It is proven that he is the king and the king for all of what it is, it is proven that his judgment in every neighbor is not a neighbor in something of the judgment, except with his permission, and his command, and he is the one who does not He intercede for him except with his permission, then when he indicated that he is obligated to be a money for all of him, that he will not be for him in the king of his king, who will be shrouded It is necessary for him to be a scholar of all and otherwise, other than that of all, that it is not for him to be in his king, he will be shown by his face, and he is the one who is in his face, He knows what is between their hands and what they have left, and it is a sign of his color, they are aware of all of them, then he said: And they do not surround anything from his knowledge, and he is a sign of his knowledge, and he is a sign of a good thing The information is, then it is clear as the king of his king The two who are delusional and cut off without the prospects to the lowest degree of its degrees, the imaginations of the imagination, so he said: His chairs expanded the heavens and the earth, then the one who has been And his king in every one of the one, and one image, and he said: They do not want them to keep them, then when it is clear in the sense of the meaning And the creatures, showing it a valid meaning of itself and itself, is a balance from the need to need it other than the affairs, so it is a matter A place, or a changed until he needs a time, so he said: It is the great, the most prominent of it is the high and the greatness, in the sense that he does not need anything other than it In a characteristic of the adjectives, nor in a refusal of the enemies, he said: It is the great, referring to what he started in the verse from his virtue, in the sense of his meaning.And who surrounded his mind with what we mentioned He knew that it is not with the human minds of divine matters as a complete words and no proof, which clarified what these verses were seen.* * * (P-7) If you know these secrets, let us return to the appearance of interpretation.As for his saying: God has no god but he is in his two questions: the first question: (God) was raised with the appetite, and after his news.The second question: Some of them said: God is the servant.It is a mistake for Jahin: The first: that he was a deity in the eternal, and he was not idle.The second: It is the highest of the servants of the Qur’an in the Qur’an with his saying: You and what you worship without God [the Prophet: 98], but God is the one who is the one who did it.For worship.As for his saying: (alive), he has questions: the first question: alive, originally alive, as his saying: warning and fatigue, so the ya was tickled in the yaa, and he said: Al -Anbari: Its origin is alive.The second question: The speakers said: The neighborhood is all that is true that he knows and appreciates, and they were dispersed that this concept is a description that is a ritual, and he said: On the authority of the thing, in which it is not forbidden that he knows and appreciates, and the abuse is not a row, and the investigators said: And what was the one who was The abstinence, and it has been proven that the abstinence is a long thing, as if it was a description of the stretching, it would be described by it.The abstinence is a number, and it has proven that life is the abode of this abstinence, and it has proven that the numbers of the numbers are equipped, and it is necessary that the concept of life be a row.The third question: for a saying that he says: When the meaning of the live is that it is true to know and be able, and this destiny is for all the tallness, so that it is a good time God himself with a description that he shared in it the brother of the tales?And who has in this section that alive in the origin of the language is not a phrase of this health, but everything was complete in his gender, for he is called alive, not to see that he is not.It is called: the neighborhood of the dead, and the Almighty said: So look at the traces of the mercy of God, how to revive the earth after its death [Al -Rum: 50] and he said: To a country dead, then he will live with us.The name is in the knowledge of the speakers, but it was called life; Because as the body of the body is that it is described in that adjective, then this row is called a life; And as the state of the trees is that it is a green purpose, so this situation is called a life, and the land is the land that it will be a mourning, so there is no crime, so it is the case.The original concept is from the memorization of alive, as it is located on the most complete of its conditions and attributes, and if it is Likewise, the forms were removed; Because the concept is alive is the whole, and when it was not restricted to it, it is complete in this without that indicating that it is complete on the launch, so he said: Launching, and the whole is that it is not subject to a none, neither in itself nor in his true attributes, nor in his relative and additional attributes, then this is if we are in this way.To evaluate otherwise, forms are still formed; Because his being is a reason for the evaluation of others, it is indicated by his being, and it is a valid, and it is a valid that indicates that it is a valid for it A name indicates that he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a good and a good, so that this is the same, so that this is the same, so what is this And God knows.“ Tight, and it is not permissible to be a verb; Because if it was such, he would have been a force, and there are three languages ​​in it: values, values, and values, and it is narrated from Omar, may God be pleased with him, that he has read: alive.Among the people who said: This is a transcendent, not Arabic, because they say: a live alive.And the matter is not like that, because we have indicated that he has a correct face in the language, and the like: there is no house, a dreamer and a circle, and it is from the dour And he goes, and the illiteracy of the son of Abi Al -Salat said: The second one who is the second question is: Something, and his interpretation that it is a person with the mobilization of the matter of creation in finding them, and in their livelihoods, and his counterpart from the verses is the saying of God: [Al -Ra`da: 33] And he said: God witnessed that there is no god but He [Al -Amran: 18] to his saying, based on the pretext [Al -Amran: 18] and he said: God is the same They are still holding them from one of him [Fateer: 41] and this saying refers to his habit to his being, who is based on others, and the laughter said: It is forbidden for him to change, and I say: This saying is returned with its meaning to his being, based on itself in itself and in its existence, and he said: With the secret, and this saying is distant; Because he becomes his saying: Do not take him a year or sleep.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Do not take it as a year or sleep, and it has questions: the first question: “Sunnah” what is presented from the brokenness that is called the name.If it is said: If the Sunnah is a phrase for the oldest of the sleep, then if he says: Do not take it for a year, then this is indicated that it is not It is taken as a sleep with the first part of the first, and the remembrance of the sleep was a disturbance.We said: The estimation of the verse: Do not take it as a year, as the sleep is taken by the sleep.The second question: the mental evidence indicated that the sleep, the east and the negligence are deals with God Almighty; Because these things are either, either are expressions of knowledge of knowledge, or from the addition of knowledge, and on the two estimates, so it is a way that it is necessary for the sake of the knowledge of God.It was the same as the same, in which it is correct to be a scholar, and it is correct that it is not a scholar, so it is permissible to obtain the attribute of the knowledge of it to the verb.Single is referred, so it is imperative that it is ended with whom his knowledge is a row and the affliction of the domestication is the abuse of the demise, and if it is like that, the sleep and the flame and the flame.The third question: It is narrated from the Messenger ﷺ that he narrated from Moses, peace be upon him, that he signed in himself: Is God sleeping, or not?Then he gave him two parts in every one hand, and commanded him to keep them, and he was embarrassed by his effort until he slept at the end of the matter, so he was chosen, so he was so and so he was so and so he was so and so he was.So God, the Exalted, is the same as for him in Bayan, that if he would sleep, he would not be able to keep the heavens and the earth.(P-9) Know that the example of this cannot be attributed to Moses, peace be upon him.To Moses, but if the novel is authenticated, then this question is to be the question of this question to the ignorance of his people.As for the saying of the Almighty: He has what is in the heavens and what is in the land, so what is meant by this addition is the addition of creation and the king, and its estimation is what we mentioned that what was the duty The existence of itself, and every place that has a influence, and everything that has influenced, is an event, so all other things are, then it is an event with its events, so it is a creator, so it is a creator, so it is a creator, so it is a creator, so it is a creator, so it is a creator, so it is a creator, so it is Add the king's addition and creation.If it was said: Why did he say: He has what is in the heavens, and he did not say: He has someone in the heavens?.We said: When what was meant was adding what he had to do with the creature, and the majority of it was inconceivable, the majority of the course of all, so he passed away from it.It was attributed to it from where it is a creature, and it is from where it is a creature that is not sane, so he expressed it with the word “what” is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the guarantee that the guarantee is that From this side.And he knew that the companions have taken this verse that the actions of worshipers are created for God Almighty, they said: Because he said: He has what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and what is in the earth, And the act of worshipers from a sentence in the heavens and the earth, so it must be seduced to God The property and creation are affiliated, and as the memorizer indicates this meaning, the mind is certain, and that is because all that it has is, it is possible for it, and it is not possible, and it is not possible, and it is not possible for it to be.With the effects of the existence of the existence of itself, otherwise it is necessary to likely to be likely to be likely to be impossible.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: Who is the one who intercede for him except with his permission, and he has two questions: He intercede for him only with his command, and so that the participants were claiming that the idols intercede for them, and God has told them to say that they are not.To God, Zifi [Al -Zamer: 3] and their saying: These are our lips with God [Yunus: 18] Then he explained that they are not found this aspiration, so he said: He will harm them and do not benefit them [Yunus: 18] So God Almighty told that there is no intercession for him for anyone, except for those whom God exalted be exalted with his saying: except for his saying: The day of the spirit and angels rises a class that does not speak except for those who authorize the Most Merciful and said right [Al -Nabaa: 38].The second question: Al -Qafal said: It is an infringement that does not authorize the reaction to the other people, as it was not permissible in his ruling on the level of the people of the family, and the family of the good Its report.And I say: This lock is a great desire for the retreating the good of the belief in their words, and with that, it was a little surrounded by their origins, and that The Basrin among them is that the pardon of the great owner is good in the minds, except that the hearing indicates that this does not fall, and if the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the mind The disobedience is a mistake on their saying, but rather on the way of the captivity that the pardon of the tinkers is a mind, and if the lock is on (p-10), the vagina, then This recitation is evaluated, except that the answer to it is returned from the faces: the first: that the punishment is the right of God, and it is worthy of the right to fall.It is the right of the servant, so it is not for God to drop it, and this difference was mentioned by the Basris in the answer to the suspicion of the captain.The second: that his saying: It is not permissible to settle between the obedience and the disobedient if he wants it that it is not permissible to settle between them in a matter of things, so it is ignorant; Because he is the Almighty, he has settled between them in creation, life, livelihood, and feeding the good women and those who are from the wills, and if what is meant is that it is not permissible to settle in all of them, then they will be among them.With it, how does it not say that and the obedient does not have a reward, and it is not a disagreement from the punishment, and the sinner will be in the end of the fear, and maybe the fire A period, then God will be saved Come on for that torment by the ritual of the Messenger ﷺ.And he knew that the lock - may God have mercy on him - was the good of the words in interpretation, the narration of the view of the interpretations of the righteousness, but it was the greatness It was a little luck from the science of words, a little of the share, from the knowledge of the words of the dismissed.* * * As for his words, the Almighty is: He knows what is between their hands and what they left in his two questions: The first question: The owner of the scout said: The guilt is what is in the heavens; Because there are the minds, or when it is indicated by “who” of the angels and the prophets.The second question: In the verse, it is one: one of them: he said Mujahid, giving, and Al -Saddi: What is between their hands was what was before them of the worlds of the world and what they left behind.The second: Al -Dahhak and Al -Kalbi said: He knows what is between their hands, meaning the hereafter because they are presented to it and what the world has left them because they are behind them.The third: Ata said about Ibn Abbas who knows what is between their hands from the sky to the earth and what their successor wants what is in the heavens.And the four: He knows what is between their hands after their deadlines were fulfilled and what left them, that is: what was before he created them.And the fifth: What they did of good and evil and what they do after that.He knew that the intended from these words: that he is a scholar of the shawl and the coded for him, while he is attached to the investigation of punishment and the reward, because he is a matter He has a hidden, and the luxury do not know from themselves that they have obedience to what they deserve, this is the great house of God, and God does not know.They have in that intercession, and that they deserve the time and the dirt on that, and this indicates that it is not one of the caliphs to be presented to the reaction.The third question: These are the ones who are mentioned in this verse, it is required that they are the angels, and the man who intercede on the day of the resurrection of the Prophets and the two of the Prophets And the righteous.* * * As for his saying: They do not surround anything of his knowledge, and he has books: The first question: What is meant by knowledge is the knowledge of us, as it is said: O God Your information; And if a great verse appears, it is said: This is the power of God, that is: His ability, and the meaning: that one does not surround the information of God Almighty.(P-11) The second question: some of the companions were brought in this verse in the proof of the characteristic of the knowledge of God Almighty, and it is weak for its faces: one of them: that the word is from the word.On the science, if if it was intended from the science the same adjective, he would have entered the menstruation in the attribute of God Almighty and he is referred.The second: that he said what he wants, he does not come in knowledge, but he comes in the knowledge.The third: that The words are only in the information, and what is meant is that it is a scholar of all the information, and the creation does not know all the information, but they only know from it.The third question: Al -Laith said: It is said to everyone who has been holed up or his knowledge of his knowledge: He has surrounded him, and that is because he knows what he knows and is the first Knowledge is like surrounding it.As for his saying: Unless he wants, he said: One of them: that they do not know anything of its information, except what he wants is that he teaches them as he told them that they have not said: [Al -Baqara: 32].And the second: that they do not know the absence except when God has briefed some of his prophets on some of the unseen, as he said: He does not appear on one of his absences, from the one who is one of the one who is one of the ones.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: His chairs expanded the heavens and the earth, so know that it is said: He expanded, so let the things be able to capture it, if it is bound by it, and it is not for it, and it is not.It is tolerated and does not bear it, and it is his saying to him, peace be upon him: “If Moses was alive, he could only follow me.The thing is perfect for some, and the marsal is the doors of the animals and its poems, and it will be overlooked at each Some of it on one another, and the lament of the thing if it is installed, and from it the chaos to install some of its parts on each other.Some of them are some.And those who were disturbed by four sayings: The first: It is a great body that expands the heavens and the earth, and then they disagreed with it, and the good said: The secret may be described as a throne, and that he is a chair, to be every one of them, where he is correct to be able They disagreed, and for those who said: It is without the throne and above the seven heaven, and others said: It is under the ground while it is transmitted from the sixth.And he knew that the Karsi’s memorization and a response in the verse came in the correct news that it is a great body under the throne and above the heavenly sky, and there is no abuse in the saying, By following it, and as for what was narrated from Saeed ibn Jabir on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, he said: He is the place The feet of God Almighty and sanctify the wounds and the members, and we mentioned the many indications of the denial of the body in the positions of many of this book, so the book is the right of this book Or carry it that what is meant is that the chair is the position of the feet of the great spirit or the king of the greatness of the fate of God Almighty.The second saying: that what is meant by the “cordon” And the king, and then it is said: the divine is only with destiny, creation and creation, and the Arabs are called the origin of everything He is sitting on the Karsi, and the king is called the name of the king's place.(P-12) The third saying: “The Karsi” is the science, because the science is the subject of the scientist, which is the Karsi, so the characteristic of the thing is called in the name of the place of the place.Because the knowledge is the matter that is based on it, and the chair is the thing that is used on it, and from it it is said to the scholars: my head, because they are the ones who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not do so the earth.And the righteous saying: What is the choice of the lock, which is that the intended from this speech is the perpetrator of the greatness of God and his arrogance, and his reports is that he is the one who addressed the creation of the creation in the same way They used to be in their angels and their greatness, from that he made the heels a house for him, the people flock to him, as they floated in the house of their angels, and the people of the same People are the homes of their fullness, and he mentioned in the wicked stone that God is clear in his land, then he made him a place for kissing, as he accepts the people, and the people are not.He mentioned in the accountant of
