The researcher of the Quran, the transgression of it: and kill them where you stopped them and brought them out from where they were brought out and the temptation is more severe than the killing and do not fight them when the mosque is the forbidden, so I will fight you I kill you and kill them, as well as the parties of the disbelievers, for if they are over, then God is Forgiving, Most Merciful, and in which there are questions: the first question: A steadfast man who is fasting to take his peers, said: ؎ So you stop me, so kill me, so whoever stops it, then it is not to the immortality, then we say: He said: He said: واقِعٌ عَلى النَّبِيِّ ﷺ ومَن هاجَرَ مَعَهُ وإنْ كانَ الغَرَضُ بِهِ لازِمًا لِكُلِّ مُؤْمِنٍ, والضَّمِيرُ في قَوْلِهِ: واقْتُلُوهُمْ عائِدٌ إلى الَّذِينَ أمَرَ بِقَتْلِهِمْ في الآيَةِ الأُولى وهُمُ الكُفّارُ From the people of Makkah, then God commanded the Almighty to kill them where they were in the solution and the forbidden, and in the month of the forbidden, and the words are fulfilled that it is the highest of the righteousness in the righteousness The fighting, and in this more in the depression, he commanded the strictness with them whether they were dead or did not fight, and the fighting was broken from him when the mosque is forbidden.The second question: It was transmitted from a fighter that he said: The verse presented to this verse, and it is his saying: They fought in (p-111), the path of God who is the one who fights [190] Humanity with his saying: Do not fight them at the mosque, the forbidden, then that verse is a texture with his words, the Almighty: and fight them until you do not weak.As for his saying: His saying is the Almighty: and fight in the path of God who fight you with the texture of this verse, so it is presented to you, and the one who says: Humanity with his saying: Do not fight them at the mosque, the forbidden, so this is a matter of specialization, not from the door of transcription, and as for his saying: Do not fight them with the mosque With his saying: And they fought them until it is not a temptation, as it is a mistake as well because it is not permissible to feed in the fighting in the sanctuary, and this judgment is what is copying it, but it is the rest, but it is the rest, but it is the rest, but it is the rest.It was proven that his saying is weak, and because he is a wise person to collect between the righteous verses that are every one of them is a dirt for the last.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: And they brought them out from where they were brought out, and he has been in his life: the first search: that the lattraj bears and faces: one of them: The second: that they were seduced in their fear and tightening the matter to them, until they became obliged to al -Kharj.The second research: that the form of “where“ they are enticed and voices: one of them: they brought them out of the position that brought you out and it is Mecca.The second: Remove them from your homes.If you know this, then we say: God is the Almighty, the believers that they come out of those who are infidels from the Mecca, if they reside on their parts, if you can, for it, then they are from it.They can be able to do so, and this reason The Messenger of God is evident ﷺ every partner of the sanctuary, then they also made them any of the city, and peace and blessings be upon him said: * * * As for his saying, the Almighty is more severe than the killing, in his faces: one of her: it is a man who is transmitted from Ibn Abbas: that what is meant by the temptation is the disbeliever In the temptation, because it is a corruption in the earth that leads to darkness and exodus, and in it the temptation, but it made the infidels a greatest of killing, because the disbelievers are the sin of the sinner The sustainable, the killing is not like that, and the infidelity comes out of it from the nation, and the killing is not like that, so the disbelief was greater than the killing, and the narration of the heart, That some of the companions was killed by a man from the infidels in the month of the forbidden, so the believers are their games on that, so God Almighty revealed this to the verse, so the meaning is that it is not.Condition for killing in the month of the forbidden, for the infidels on the infidels in the month of the forbidden month is greater than that.And the second: that the temptation originally is the offer of gold on the fire to take it out of cheating, then it became a name for all that was a reason for the two of the two people, and the meaning of this On the infidels and on the eagerness of the believers, and to tighten the matter to them, in which they became refugees to the leaving of the people and the homosexuality, with the absence From what they fear and warn, a severe temptation, but it is more severe than the killing that requires disturbing from the dignity and pests A reward for you is not for you.The third face: that the intended temptation is the permanent torment that is obligated by their disbelief, as if it was said: kill them from the time of you The torment of God is more severe than him as his saying: We are waiting for you to afflict you with a torment from him [Tawbah: 52] and release the name of the temptation (p-112) The name of the cause is on the cause.The believers and the believers [Al -Buruj: 10], that is, tortured them, and said: If he is in God, he will make the temptation of people like the torment of God [Al -Ankabut: 10], that is, their torment.The loud face: that the intended is that you will be in your way from the forbidden mosque, it is more severe than killing you in the sanctuary, because they can help in preventing You did not create gin and humanity except for it.Fifth face: that the believer's increased is more severe than to kill a later, and the meaning: and bring them out from where they are brought out, and if you come to you, then you will come to you, for you, for you, for you The truth was that of you, and I would make you easier for you to renew your religion or to be lazy in obedience to your Lord.* * * As for his saying: Do not fight them when the mosque is the forbidden until they fight you in it in his two issues: the first question: this is a way for the meeting of this condition in this condition.The seat is private, and it was before the condition in all the fighting and in the most sacred.The second question: Read Hamza and Al -Kisa’i: (Do not kill them until they kill you, for if they kill you) all of them are all thousands of thousand A thousand, but it was written as well as for brevity, as it was written: The Most Merciful is a thousand, and so: Fear, and the likeness of that is the extent of the extension and the one who said: The two peoples, if the work does not contradict the work, it is necessary to do with them, as it is done with the two verses if the work is not incapable Doing them when the copy is not in it.It is narrated that Al -Amash said to Hamza: I saw your readers if the man becomes mortgaged.Hamza said: The Arabs, if a man was killed by them, said that we were killed, and if a man was crushed from them, they said, we were guilty.* * * The third question: Hanafi, they are held with this verse in the question of the resort to the sanctuary, and they said: When the killing is not permissible at the mosque, the mosque is permissible for the sake of the mosque.The infidelity, because the murder is not permissible in the mosque in the forbidden by the sins that is without the disbelief, it was the first, and the blame of the words in it in the books of disagreement.As for his words, the Almighty: If they are ended, then God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.It is still, even if they ended up and repented as it was proven in a lot of limits that the repentance does not remove it, so he said: "Then, it was obligatory to kill them: for God, then it is for them to be.A merciful indicated that they were when they ended up with that, the killing of the killing of them, and his counterpart, said: Say to those who disbelieve if they disbelieve if they disbelieve if they are disbelieved.[Anfal: 38].* * * And in the verse: the first question: Ibn Abbas said: If they are over from the fighting, and Al -Hassan said: If they are over from the evil.The Hajj is the first saying: that the intended from the authorization in the fighting is to prevent the infidels from the fighting, so it was his saying: if they ended up the one who was blessed.The pilgrimage of the second saying: that the infidel does not attain the forgiveness of God and his mercy by blessing the fighting, but by blessing the infidels.(P-113) The two testimonies appeared: It is forbidden to infidelity, but that it affects In the blood of blood only.As for the one who affects the investigation of reward, forgiveness, and prohibition, it is only what we mentioned.The third question: the verse indicated that the repentance is from all the acceptance of an acceptance, and the saying of those who said: The repentance of the killing of the baptism is not the same.From the killing, if God accepts the repentance of the infidel, then the acceptance of the kinship is the first, and also, then the infidel may be in terms of collection with it, with the unbelief of it.The verse on the acceptance of the repentance of every disbeliever is indicated that his repentance is if it is a kinship acceptable, and God knows.
