The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: He will pray a fire with a flame in which there are questions.The first question: When he was told about the condition of my father, a flame in the past by the door, and that he is not richer than his money and his gain, tell him about his condition.The second question: (he will pray) Read with the opening of the ya and its shedding is reduced and tight.The third question: These verses include the news from the absence of three of the faces: one of them: the lobby of it by the door and the loss, and it was like that.And the second: The luxury of it is the intensity of his work with his affliction and his child, and he was like that, the father of a mortal (P-157) narrated the birth of the Messenger of God ï·º He said: I was a boy The demanded and Islam entered our house, so the servants became Muslim and converted to the mother of the best and I became Muslim, and the servants were afraid of the people and the conquest of his Islam, and the father of the father was He sent his place Al -Aas bin Hicham, and a man of them did not succeed except that his place sent another man, and when the news came from the death of the people of Badr and we found it, and we found it in I was weak and I was doing the salt in the stone of Zamzam, so I was sitting there and when the mother of the best is sitting sitting, and we have been pleased with what we came from the news if he accepted the father of the father.His legs, he sat on the wiping of the stone and was my back to his back, and between us is sitting when the people said: This is Abu Sufyan ibn al -Harith ibn Abd al -Mutla How to tell my nephew?And he said: We met the people and we gave them to us.On me, he struck me, and I was a weak man, so the mother of the best of the pioneer was a baptism, and he struck him with his head and shivered him, and she said: I will weaken him We have believers for many days, and he believed that he said: So he spent humiliation, and God did not live except for seven for the nights until God threw him with the end of God His father left him for two or three or three things that he buried until I was in his house, and Qarish was a longing and its enemy, as the people of the plague fear, and they said, and they said, Then they buried him and left him, so this is the meaning of his saying: What is the richest of his money and what he has.And the third of it: the news that it is one of the people of the fire, and it was like that, because it died on the infidels.The following question: The people of the Sunnah began on the incidence of the unbearable of what is unable He told him that he does not believe and that he is one of the people of the fire, so he has become a cost that he believes that he is not believed, and this is the same as a group between the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has been Al -Basri that if the father believed in a flame, it would have been for this news.He believed, not that he did not believe, and the judge answered him and said: When was it said if God did what he told that he does not do it, so how would it be?Our answers: that the answer is not valid for that without or yes.Know that these two answers are in the end of the stroke.As for the first: because this verse is indicative of the fact that God has told about his faith and signed, and the sincerity of the sincerity of his faith contradicts him and the existence of faith is a self -fulfillment.It was a case that he came with faith with the existence of this news, so he assigned him to collect among the two opponents.As for the second answer, it was left from the first; Because we are in a request that they remember their tongue, not or yes, but the mind of the mind witnessed that between the one who is the one who is faithful, and the faith of the faith, and the faith of the faith, and the faith of the faith, and the faith of the faith It was the case with the establishment of one of the opposites in the event of the other to collect the collection between the two opposites, and this forms are the same, whether it is a male of the one who is the one who is the one who is the same.He kept silent.
