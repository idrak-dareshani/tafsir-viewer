The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: And when we said to the angels, they found for the Adam, so they would be prostrated except the Plice of my father and the arrogance, and it was from the disbelievers.All human beings, which is that it was their pneumators and the Almighty made our father the prostitute of angels; That is because he is the highest of the dedication of Adam with the difference first and then specializing in many knowledge secondly, then his justification in the knowledge until the angels became soaked It was taught in knowledge, and now he mentioned it as a prostration of the angels, and here are the questions: the first question: the matter of the prostration, the one who has been done before God Peace be upon him, with the evidence of his saying: I am a good man from clay, so if I settle it and I am blowing in it from my soul, then they will fall for him, prostrating to him [p.71, 72] It is peace be upon him, when he became alive, he became a prostitute.Because the fulfillment in his saying: (So they fall) to the punishment, and on this estimation, the knowledge of the names and its debate with the angels is in that, in which there is a matter The angels.* * * The second question: the Muslims are collected that that prostration is not prostrating worship; Because the prostration of worship for the other is disbelieving and the matter does not respond to the disbelief, then they disappeared after that on three sayings: the first: that the prostration of the prostration was for the sake It was like a kiss, and among the people who stabbed in this saying from two faces: The first: that I did not say to the kiss, but it is said that I prayed to the kiss, so if it was the one who was the same For that prostration, it is obligatory to say that they would be prostrated to Adam, so when he did not want the matter like this, but it was said: They found that we know that the Adam was upon him.The second: that Absis said: I saw you, this who honored me, that is, that it is a prostration that indicates that it is greater than the prostration, and if it was a kiss, it was not like it Dragha, with a sign that Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was praying to the kaaba, and it was not necessary that the kaeh would be better than Muhammad.The answer to the first is that it is not permissible to say: I prayed until the kiss, it is permissible for me to be said to the kiss and the evidence (P-195), the Qur’an and the poet, the Qur’an, Exalted: Fake the prayer for the sun of the sun [Al -Asra: 78] and the prayer for God is not for your children, so if it is permissible for that, then it is not permissible for me to say that the prayer is not for the prayer For kiss?As for the poetry, Hasan said: ؎ I know that the matter is a departure from Hashem, then from it on the authority of Abu Hosan, the first of those who prayed to you.With the Qur’an and Sunnah?So he said to my kiss, a text on the intended, and the answer to the second is that the Episis complained of his crime, and that is the crime that we do not accept With the exaggeration of that prostration, but perhaps he would have obtained that with other things that are other things, so this is what is in the first saying, but the second saying is that the prostration was the prostration of peace He glorified him and greets him as peace be upon him, and the righteous nations have done so that the Muslims revive some of them, and some of them said: And they mimic for him prostrating [Yusuf: 100] The people greeted people, then some of them were prostrated for some.On the authority of Saheb, “I am forbidden when he came from the Yemeni, he glorified the Prophet ﷺ He said:“ Oh, forbidden, what is this?He said: The Jews prostrate to its greatness and its scholars, and I saw the Christians prostrating to its sake and its heat.I said: What is this?They said: The greeting of the prophets, so peace be upon him, they lied to their prophets.And on the authority of Al -Thawri on the authority of Samak ibn Hani, he said: He entered Al -Jatheeq on Ali ibn Abi Taleb, so he wanted to prostrate to him, and he said to him: “Glory be to him.” And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “If I had commanded anyone to prostrate to others, I would have commanded the woman to find her husband to grow his right to her.” The third saying: that the prostration in the origin of the language is the purity and the subjugation.Emoking, and from it the saying of the Almighty: The Najam and the tree are prostrating [Rahman: 6] and know that the first saying is weak; Because the intended of this story is the explanation of the greatest of Adam, peace be upon him.Because the prostration does not doubt that it is in the knowledge of the law, a phrase on the authority of the forehead on the ground, so it is obligatory to be in the origin of the language, so that the origin is that the origin is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the origin of the The prostration is worship and worship for the other than God, it is not permissible.One of us is the one who benefits from what is beneficial to the saying, and that is only for the return, and if it is proven that it is not possible for it to be in some of the halls of the stipulation of the human being on the one It is useful with it, and it is not a worship, and if it is not a servant, and if it is also not to be able to worship God, the angels are in this way.* * * The third question: They disagreed that the Ebis was from the angels?Some of the speakers said, nor in particular the disgraced, that he was not from them, and many of the jurisprudence said: He was one of them and the first was brought up with his wings: one of them: It will be from the angels, but we said that it was from the jinn because it was said in the surah of the cave, except for a Plice, which was from the jinn [Al -Kahf: 50] (P-196) Jinn must not be of angels; Because the gin is a man who is contrary to the king, and this is weak because the jinn is taken from the two gossip, and it is the one.And for this, the gin is called a gin for its voices, and it is the paradise for its being a curtain, and the paradise is for its formation of the branches, and it is the one who is the madness, and the paradise is the one who is the garden This is proven and the angels are taken away from the eyes, and it is necessary to release Jinn on them according to the language, so it was proven that this destiny does not benefit the That Pliess was from the jinn, it was not necessary for the angels to say that the Almighty said: One day, all of them will be gathered, then he says to the angels, the people of you.And among them without them, but they worshiped the jinn [Saya: 41], and this verse is clear in the difference between heaven and king, for if it was said: We are not a peace that he was from the jinn.From heaven [Al -Kahf: 50], so it is not permissible for the meant to be from paradise on what was narrated from Ibn Masoud that he said: He was from the jinn, that is, the treasurer of the paradise?We greeted us, but it is not permissible for him to say: from Heaven, that is, he became from heaven, as he said, and he was from the infidels, that is, it became from the infidels, that he is the one who is unbeliever From heaven, why did you say that his being from heat contradicts what is from the angels?And what you mentioned of the verse is opposed to another verse, which is the saying of the Almighty and made between it and between the paradise a lineage [Al -Saffat: 158] and that is because the Quraysh said: The verse indicates that the king is called a jinn?The answer: It is not permissible for what is meant by his saying: It was from the jinn [Al -Kahf: 50] that he was the treasurer of Paradise; Because his saying: Except Ebis, he was from heat, who felt that he left it for the prostration of his being a garden, and it is not possible to leaving the prostration of the prostration, So that his saying is invalidated: it was from the jinn, that is, it became from the jinn.We said: This is the disagreement of the phenomenon, so it is not for him except with the harm, and as for his saying, they are exalted and made between him and between paradise au to the lineage [Al -Saffat: 158] That attributed to the proportions in the jinn, as it has proven it in the angels, and also, it was clear that the king is called Jinn with the basis of the origin of the language, but it is not the same.Without them, as he has noticed the bear, even if it is according to the original language, all that is bent, but it is according to the knowledge of the sake of what is the same, so it is the same.On the original language, and the verse that we mentioned on the same norm.And the second: that the Ebeis has an offspring and the angels, not the offspring of them, but we said: The Ebeisis has an offspring for his saying, in his class, and he took his grace.Careful from my debt [Al -Kahf: 50], and this is clear in the proof The offspring of it, but our saying: The angels are not the offspring of them; Because the offspring is obtained from the male and the female, and the angels are not a female, in which they say it, and they made the angels who are the servants of the mercy.Their testimony will be written [Al -Zakarf: 19] that those who judge them are denied by the pollution.And the third of it: that the angels are informed of what his bid came, and I am not like that, so it was not necessary to be from the angels.And the one who is seen: that the Pliss is a creature from the fire and the angels.[Al -Araf: 12] Over it was because he was from heaven because of his saying that was from heaven [Cave: 50] and Heaven are created from the fire because of his saying, and the committees were from the fire of the fire from the fire.[Al -Hijar: 27] And the human creation said from Salawal, such as the fool, and the creation of the elves from a fire from fire [Al -Rahman: 15].Lake on the authority of Aisha from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said, “P-197) the angels of light and the creation of the elves from a fire”; Because it is one of the most famous that the angels are spirituality, and it was said that they were called with that; Because they were created from the wind or the wind.Fifth: The angels are a messenger for his saying, the Almighty, the angels are a messenger [a pier: 1] and the messengers of God are infallible, for the saying of God, may God bless him [Al -Anam: 124] When he was not like, so it was not necessary to be from the angels, and those who say that they were from the angels were brought up with two things.The first: that God is exalted, the angels of the angels and the discretion, it benefits the departure of what his children are to enter or correct his entry, and that is required of the olive The discontent is a famous in the words of the Arabs.They hear in it a lukewarm and do not be a sinner except a peaceful peace [Al -Waqihah: 25] and he said: Do not eat your money between you with falsehood, except that you are a merchant: 29] There is no believer to kill a believer except a mistake [Al -Nasa: 92] and also because he was a single garden among the thousand I exceeded me, one of them is one of them; Because we say: Each one of these two directions is on the behalf of the original, so that is, but it is to him at the forefront, and the evidence that you mentioned in the nose of the There is nothing but the accommodation on the generalities, so if we made it from the angels, it would be necessary The specialization of what you have relied upon from the world, and if we said: It is not from the angels, we have to carry the sacrifice of the discretion on the other The generalities are more in the book of God, the Hands of the Hands of the Excellence on the Cut Performance, so our saying was the first.Also, the discretion is derived from the fold and the script, and the meaning of the flag is, but it will be fulfilled where if it were not for the sake of the way to enter and the thing does not enter into it.The meaning of the discretion is achieved in it, and as for its saying, it is one of the angels between the angels, so we say: It is permissible to conduct the ruling of the many, if the ruling is the righteous, if it is the ruling on The lesson is not wrapped in it if the hadith is not only for that one, and it is not permissible to conduct a judgment other than it.The second pilgrimage: They said if there was no Plice of the angels, because he said, and when we said to the angels, they would find a long time, and it is not for him.It is impossible for you to leave it for the prostration of fathers, altar and disobedience, and when he deserved to be deferred and punished, and when these things are not known, we know that there is no This speech is informed unless it is from the angels, it is not said that it is not from the angels, except that he grew up with them and its mixture is with them, and it is for them to be.This speech is informed, and it is also not permissible to say: If he does not enter this matter, but God Almighty has commanded him with the prostration of what he said in the authority of what he said.His saying: It is not forbidden for you not to prostrate when I commanded you [Al -Arif: 12] because we say: As for the first, his answer is that the mixture does not require what you mentioned, and that is what we have said, and that is what we have said.The discourse of the male is not the female, and in the opposite of the intensity of the mixture between the two classifications, and also the intensity of the mixture between the angels and between the angels and between the one who is not Inside the curse on a crystal, so how to prevent the confirmation of that cost to the angels.He mentioned his saying: Father and arrogantly arrogant his saying, and when we said to the angels, they found to the Adam, I feel this punishment that this is the reason for this In the interest of another matter, this is what I have in the two sides, and God knows the truth of things.* * * (P-198) The following question: Know that a group of our companions takes the command of God Almighty to the kingdom We saw that we remember this question, so we say: The most people of the Sunnah said: The prophet is better than the angels, and you said the righteous, but it is the one who is good The saying of the Shiites, and this saying the choice of the judge, Abu Bakr al -Baqlani Among the speakers of us, and Abu Abdullah al -Halimi from our jurisprudence and we remember the hall of the words from the two sides: but those who say that the angels are more than the good With matters.One of it: His saying is the Almighty and whoever has it is not arrogant about his worshipers [the Prophet: 19] to his saying, they praise the night and the day, and they do not break.[20] With this verse from two faces: the first: that it is not what is meant by this one with the place of the place and the destination, for that is referred to God, but God bless you This verse was and wanted in the adjective of the angels, that this type is from the kinship and the honor is to them, not for others The one in the hereafter for the ones who believe in the last of the believers in the seat of a honesty at a farewell millions [the moon: 55].As for the world, he said to him Glory be to him, “I am broken by their hearts for me.Because this hadith indicates that it is their pursuit of these broken hearts and what they have taken from the verse that indicates that the angels are not the same Humanity at the servant, he entered into the glorification of the slave of the servant with God Almighty.The second direction in the reasoning of the verse is that God Almighty brought up the time of their arrogance that others must not be arrogant, and if this was the good of them, if this is the best of them.If the Sultanate, if he wants to decide on his pastors, and their obedience to him, he will say: Malouk is not arrogant from my obedience, so whoever is the most important of them I obey!And in the course, it is known that this recipient is only powerful to the weak.And it is a saying that he says: There is no conflict that the angels are more powerful and destiny than the humanity, and it is sufficient in the health of the recipient of this destiny of recession, for it is the one who says: The severity of their strength and their wasting at the ends of the heavens and the earth and their security from the pyramid and the disease and the length of their customs, they do not leave the servants of a moment The end of their weakness and their fall in the speed of the conditions in the disease and the income and the types of pests are first not to repeat, for this destiny is sufficient in the health of this, and this is not in this health Getting into this meaning, but the conflict in the virtue in the sense of the many rewards, so why did you say that this reason is not correct unless the king is more In it is a sign, with the fact that the one who is destroyed to understand is what we mentioned?And the second: that they said: the worshipers of angels are more difficult than the worshipers of humanity, so you will be more rewarding than the worshipers The repetition is more severe, so their obedience will be more difficult, but we said that their money is more severe; Because the slave slave is one of the pests, who seeks to seek needs, it is a mother to the blessings and the virtue of the mourning in the needs, for it is like the one who is obligated to Its money and the access to it; And for this, the Almighty said: If they ride in the ark, they prayed to God, who have the debt, then when he escaped them to righteousness, if they share [Al -Anakbout: 65], and the knowledge of the angels, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is a millions Paradise, houses, and the positions of the ritual and the comfort, and they are safe (P-199) from the disease and poverty, then they are with the continuation of the reasons for the blessing of them, ever, since they were created.Berevishing and accompanying them as if they were imprisoned, they are not satisfied with the nakedness of the paradise and pleasures, but they are acceptable to the hard obedience, and the people of the people are not The great, as if one of the sons of Adam is unable to remain like that one day, is the best of that hurricane that is emerging and confirmed by the story of the peace He has all the positions of paradise with his saying, and each of them is a thoroughness, as it is a matter [the cow: 35] Then it is forbidden from one tree, so he did not possess his soul It indicates that their obedience is more difficult than humanity.And the second: that the cost of the cost from the type of worship to another type, such as the resignation from two bonds to two bonds, as for the residence on one type, it is the inheritance of the hardship; And for this reason, the classifications were made by the chapters and chapters, and the book of God was made by the lights, parties, the tenths, and the fifth, then the angels, then the angels of each of them On one work that does not adjust it to others, what he said, they praise the night and the day, and they do not break down [Al -Anbiya: 20] and he said, and we are the best of the good [Al -Saffat: 165, 166] And if it is also their worshipers in the end of the hardship, if it is proven that, their worshipers are more preferred; For him, peace and blessings be upon him.That is, the servant is the more he cares for the sake of the satisfaction of his money more, it was more right to exalt and advance.And it is a saying that he says on the two guys: That is because we see some Sufis in our time, this is borne in the way of the stigmatized from the hardships and the disturbance of what is cut off by that the Prophet ﷺ was not borne that is the same That the Prophet ﷺ is better than him, and from his proverbs, but he is told about the servants of the Indian and their misery and their doves.The example of one of the prophets and the guardians is with their disbelief, so we learned that the abundance of hardship in worship does not require the increase of the reward.The reward is only based on the references and the limitations, so perhaps the one verb will come to him, both of the assets, while it is related to the acts of shadow Great and the other is not worth a little reward, because since one of them is more severe and more than the second of the second, then the abundance of worship and its hardships does not We say: We do not deliver that the worshipers of angels are harder.As for his saying in the first direction: the heavens, like the whims of the offspring, say: a Muslim, but you did not say that the worship of worship is in the good places of the good of the good.The new?More in the door is to say: He may give him the causes of the blessing, so his abstaining from it with its abandonment is more difficult for him, but it is a opponent, since the reasons for the reasons With their meeting with them, they are satisfied with the judiciary of God and do not change them that time and pests from the fear of Him and the perseverance of the servants of it, Thus, the servants and slaves are the same as their hearts with the servitude if they are found from blessings and foolishness, and no one of them is patient with the state of hardship on the servant of the one who was in the servant of the one who was in the servant of the servant of the They mentioned it with the first one, but its saying: and the perseverance on one type of worship is difficult, we said this is opposed to another face, which is that they are (P-200) The worship has become like the forced on the thing that is unable to disagree with what was said: the habit is a fifth -year -old, so that the species is in the name Therefore, the Prophet ﷺ forbade the connection in the fast, and he said: And the third of it: They said: The worship of the angels is a lighter, so it was better, that it is the blood of its saying, and the exalted, the night and the day, and the day is not.Their clients were equal to the architecture of humanity, because their obedience was more and more and more as a good, and no proportions of the age of all human beings to the age of the angels on the authority The angels, and on this verse a question: It was narrated in the people of faith on the authority of Abdullah ibn al -Harith ibn Nawfal, who said: I said to the cord that I saw the saying of God And the day is not fascinated, then he said: Make the angels a messenger [Fatir: 1] Do you not be the message that is forbidden for them to praise?Also, those who are upon them said that the curse of God, the angels, and the people all [the cow: 161], so how do they be in the way of the people?He answered as a play Al -Habar, and he said: Praise be to them as breathing for us, so that our preoccupation with breath does not prevent us from talking, so we are our prejudice by praise.And I say: For a saying that he says: Exaggeration by breathing, but it was not forbidden to speak; Because the machine of breath is other than the machine of speech.They have a lot of people who praise God, the Almighty, and they cursed the best of God Almighty with some other.And the second answer: the curse is the parcel and the distance, and the praise is the row in the praise of God, the Almighty, and there is no doubt that the praise of God is obligated to distract those who are not in the absence The curse is from its boundaries.The third answer: His saying does not break down [Al -Anbiya: 20] It means that they do not break from the determination to perform it in its consequences that are appropriate for it as it is said: It is not intended for it that he is never intended to be occupied by it, but he is intended for it that he is persevered in determination ever in its performance in its duties, and if it is proven that it is a servant.As for first; Because the most severe is more difficult, it will be better than what preceded it in the second pilgrimage, and secondly: He said to him, peace be upon him: His work, “The angels, may God’s prayers be upon them, are the most righteous servants and the best of them is, so they must be the best of worshipers.Because he, peace be upon him, said: “The sheikh in his people is like a prophet in his nation.And it is a saying to say: Noah, peace be upon him, as well as lumines So what they said, and we found in the nation who is the most prolonged age and the most extensive of the Prophet ﷺ and he is one of it in the cervical from the throne to what is under the rich.And verification in it is what indicated that the many rewards are, but it will bring a matter that is returned to the reasons and the cuts.Many rewards and many obstacles fall on a face that is only worthy of a little reward.And the one who has been: that they preceded the precedents in all worships, not a privilege of the characteristics of religion except and they are imams who are presented in them, but they are the origin of the people who are in the way The worship is a vulnerable and great one.He said to him, peace be upon him.The resurrection ““ This requires that it has been obtained for the angels from the reward.Creation of human beings.And it is a saying that he says: This requires that peace be upon him, more than Muhammad.Because he is the first to be the worship of God Almighty from the human beings and the first of the ages of calling the infidels to God Almighty, and when that was void with the unanimity of what he mentioned, and what he mentioned, and what he mentioned, There is a lot of reward that will be a matter that refers to the intention.Fifth: The angels are the messengers of the Prophet and the Messenger are better than the nation, so the angel is better than the prophets, but the angel is a messenger to the prophets, so he said: [Al -Nujam: 5] And his saying, the faithful spirit of it is upon your heart [the poets: 193].So, so, if it was said: the knowledge is that the one is the one who sends one to a great gathering to be a rule in them and take care of their matters, so that the Messenger of you will be blessed That gathering, but if he sends one to one to one, the Messenger is not honored by the messengers to him, as if he sent one of his servants to his weight in a milestone, then he does not That servant is honored by the minister, we said: But Jabriel, peace be upon him, is separated to all the prophets and the messengers from the human beings, so let him be over.Gabriel, peace be upon him, will be better than them.And know that this argument can be reported to another side, which is that the angels are messengers for the saying of the Almighty, making the angels a messenger [Fatir: 1] Either the king is a messenger to another king, or to one of the prophets who are from the human being, and on the ability, the king is a messenger and his nation is a messenger A messenger, but his nation is not a messenger, and the Messenger who all his nation is a messenger who is better than the Messenger who is not like that, so he has proven the best of the king The side; Because Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was a messenger to a Lot, peace be upon him, and he was better than him, and peace be upon him was a messenger to the prophet who were in the best of them Here.And whoever says: The king, if he sends a messenger to some of the aspects, may be because he made that messenger a ruler of them and those who are in charge of them.Their conditions and may not be; Because he sends him to them to tell them about some of the things with that he does not make him a rule over them The first section must be better than the messengers to it, but in the second oath, it is a show that it is not obligatory to be better than the messengers to the one who is the messenger to the From the first section, then they were not better than the nations, so why did you say that the mothers of the angels to the Prophet from the first section until they are required to be more than the best.* * * And its sixth: that the angels feared from the human beings, so they must be better than human beings, but they feared because they are innocent of the zalat and from the water to me; Because their fear is permanent and their agreement is permanent for his words, the Almighty: they fear their Lord from their understanding [Al -Nahl: 50] and his saying, and they are from his fear of the two: And the agreement contradicts the determination to disobey, and the Prophet, peace be upon them, understood that they are the best of humanity.From us, except for the disobedience or they are a disobedience, other than the son of Zakaria, upon whom peace is upon them.Exalted: I will honor you with God, I will fear you [the stone: 13].It is derived from seizure and no desire in the right of angels, so it will be reflected in the fulfillment of piety in their right.The answer to the first: that the formation of dignity on piety indicates that the dignity is treated with piety, so that the piety was more, the dignity was more, and the righteousness is not The lust is in their right, but there is no lust for them to the length and the municipality, but it is not necessary from the numbers of a certain lust, but the divorce of the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust, but the lust is the same And for this, they said: I will make it in it who spoils in it and shed blood, and we praise your praise and sanctify you, and he said: And whoever says that I am from them Hell [Al -Anbiya: 29].And it is a saying that he says: The hadith that you mentioned is indicating that peace be upon him.It is not necessary to increase the increase in the increase in the pioneering, and achieve it as it is that it is a necessity that it is a person, and the disobedience of the disobedience is not exported to him He deserved it with a hundred part of the reward and another person whose disobedience was issued for him, then he came with a obedience to which he deserved a thousand part of the reward, and he will be met with the reward of the reward.A part of the punishment, so the baptism of a reward for him will be a part of the reward.Also, we do not surrender to strengthen The angels are more severe, and that is because piety is derived from the endowment and the need for disobedience to the right of the children of Adam more, so the piety of those who are frequent of them were more than more.His saying: The angels have the lust of rituals, our saying: This does not harm us; Because this lust is also a good time, and it has been obtained for them for other types of lusts, which is the lust of the stomach and the vigor, and if it was like that, then it was the ritual of the lusts.More in the children of Adam, so you must be able to fear those who are more severe.And the seven of it: His Excellency said: The Christ will not be able to be a servant of God, nor the angels who are close to those who are close to The outstanding of confirmation came out to the first and like this affirmation, but it is the most remarkable remembrance, it is said: This wood is not appreciated by the lamb, nor is the one who does not.It is appreciated by the ten nor the one, and it is said: This scientist is not stopped from his servants, the minister, nor the king, and it is not said: He does not stop the servants of the servant.And it is a saying to say: This verse is indicated, then it is indicated by the virtue of the angels who are close to the Christ, but it is not obligatory from it.It is better than the Christ while he is Muhammad and Moses and Abraham, upon whom the prayer and peace, and the sentence, would have been proven that the Christ is better than all the prophets, then it was a matter The significance is for that, so they do not get their intention, and they may not have the Muslims.With the grace of the Christ on Moses and Abraham, peace be upon them.On that the Christ is not enough, and the angels do not stop.The proof of the total claim, then the example is opposed to another example, and it is what I have helped on this matter is more and no age, so this does not benefit from the age of Omar His Excellency said: Neither the guidance nor the qalid, nor the faithful of the forbidden house [Al-Maaidah: 2].The wood is not appreciated by its one, nor the tenth, so we are with our minds that the twenty is stronger than one, so we do not know that the abuse is the remembrance of the second one, so the one is the one who is the one who is the second.Rather, we recognized it with this way, not from the extension of the memorial, so we are in the verse, but we can know that what is meant is from his saying, nor the angels, who are close to the one: [172] If we knew before that The angels, who are close to the Christ, and then the health of this verse is standing on the evidence of the one who is required before this, and this is the same.It is proven that the one who is required is the significance of this verse, so it is necessary for the rotation, and that it is invalid, our peace is that it benefits the recession, but it does not benefit the vigor in all the downs.Without another, his two, if it was said: This scientist is not stopped from the servant of the judge or the Sultan, then this is not beneficial except that the Sultan is more complete than the judge in some And the evacuation and the Sultan and does not indicate his being better than the judge in knowledge and asceticism and subjugation to God Almighty if you prove this, then we say that it is.That is because the king is better than human beings in capacity and oppression, so the gabril of peace be upon him, the castle of the lengths of Lot, and human beings do not appreciate anything Following human beings in the many rewards that have been made by the increase in subjugation and worshipers, and the fulfillment of investigations in it is that the different virtue in it is in this way, it is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in it in this in this way, And the many rewards are only with the servitude, and the servitude is a phrase of the end of the humility, the subjugation, and the universe of the servant, who will be blessed by the humiliation The Entity of the servitude of God, and the deceased is not perfect, but it contradicts and contradicts it.The equivalent of the person with the severe ability and the great attachment, for it is a suitability for the murder and the absence of the servants, for the Christians when they witnessed the praise of the peace of the peace be upon him Al -Akbah and Al -Baras, they were removed from Al -Aboudiya by this destiny of power, so God Almighty said: Jesus does not depend on the extent of this destiny, not from the destiny of the one who is from the destiny of the authority of the power The one who is close to it in the power, power, oppression, and guests of the nations of the heavens and the lands, and on this direction, the face of the face of the face of It is better than human beings in severity and oppression, but it does not indicate the deception that it is better than the human being in the many rewards or it is said: they claimed it; Because he got from a father, he was said to them: The king did not get from a father or a mother, so they were more impressive than Jesus in that with that they are not stopped from the servants of the servants: That the intended and the fall between the Christ and the angels in the servants, not in power, power and oppression; And that is because it is upholstered and described them with their closeness, and the proximity of God is the Almighty that will not be in the place and the side, but by the perpetrator and the house, so what is it, so we will be in.We knew that what is meant is the occurrence of recklessness between them And among the Christ in the grades of the virtue, not in the severity and oppression.We said: If you are intended from this question that it is the Almighty and described the angels with their closeness, then it is obligatory that the Christ is not so, so this is false; Because you specialize the thing with the remembrance, it does not indicate its negation of what its merits, even if it is intended to be exalted when he described them with their approximation that they are close.That is, this is also invalid, as it is to be Christ and those who are close to their partnership in the adjective of the proximity in the obedience, and they will see other things in other things, so they will be in other things.Those things.* ” Another question: Perhaps he is the Almighty, but he mentioned this speech with the righteous people who believed that the king is better than human beings, so he mentioned the words on the authority of their belief in what they said.On him [Al-Rum: 27] (P-204) and eighth: His Excellency is a story about the Bliss of what we have forbidden for this tree, except that you are the owners of us or the two of us.And if he was not determined by Adam and Hawa on them, peace is that the king is better than the human beings, and the best of them is unable Peace be upon you.And it is a saying that he says: This is the saying of Pliss, so it is not a pilgrimage, and it is not said: Adam believes that the validity of that is, otherwise what is associated with, and the concealment of Adam Hajjah; Because we say: Perhaps the peace be upon him, he made a mistake in that, either because the misfortune is evident to the prophets, or because it was not a prophet in that time, and for the time of the time Peace be upon him, and it was not before the costume as a prophet.The king is better than human beings in some of the desired things, so you said: It is indicative of the king’s grace over the human beings in the chapter of reward?This is because there is no conflict that the king is better than human beings in the chapter of ability and power, and in the chapter of goodness and beauty, and in the chapter on the righteousness and purity from the cards that occurred in the heart of the rituals They were created from the lights, and the edema of the soil was created, so may peace be upon him, and if it is better than them in the many rewards, but he wanted to be the equivalent of those who are in the way We prepared it, so the alienation was from this direction, and also, and it was said, except that you are the owners of us [Al -Arif: 20] It is expected to be what is meant, except that you will be transferred, so that you will decrease.It is valid for your response, and it is necessary for what is meant is that the prohibition is concluded with the angels and the immortals For others: What you have forbidden is such that you only be so and so that the meaning is that the one who is so is so without you The suspicion of them is that it is the suspicion of the suspicion that they are not forbidden, but the forbidden is otherwise, and it is also that the verse indicates that the king is more than a good one That the king is better than Muhammad?That is because the Muslims have gathered on the authority that Muhammad is better than those who have peace, and there is no obligation than the king of the king than preferred than the one who is preferred.And the ninth: His Excellency said: Say: I do not say to you for me, the cabinets of God, and I do not know the absence, and I do not say to you that I am a king [Al -Anam: 50] and the saying that he says: I am a king in the many sciences, and the intensity of ability and which indicates this validity and faces.The first: It is that the disbelievers demanded it with great matters, as the heavens and the transportation of the mountains, and the great money of the money, and these things are not possible Many and severe ability.The second: that his saying, Say: I do not say to you for me, the cabinets of God, this indicates that he is unable Because it is not a scholar of all the information, then his saying, and I do not say to you that I am a king with its meaning, and God knows He claimed a capacity like the king of the king, nor a science like their sciences.The third: His saying, and I do not say to you that I am a king that he did not want to deny the image; Because he does not benefit the abuse, but he denied that he has the same as the characteristics they have, and this is sufficient in his honesty that he will not have the same as what they have and do not have the attributes For their attributes of all the faces, and there is no significance in it on the fall of the recession in all the attributes, then the inclusion in all of it is not otherwise, and the contradiction is all.And I adore it: His Excellency said: This is not good, if this is only a good king [Yusuf: 31] If it was said: Why is it not permissible for what is meant and the arrival of the rituals in the ritual That the likeness to be located in the biography, not in (P-205), the image, because he said: This is only a generous king, so he likened him to the honorable king, and the king is only a good With his image, it was proven that the intended to resemble him with the king in the negation of the references of humanity from the desire and the urge to seek the desire of the man The eyesight, and a suppression of the molice to the forbidden, so this verse was referred to the gathering of the mind Bosurus.And the saying that He says: The saying of the woman, so that he is the one in which I am as good as the wounds that the women are intended to say that this is only a generous king [Yusuf: 31] Good and beautiful, not in the biography; Because the appearance of its excuse is in the severity of its love, it is obtained by the excess of Yusuf in the camels, not by the excess of its existence and its horror.If that does not suit the intensity of its love for him, we greeted us that what is meant is that he is likely to be upon him, peace be upon him.Peace is less reward than the angels, and that is that there is no conflict in that the number of pessimisms to the obedience and the heavens is less than that of the angels of the angels to these things, for you, for you In addition to the meaning of the most reward?If you hold that everyone was less disobedient, it must be better, and the words were preceded by him.The sharp pilgrimage is ten: His Exalted: We prefer them to many of those who created our preference [Al -Asra: 70] and the creatures of God, the Almighty, or the one The costs are better than others.There is no doubt that mankind is better than jinn and demons, and if he was better than the king, too, then the human being would be more than all of the creature Exalted: We preferred them over many of those who created us.This is our knowledge that the king is better than human beings, and a saying that he says: He has these words touching the evidence of the speech; Because the permissibility is that it is better than many of the creatures, it does not indicate that it is not better than the rest except by means of the discourse, and it is also the same Adam, but it is not necessary than one of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two bonds One of the slaves of each one of them equals the hundred dinars, and ten lasts in which a servant is equal to the two hundred dinars, and the remaining nine will equate each one.The first group is better than the second group, except that it was obtained in the second group and one is the best of each one than one of the first group, so it is so and so [Al -Asra: 70] It is permissible for the meant to be and we prefer them in the dignity that we mentioned in the beginning of the verse, and it is his saying, and we have honored us with the children of Adam [Al -Asra: 70] The good of the image, the more intelligent, and the ability on the wondrous works, and the exaggeration in the cleanliness and the flower, and if it is also, then we will We receive that the king is more than human beings in these affairs, but you did not say that the king is more rewarding than human beings, and too, he said: He created the heavens.[Lamman: 10] It is not necessary that there is a baptism that is not a visionary, and also his saying is the Almighty: And whoever calls with God is another God, there is no proof of it: [117] There is another god for him with a proof, so they are here.* * * The second pilgrimage is ten: the Prophet, peace be upon them, did not seek forgiveness for anyone, unless they began to seek forgiveness for themselves, then after that (P-206) The believers, Adam said: Our Lord, our injustice is our souls [Al -Araf: 23], and Noah, peace be upon him, said, Lord, forgive me, my father, and whoever entered my house: Lord, forgive me and my parents [Noah: 28] And the Lord said: “He gave me a judgment and joined me with the righteous” [Al -Shua’ar: 83] and Moses said: Lord, forgive me and my brother [151] For Muhammad ﷺ and ask forgiveness for your guilt and the believers and the believers [Muhammad: 19] and he said to forgive God for you what you are offered from your sin and what you are late [2] They did not seek forgiveness for themselves, but they asked for forgiveness for the believers from the human beings, which is indicated by his saying, and they will be forgiven for them.Your path and the suffering of the torment of hell [Ghaffir: 7] and he said, and they seek forgiveness for those who believed [Ghaffir: 7] If they were needed to seek forgiveness, they will be forgiven.Because the payment of the release from the soul is presented to pay the warning from others, and he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him.From human beings.And it is a saying that he says: This face does not indicate that the angels have not been issued by them, and that the human beings have been released from them.Throwing in that is not required in the guidance, and among those who said that seeking forgiveness for good news, such as excuse, whoever stabbed them with their saying, I will say to them.In it the third pilgrimage is ten: His exalted say, and if you are kept as a categorical man [Al -Anfar: 11], and this is a year in the right of all the costs of those who are in The prophets and others, and this requires their virtue more than the human being to Jahin: The first: that he is the high He distanced from mistake and shame from the Muhdhid, and that requires them to be a distance from the sins and is close to obedience from the human beings, and that requires that it is more.And the Almighty made their writers a pilgrimage to good news in obedience and to them in sins, and that requires that their saying be their acceptance of the acceptance of the saying of the good Bosur is greater than them, so the matter was reflected.And it is a saying to say: As for his saying: The preservation must be generous from the grandson, then this is far away, for the king may trust some of his servants, and he is not for him The preservation is honored by the grandson there, but his saying: He made their martyrs out of the human vulnerability; Because the witness may be the same as the witness to it.The fourth pilgrimage is ten: His exalted say: The day the spirit and the angels rise with a class that only speaks to those who authorize the Most Merciful and said: The most exaggerated in the evil of the greatness of God is the Almighty and its majesty, even if the creation was another sect of their resurrection and their burden is stronger than the news of the greatness of God and the greatness of God Their remembrance is first in this place, then as it is the grace between the greatness of itself in the hereafter with the remembrance of the angels, so it is so that his greatness in the world is the remembrance The angels are barefoot from the throne, praising the praise of their Lord [Al -Zamer: 75].It is permissible that that situation is their strength, their intensity, and their oppression, and this is as it is said that the Sultan is when he sat down and stood around his beds, the world of the world is subject to those who are subject to those who are subject to those who are.Sultanate is explained by that, then if this does not indicate that they are honored with the Sultan of his son, so we are here.The fifth pilgrimage is the same: His Excellency and the Faithful are the one who believes in God and His angels, his books and his messengers [Al-Baqara: 285] (p-207) Belief in these things, then began with itself and praised the angels and the third of the books, and he raised the messengers, as well as in his saying, God is not God Amr: 18] And he said that God and his angels pray to the Prophet [Al -Ahbab: 56] and the adherence to the remembrance is indicated by the adherence in the custody, and it is indicated by the grace of the In the remembrance of a well -known, it is necessary to be a legitimate ugliness, but it is a curehrum; Because the poet said: ؎ is a blindness, and he called if you prepared for the adherence to the bad and Islam for the woman, forbidding Omar ibn al -Khattab: If you would have gone to the peace They wrote the book of reconciliation between the Messenger of God ﷺ and among the entrepreneurs, the conflict falls in the validity of the name, as well as in the book of reconciliation between Ali and Ma’awad Advance in the remembrance indicates the more honorable, and if it is proven that it is in the nose as well, it must be on the part of that; For him, peace be upon him: “What the Muslims have seen is good.In the best And whoever says: This is a weak argument; Because the accusation is if it is on waw, the waw does not benefit the synchronization, and if it is on the condemnation in the remembrance, it is contradictory to the presentation of the surah, which is the one who says it.The sixth pilgrimage is the same: His Excellency is: God and His angels pray to the Prophet [Al -Ahzab: 56] so make the prayers of the angels, such as the honor, and the good As the angels are honored by the Prophet ﷺ, and a saying to say: This is invalidated by his saying: O you who believe, pray upon him [the parties: 56] On the Prophet, and he was not obligated to be the one who is better than the Prophet, peace be upon him, so in the angels.The precedent Hajj is ten: that we speak in Jabril and Muhammad ﷺ and say: Gabriel, peace be upon him, is better than Muhammad, and the evidence is upon him.A generous messenger said with a powerful person with a throne is an angel, then a mother, and what accompanies you with madness [Al-Takwir: 19-22], and God Almighty described the Almighty.The characteristics of the kinam, one of them: his eyes as a messenger to God.And the second: its generousness is upon God Almighty.And the third of it: his ostrich is a power of God, and his strength is with God, only his strength is based on obedience, where he does not strengthen it.And the one who is sealed: his color is an angel with God.Fifth: It is obedient in the world of the heavens, and its sixth: his ethnicity in all obedience is absent from the types of betrayals.Then, he gave him and after he was described by Jabriel, peace be upon him, with this high characteristics and described Muhammad ﷺ with his saying: What is the one who is the one who is the one [ Muhammad, peace be upon him, peace be upon him, in the attributes of the best or comparison with him, and the description of Muhammad is with this description after the description of Jabril, with the righteousness Muhammad ﷺ and a criminalization of his affliction and heroes for his right, and that is unable to God It is possible to say: It is not a crane, and that indicates that there is no proportions between Jabril and between Muhammad, peace be upon them.If it is said: Why is it not permissible for him to say: He said a generous Messenger [Al -Takwir: 19] a characteristic of Muhammad, not to Jabril, peace be upon them.His saying: He saw it with the clear horizon [Al -Takwir: 23] that is invalidated, and a saying that he said: We agreed all that it was for me.So, he is not a madness, and that God is upset, and he mentioned something from that virtue in this position, so the (P-208) is the same as the remembrance of God.Name it with consensus, or if it is proven that Muhammad, peace be upon him, has the same To be said: Peace be upon him, peace be upon him, because of those virtues that are not mentioned.Peace be upon us with these six attributes and described Muhammad ﷺ also with six attributes and they said: Oh, the Prophet, we sent you a witness and a farewell and a vow to the good Mnir [Al -Ahdab: 45, 46] The first description: his statement is a prophet and the second: his being is a messenger, and the third: his color is a witness, and the lord: the one who is the one: He is a vow, and the sixth: his being called to God Almighty with his permission, and the fourth: his being is a sage, and the eighth: his color is a light and a sentence With description, the atmosphere does not indicate that of those descriptions from the second.* * * The eighth pilgrimage is ten: the king is aware of the human being, and the knowledge is better.Because Jabriel, peace be upon him, was a teacher of Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the evidence of his saying: He taught him Shadid the powers [Al -Najim: 5] and the teacher is not The learner, and also, the sciences are seven: one of them: the sciences that are connected to the minds like the knowledge of God Almighty and his attributes, so it is not permissible for it to be permissible.Jabriel, peace be upon him, or Muhammad, has ﷺ; Because the negligence in that is ignorant, and it is urged in the knowledge of God, the Almighty, and the knowledge of the creatures of God Almighty and the wonders and the knowledge of the Lord, and the knowledge, and the knowledge, Heaven, fire, and the heavens, the types of angels, and the types of animals in the molds, mountains, and seas, so he did not doubt that Jabril, peace be upon him, knows it; Because he, peace be upon him, take long and more witnessed to her, so his knowledge of it was more and more.And the second: the sciences that are not connected to it except with the revelation, not to Muhammad, nor the wipers of the Prophet, peace be upon them, except from the side of Jabril, peace be upon him.For Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is a virtue in which he is on the authority of peace be upon him, and Jabriel, peace be upon him, was among the rituals between God, and among the Almighty, among the people of God With all the past and the present, and it is also a scholar of the goods of the angels and their integrity, and praise be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.More knowledge of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and if this is proven, this must be better than him; To say to the Almighty: Say: Are those who know and those who do not know [Al -Zamer: 9].And it is a saying to say: We do not surrender that they know from the human being, and the evidence is upon him that they have recognized that peace be upon him is more knowledgeable than them, he said: They predicted them with their names, then if we are more knowledgeable, but that does not require the many rewards, then we see the man who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one He deserves something of the reward, as it is more than the reward for it, and the reason for it is what we warned, and it is necessary for it that the many rewards, but it is obtained in the right of the sake of the sake, The most angels are more.The nineteenth pilgrimage is the one who said it: And whoever says that I am a god without it, so we will make it a hell.The raising and the highest of the perpetrators until they did not know the command of God, the Almighty, when they were immortalized, except by calling the divine, not with something other than the follow -up of the desires, and for you.And it is a saying that he says: There is no conflict in the end of their majesty, but his saying: They have reached the raising and the way to the path to where if they did not know the command of God Divine, this is a Muslim, and that is because their sciences are many and their strength is severe, and they are innocent of the lust of the stomach and the vulva, and whoever is like that, then if it is not the matter The meaning that I mentioned, but why did you say that that indicates that they are more rewarded than human beings?The place of disagreement is only that.The ten pilgrims: His words are upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.He honored, and a saying that he says: This is one of the best and white, so this indicates that the fullness of the angels is better than the fullness of the humanity, and the fullness of the human beings is not from the good From the king of the king is better than the year of humanity, as they are better than the prophets, this is the last of the words in the significant indications, and I know that the philosopher agreed on the authority that the signs agreed upon The name of the angels is better than the human signs, and they are intended in this section on the faces of the mental we are remembered if God wills.The first pilgrimage: They said: The angels are with a righteousness of many and human beings are installed from the soul, the body, and the soul is compounded by the many forces, the many and the parts Many, and the ritual is better than the compound; Because the causes of the number of the ride are more than the bars; Therefore, the Hardaniya of God is the highest of the attributes of His Majesty and the rituals of his arrogance.The symptoms are: We do not surrender that the sewn is honored by the compound; That is because the spirit of the spirituality is one of the one, and the sides of the Jesusan are the commandments of his soul and his body, so it is from the spirit of the spirit of spirituality and the lights, and from where the bodies are from the world A collection of the spirit and the Jesusan must be better than The spiritual, the pure and the generous, is the secret of making the first human beings a prostration of the angels and from another face, which is that the royal aspects of the absence Justice, as if it was used in its maqamiyyah in its mauen residences.The two worlds, so you will not promote it in the acquaintances of the knowledge and the glory of the sanctuary, which will be disabled from the mobilization of the lower world, nor their tattooing to the organizations of the world of the bodies of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the bodies in the world of the world.The signs, so its strength was fulfilled by the mobilization of the two worlds, surrounded by the genius of the genius, so it must be honorable and great.The second argument: the spirituality of the spirituality is broken from the desire that is the origin of your bloodshed, and the human aspects are counted with it, and the devoid is from the one who is the one.Syndicates: There is no doubt that the perseverance of the servant with the many obstacles and obstacles is evidence of salvation from the perseverance against it from something of the goods and the domains of the consequences The shrine of human beings in love is higher and overall, and also, the spirituality is when they obeyed their creators, and their obedience did not obey Her uncle obeyed for that obedience the abundance of the Shahwani and anger forces, which is the devils of humanity, so their obedience was complete, and also from the phenomenon that the souls said: We know only what you taught us to be fully taught from their grades when I said: I will make it in it who spoils in it and what is that is only by the crushing that has been in the shadow, and this is the one who has been in the shame, and this is in the shame.The prayers and peace be upon him, as a story about his Lord, the Exalted: “Because where the sinners love me from the weight of the praises.” The power is that everything was possible for it according to its types that are in its own people, so it came out to the verb, and the prophets are not like that; And for this, peace and blessings be upon him said: “I will seek forgiveness from God in the day and night a hundred times one hundred With complete action, it is honored by the strength.Syndicates: We do not surrender that it is with the complete act, so perhaps it is strong in some matters, and this is said: its sacrifices for the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake The verb, and this is the sacrifice of the proportions to it, such as the exhibiting savings of the people who are located to the forces of thought and imagination at the time of the sake of the sake of the sake Acting.The Funny Hajj: Spiritualism is the extent of the existence of the extent of the temptation, and the power and the soul The human heroic is not like that.Paths: The two of the two types are not that the spirituality is possible to provide themselves with their pleasures and the obligation of the existence of their substance, so it is the event of our peace.Hashariyah is a height, but rather it is an eternal one and these are they said: These aspects were sarids, like the shadows under the threshold of the throne.The first start is that it came to the world of the bodies and the residence of the materials, so when these bodies were stuck to the bodies, I loved it, and it is required of it, and it is the same as it.And he honored it to this world to be defrauded in seizing those aspects of that residence, and this is what is meant by the chapter on the updated bumper that is mentioned in the book “Kalil and Damen”.* * * Fifth Hajj: Spiritualism is a gentle luxurious, and the spagues are dark, thick, and the beginnings of the minds that the light is witnessed that the light of the light is the same Dhimma, the ultimate is better than the lower, and the gentle is fully fully than the thick.Paths: This is all a sign of the material, and when the honorable people are the leadership of the command of the Lord of the two worlds on what he said: Say the spirit from the matter of my Lord and claim the honor The first argument of the eyes, and he was told what was said.The sixth pilgrimage: the heavens of the heavens, the grace of the gestures of the power of science and work, while the science is the agrees of rule over the surrounding the spirituality of the soul On the acceptance of the affairs, and also their actual acts are a permanent fungal.And the science of human beings against the opposite in all of that, but the work is because they are always on the servant of servitude, they praise the night and the day, they do not fool, and they do not suffer The minds, nor the fear of the eternity, their food is praise and their drinking is mastery, timing, and cheering, and their soul is the remembrance of God, and their joy is from God.The urban perpetrators are not arguments with something of the Shahwani and angry forces, so who is one of the two sections from the other?.Paths: We do not have a conflict in everything that you mentioned, except that here is a tightness, which is that the perseverance is on the enemies of the gentle nutrition, and it does not enjoy it as it is the same as the one who is the same as the one.The angels in the cause of their perseverance on those high degrees are not found from the pleasure, such as what finds the human beings who are in the most in the most beautiful of the people The body of the darkness and the darkness of this is the same as what is devoted to the human being And the mountains are two people to carry it, and they are separated from it and the human bearers [Al -Ahdab: 72].The delicious perception of the fats on the path of the permanent, and for that the kindergarten said: The free place in the fever of accuracy is more severe than them in the fever of the fool, but the foolish fever is in accuracy, if it is long.Feeling about it, so this situation did not get the angels; Because (P-211) as their levels are always and did not get the bodies of the bodies; Because it was empty of the restored power of the murderous realization, and nothing remains of those who strengthened this safety, except for good news.The precedent argument: the spirituality has a power on the score of the bodies and the conversion of the boundaries, and the power that is for them is not from the gag And for the absence, then you see the gentle raw from the planting in the beginning of its growth, the wrapping of the stone and the hardness of the rock, and that is only for the power of a vegetative, and it is overwhelmed by the power of the What you think of these heavenly powers, and the spirituality are the ones that are displayed in the bold bodies, they are reversed and a wilderness that you do not lose weight, and they do not burden you.The mountains, the winds are blowing with their sacrifices and clouds are exposed and disappeared in their destruction, and so the semicon falls into the mountains in the cause of its vicinity, and the parties of the one who said: The divisions are an order [the aircraft: 4] and the minds are also indicative of it, and the lower aspects are not like that, so it is one of the two divisions from the other.And it is said that the demons that are the stretching aspects are appreciated by that of a variety.Because the good and royal souls are distorted to the organizations of this lower world and its reconciliation, and the fascinating souls distract their forces to the evil, so who is one of them?Syndicate: It is not far from the human souls, a complete, fully powerful soul, on the basis of the mourning of the mourning, with the vigor, the vulnerability.On the abuse of such a soul.The eighth pilgrimage: the spirituality has excessive choices from the lights of the majesty of God, glory and a long -standing man to the treachery, short on the system of this world, and it is not the same.Corruption, with the differences of the choices of humanity, is that it is a frequency between my high and luxurious destination, and my good aspects, and their money is to the good, but it will be caused by the insistence A king who fills him and guides him.Syndicates: This indicates that the angels are like those who are forced to obediently, and the prophets are hesitant between the two parties, and the choice is better than the man Because the frequency is as long as it remains a matter of the truth of the verb, and if the hypothesis is due to the right to the obligatory, then the angels were good for power and the righteousness of the angels Doing, either [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to
