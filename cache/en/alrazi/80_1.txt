For this reason, the wandering has been obtained, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: (And those who call their Lord with the time and the east [Al -Anam: 52].He is on the authority of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him.Their relatives, their honor, and their position, and his rituals were alienated from the blind with the causes of his cousins, the number of his relatives, and the lack of honor, and the honor of the For this preacher, the crops are notified, not to be disciplined, but rather the discipline for this preacher.To hold his affairs, but rather it was said that he is the reason for his consciousness, he deserves the more accompaniment and the head, so how can he be able to do you.The third question is that he was hurt in the discipline of his companions, but here we are what they were presenting the songs on the poor, and that was what was delusional of the one who was delusional, For this reason, this is the second question.That action, indicate that that action was disobedient, and this is far away, so we have shown us that that was the duty of the appointed, and it is not according to this The riches are presented to the paragraphs, and that is not a long time to solve the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him.That is the sin of the third.Makhmoum, and he was read by the tension of the lagum and the like, it was salted in a salt, if it came to him with a lord or with the disagreement of the one.In the rituals of the closer or the distant and its meaning: he worshiped because the blind came to him, and he was presented to that, and it is read to come to him with two wives and a scourge between them, and he stand It is meaning that the blind came to him, and it is intended for him to deny it.He knew that in the news, what was overlooked from the Messenger of God, then the Heading of Him (P-52) by speech is evidence of the increase in denial, as he complains to the people, and the one who reaps it.Fever in the complaint, confronting the stinging and commitment of the argument.
