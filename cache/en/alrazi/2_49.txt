Because whoever has escaped, that is, they were saved; Because the highlighting position is clear when he was degraded, as if he was a sauce from him.The owner of the scout said: The origin of a family is a family, and for that he is tempted to be tempted, so his these are a thousand thousand, and he was privileged with his sins with the first of the risk and the one who is the one who said: The coffins and the censorship, Issa said: The people are the best of the family, it is said: the people of the kufa and the people of the country and the people of knowledge and it is not said: the family of the kufa and the family of the country and the family of knowledge, as if it is the one who said: The side of its abolition is on them, and the family is especially the man from one side or companions.It was narrated from Abu Ubaidah that he heard a shouting saying: The people of the Mecca of the family of God.As for Pharaohs, it is a knowledge of the king of Egypt from the domain as a disorder, and a murder of the king of the Romans, and a break of the possession of the Persians, and a follower of your king Lighting, and dispersed in Pharaoh from two faces: one of them: that they disagreed in his name, and Ibn Jarraj narrated from the people that they said: Al -Walid ibn Musaab, and it was not one of the most severe, and not harder than a heart of it, and he mentioned that the son of the Prophet was mentioned.From the dump.The second: Ibn Wahb said: Pharaohs, peace be upon him, is Pharaoh Moses, and this is not correct, as he was among the entry of Joseph, and from the time of the Forty years, and Muhammad ibn Ishaq said: He is not Pharaoh Yusuf, and that Pharaoh Yusuf was his name Al -Rayyan bin Al -Walid What is meant by us who was from the people of Pharaoh, and they are those who have been determined to the sons of the children And the destruction of Pharaoh and his people.As for the saying of the Exalted: They prayed for you, then it is the one who is a luster if he is unjustly, Amr ibn Kalitoum said: If the king is the poison of the people, we are the one who is a luster, and we are the one who is a luster that we are.The sake of the sake Request it, as if in the sense that they want the bad torment and want it to you, and the bad is a source of misfortune in the sense of the bad, it is said: I seek refuge in God from the misfortune of the good, The meaning of bad torment and torment (P-64) is all bad and difficult as if his ugliness [increased] in addition to a misfortune, and those who are disagreed in the meantic of the bad of the person who is intended to be the one who said: Bin Ishaq: He made them immortal and serve him, and he classified them in his works of categories, so they were built, they were built for him, and they were softened, and they were for him, and they were for him, and they were for him, His work, and whoever was not in a type of his business was commanding that he be placed on him a reward he performed, and the six -year -old said: He had made them in the ruler of the dirty.The mourning, the work of the clay and the below of the mountains, and God narrated that the sons of Israel said that they said to Moses: We have come before we came to us and after what you have come to [129].And Moses said to Farjan: This is a blessing that you have to do with me that you worshiped the children If he uses it in the hard, difficult, dirty,, then this is one of the most severe types of torment, even if this is his condition, perhaps the death of God His blessings be upon them that we escaped from that, and then he is upholstered, followed by that with another good Females.We are research.The first research: that the slaughter of the male without females is harmful to its faces: one of them: that the slaughter of the father requires the annihilation of men, and that requires the decay of the seed; Because the women, if they are reluctant, do not influence them, a girl in that, and that will spend the last thing to the property of men and women.And the second: that the destruction of men requires the corruption of the people of the women in the matter of living, for the woman does not wish - and it has been cut off from the pledge of the men and the rituals To her from the affirmation of the righteousness, so this challenge is great in the cultivation, and the survival of it in the greatness is that it is according to its calculation and the third: that the one who killed the The hardship and the strong hope in the use of the Mawlid are the greatest of torment; Because he killed him and this case is more severe than killing those who remain the long period of time, enjoying him with his affliction, so the blessing of God is from the goodness of God.The cultivation is in it and its lords: that the sons loved the parents of the daughters, and for that, the most people are saving the daughters and their hatred, and if they are, and they are the most.One of them was preached to the female, the face of its face is a boring, and it is a shadow, which is fascinated by the people from the bad people who preached it [Al -Nahl: 58] the verse, and that is The Arabs forbade Al -Waddah by saying: Do not kill your children, the fear of a mother.[Al -Israa: 31] Their goods must be expressed by the deeds of the vigor, and that is the end of humiliation and humiliation.The second research: It is mentioned in this surah, they are slaughtered without wow and in Surah, his reminder, he mentioned it with the waw, and the face in it is that if he made the saying of his saying: Infidel with his saying: They sacrifice your children, and it is not invoked to waw, and if it is made his saying: they pray to you bad torment, and it is an evacuated with the cararis And the sacrifice was made something other than the bad torment, in which it is in it to the waw, and in the two times the two faces are destroyed, except that the good that is permissible is that it is permissible.The letter of compassion in the surah of Abraham is to say: It is up to him, before that verse: and we sent us Moses with our verses to bring your people out of darkness to the darkness and the light of the light [5] And the memory of the days of God does not get the rest of the blessings of God Almighty, so it is obligatory for what is meant by his saying: They prayed for you, the bad of the torment, and the one who is the one who is a prayer, And they sacrifice your children other types to be the one of them, two types of grace.For this, the remembrance of compassion is required there, but in this verse, the matter only wanted to remind the gag (P-65) [Al-Baqarah: 40] Even was intended from bad torment was the sacrifice or other than it was the reminder of the sweetener of the grace, so the difference appeared.The third research: some of them said: He wanted to say it: they sacrifice your children with men without kindness to be in the interview of women, as the women are the rituals of the rituals.The rhetoric, they said: He was commanding the killing of the men who are afraid of them, and the gathering of his command is afraid of them.And the most interpreters are that the one who is intended for the kindness is without the rhetoric, and this is the first for Wajh: the first: a load to the memorizers of the people.The second: He was excused to kill all men over their many.The third: They were needing them in their use in the heavy sons.The quarter: If it was like that, the meeting of peace be upon him in the coffin was the state of his child Fifan two answers: The first: that the sons, when they were killed by the state of the childhood, did not become a men, and the name of the men was not permissible to release them Women may release the name of the women.The second: Some of them said: What is meant by his saying: They are ashamed of your women, that is, they seize the neighborhood of women Carrying out or not, and that is invalidated by that what is in their stomachs if they were not the eyes of the eyes that were not known for the fragmentation, and it was not connected to his eagerness.The loyal research: in the causes of the murder of the children, they mentioned it in it: one of them: the saying of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him Ibrahim to make in his offspring a prophet and an angel, so they feared that, and their words agreed to prepare a man with the encryption, they floated in the children He mentioned only his slaughtered, and when they saw their adults, they died and their young people, they sacrificed the death, so they did not find those who are in the year of the year.And the second: the saying of the Saddi: If Pharaoh saw a fire, I accepted from the house of the sanctuary until it was derived from the yield of Egypt, and it was burned, and it was burned.Farn Al -Kahna and asked them about that?They said: It comes out of the house of the sanctuary who is the destruction of the domes on his hand.And the third of it: that the stars told the Pharaoh with that and appointed the Sunnah to him, so this was the killing of their children in that year and the closest is the first; Because who is beneficial from the science of expressions and the science of the stars is not a detailed matter, otherwise it will be praised in that of the luxury of the absence, but it is a miracle, but it is a matter of one The sane person is not to be presented in the same way as this great matter with his cause This great matter can be presented with the causes of the news of His Excellency, peace be upon him.We said: Perhaps Pharaoh was a disobedient to God and the truth of the prophets, except that he was a disbeliever, the disbelief of the ingratitude and the stubbornness, or it is said: He was a complainant in the debt of his religion Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was subjected to that action.Fifth Research: Know that the benefit is in the remembrance of this grace from its face Malouk and the darkness became the devilization of God from them from this time from the greatest of blessings and that because they have been appointed to the destruction of those who have tried their destiny and witnessed the humiliation of those who have been The greatest of blessings, and the greatness of the blessing requires the purity and obedience, and the end of the prejudice is required and the stubbornness.The greatness is exaggerated in the commitment of the argument against them and cut off their excuses.(P-66) and the second: that when they knew that they were in the end of humiliation and their characteristic was in the end of the glory, but they were right and their characteristic was invalid, not a generosity, and he was not a crime.The invalid, as if it is up to the Almighty, said: Do not be deceived by the poverty of Muhammad And the lack of his supporters at once, as it is a right and the splendor is flipped to his side and humiliation to the side of his enemies.And the third of it: that God Almighty has warned that the king is in the face of God, whoever is given to him, so it is not for a person to be deceived by the glory of the world, but rather the best of the sake.As for his words, the Almighty: And there is a great way from your Lord, the locking said: The origin of the word is from the abundance, which is the choice and the two sons said: The Almighty said: And he said: And we showed them with good deeds and women [Al -Araf: 168] and Al -Ballawi is located on the two types, so it is said to the rumors in the way of the righteousness and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance in the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance in the abundance of the abundance and the abundance in the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance of the abundance and the abundance in the abundance and the abundance of the good Blind and may enter one of them on the other.Zuhair said: God is good with goodness, what did you do with you ∗∗∗ and their best is the best of the calamity that is afflicted if you know this, then we say: The calamity is that it is the same Pharaohs and grace are made if he refers to it to the success and holds it on the first of the first; Because it is the one who has been issued from the Lord, the Almighty, and because the position of the Hajj is on the authority of God, the Almighty is upon their ancestors.
