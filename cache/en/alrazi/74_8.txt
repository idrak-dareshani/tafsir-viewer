The researcher of the Qurâ€™an is up to him: If it is decided in the Naqur, he knows that it is up to what is related to the guidance of the angels of the prophets, and he is the one who is the one who is a good The verse, and here are the issues: the first question: the fulfillment in its saying: if it is approved for the causes as if he said: He called their harm [Al -Ahbab: 48] so between them Punishment for their harm, and you will be punished by your patience.The second question: They disagreed that the time that is stable in the Naqur, is the first blow or the second blow?The first saying: It is the first blow.Al -Halimi said in the book of the curriculum: that it is the highest name of the images in two days; One of them is the pictures, the other one, and the saying of the interpreters: The bell is the pictures, then there is no doubt that the pictures, even if it is the one in which the two blows are blown away, It is contrary to the blowing of life, and it came in the news: that in the images, the number of all the aspects is all, and that it is collected in that dumping in the second blow, and it is the one who comes out from the ritual A spirit to the body that we are removed from, and the body will come back alive with the permission of God Almighty, and it is required that the images be at the time We blow in it to make a gathering between the click and the blowing, so that the shouting will be guided and great, and if it is blown in it for the life, it is not possible for it, and it is not possible for it, What is meant is to send the signs of the images of pictures to its bodies, not to be transmitted from its bodies, and the first blow to the corner, which is the counterpart of the sound of the throat, then if it is a person who dies, then he died.And the hard -working shouting that a man shouts with a young man, so he will die from him and die, this is the last of the words of Al -Halimi, may God have mercy Rather, he will be at the morning of the shock, and that day is not very severe (P-174) on the infidels, because they die in that hour, but the day of the day The morning of life, and for that they say: Oh, if it was the judge, that is,: Oh, we stayed on the first dead.And the second saying: It is the second blow, and that is because the bell is the one in which it is established, that is, it is disturbed, then it is permissible that if he wants to blow it in the second, we will be blown in the second.So he called an aorta of this meaning, and I say: In this memorization, he is searching, which is that the bell is one of the click, like the digestion of what is digested with it, and the survivor is what is destroyed by it What is left with what is stretched in it.The third question: the one who says in his saying: If we decide the meaning that his saying is indicated: a day of Asir and Al -Qudam: if we decide in the Naqur.
