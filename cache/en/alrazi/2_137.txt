The researcher of the Qur’an is up to him: If you believe in the same as what you have believed in, then they will be guided, and if they took care, then they are in a hardship, then God will be enough for them, and he is the knowledge of God Show the clear way in the religion, which is that the human being with the prophecy of the one who has the significance of its prophets, and that he is excluded from that of the contradiction: He said: If they believe in the same as what you believed in, they have been guided.From the faces: one of them: that the intensity of it is the installation and the meaning: if you get another debt like your religion and equal to it in health and payment, then they will be guided.Another debt is equal to this religion in payment From him, do it and you have learned that there is no harm from your opinion, but you want to fix your owner and his loyalty to what you saw, and I have not seen it, but he said: Another debt is equal to this debt in payment, because this religion is clear that everyone who appeared on the miracle appeared to him.On the contradiction, and the contradictory, it is impossible to be a barrier to others who are contradictory to payment and health.And the second: that the example is a link in the words, God Almighty said: It is not like anything [Al -Shura: 11], meaning that it is not something, and the poet said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ Dance and say: God, if not for a man with his legs, is a dignity in his leg from his slippery ∗∗∗ What was one of you as one like him (P-77) and the third of you: Correctional and warrior, for if they believe in the same way, it is the one who is not correct and forbidden, so they have been guided because they are connected to it to the knowledge of it.And its elevation: that it is his saying: If they believe in the same way as you have believed in any of them, then if they become believers in the same way as what you have, you will be believed, then the believer, then the believer, then the one who is a believer.The faith and the two believers, and Muhammad ibn Jarir al -Tabiri narrated that Ibn Abbas said: Do not say, then if you believe in the same as what you have believed in it, then it is not for him, and there is no one for him.Believe in the one that you believed in, the judge said: No face to leave the frequent readings from where the meaning is formed and wore because that if he made him the one who has been given to him The recitation of all similar verses, that is prohibited, and the first face in the answer is the one who is appointed.As for his saying: They have been guided, so what is meant is that they did what they guided to him and accepted him, and whoever is his condition is that he is for him within the people of his pleasure It was up before this aspiration, and that guidance can only be carried on the evidence that God has erected Humanity and reveal it and showed the faces of its significance.* * * Then indicate the direction of the mittle what they are attached to them, if they take over, and he said: And if they took care, they are in a slit and in the hardships with the urbanization: the first researcher: He said: It is taken from the hardship, as if it became in the hardship of the hardship of its owner with the causes of enmity and the division of the Muslim sticks if he separated themselves and separated it, and the separation of it, This is in a limit and that is in another limit, and the same is the same because this is in a number and that in a number, and the crazy is that this is in a side and that is in another side.Others said: It is from the hardship because each of them is keen on what is difficult for his owner and harms him.Between them in contradiction until one of them is difficult for the other.The second research: Its saying: If they take care of, they are in a row, that is, if you leave the same as this faith, then the contradictory and the sane do not be obligated to the contradiction.The adherence to it is our knowledge that their imposition is not the request of religion and the purity, but rather their abuse of the dispute and the purification of enmity.Then for the interpreters of phrases: the first: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: Rather, they are in disagreement in a disagreement since they left the truth and they were grabbed with the falsehood.And the second: Abu Ubaidah and a fight in a slit said: That is, in a delusion.And the third: Ibn Zaid said in a struggle and a fight.And the sequence of it: Al -Hassan said in an enmity.His companion in the hostility and anger of God and his curse and in the right of the fire, so this saying became a feast of it, and he became a good one of them, and he has become a sign of that of the people.He has bad people who are standing for his rhythm in the curse, for this is God, may God bless him It is strengthened by his heart and the heart of the believers, because it is up to him, if he sponsored the sufficiency in something that the confidence in which he said, the speaker said: This is a brother of the absence On his sincerity, but he said that he is a news about the absence and that because we found this news of this saying about what he told him because he is the Almighty, and the evil of the one who has been blessed with the evil and the evil The Muslims prevailed over them and took their paths and their money, so they were humiliated in their hands.Rather, we said: It is a miracle because it is the disclosure that does not occur in the same way as that in detail.It will be a contradiction to the return, and the habit has been running that everyone was fascinated by abuse Others, then it is said to him: Be patient, for God will suffice you from his evil, then this may happen to this He connected to that with a vision that he saw, and that is what is not a way to pay it, for the stars say: Whoever is the arrow of the absence in his lord is the one who comes to him He was not a prophet.The answer is that it is not our absence from our saying that it is incapable that this news is only a miracle, but we have exposed that the Qur’an is comprehensive of many of this, and this is the one who is from this Many in detail, which does not come from the false discovery.Then it is up to what he promised to support and the component, follow him with what indicates that what they are pleased with and what they declare from this matter is not hidden from him, and he said: He said: The first: It is a holiday for them and the meaning is that he realizes what they are destroyed and say while he is aware of everything, so it is not permissible for them to fall from them except when he is able to do so.The second: It is a promise to the Messenger, peace be upon him, meaning: He hears your supplication and knows your intention while he responds to you and connects you to your goal, and the companions of the companions of the people: On the authority of his listening to his knowledge of his knowledge, because his saying: (knowledgeable) by building a vagina, so he will be cursed as a scholar of all the knowledge of the whole, so he is a whole, so he is a whole Expressing his knowledge of the hearing, the repetition is necessary and that it is not permissible, so it is obligatory to be the adjective of its exaggeration, hearing, as well Know the right.As for his saying: the same as what you believed in, in it is a form, which is that the one who believes in the believers does not have an example, and his answer:
