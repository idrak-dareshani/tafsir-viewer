of what he did from disbelief and sins, so he would not have been permissible in his ruling that he would not be accused of him, so he would not punish him for the abundance All sins.(P-99) It is said that the Almighty said: So I will not be divided with the success and the night, and what is watered and the moon if it is consistent, so that you will be righteous for a class, so what they do not

dinner, so it is obligatory to be the one who is the redness, not the white, because the whiteness extends its time, and it will be lengthened, and it is the same, and it is the same, The rest of the sun, and then the sun was from the horizon, the redness of the redness.And the third of it: that the detection of the companion is what was of tenderness, and there is no doubt that the light is taken in tenderness and weakness from the absence of the sun, so it is the right of the red.As for his saying: The night and what he did not have said, the people of the language said: It was made of any

do not see [Al -Haqaqa: 38] and Said bin Jabir said: What he did in it, Al -Qafal said: It is possible that this is the slander of the slave of God He exalted her with forgiveness with magic, so it is

there are questions: The first question: Read: Gans; Because the call is in his saying: Oh, you are a heroic to the tongue.The second question: the class is what he applied otherwise, it is said: What

install it.The intensity is some of it, it is lifted from one another, which is the death and what is far from the domain of resurrection, and let us now remember the faces So you should be tired of it: one of them: that the meaning is to be installed, O human affairs and conditions, after one thing and after a state and a house after the house of the matter of what is a house that is not.It is on a person from heaven or fire, so that the permanence and the immortality will obtain, either in the house of reward or in the house A person, then he dies, and he will be in the park, then he will

on this estimation, they mentioned two and vials: one of them: that this is with the evil of the Prophet, and the righteous The liars of the mission, as if he said: I swear, Muhammad, so that you will

memorization after.As for his words, the Exalted: What they do not believe in two issues: the first question: the closeness is that what is meant is what they do not believe in the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake

injustice after a light, and on the other hand of the tallness from the vigilance To the sleep, and also his saying: and the moon if it is consistent, then it indicates a crime like the moon of the moon after it was incomplete, for it is the highest of the most obsessed with the absence Creation, and this indicates a piece of the validity of the mission, because the grace of the change of high and lower bodies is from one state to the case, not to the description of the row, to the description of the righteousness, not to the description of the righteousness.And to be in itself, it is possible for all the possibilities a scholar of all information.And who was like that, there was no condition, as far as the resurrection and resurrection, when what was before this verse is like the mind of the hero who is the one who said: Relax: What they do not believe.The second question: The judge said: It is not permissible for the wise to say who was unable to believe in faith.The
