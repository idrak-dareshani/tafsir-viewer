The researcher of the Quran, his exalted, and when Moses said to his people, Yaqim It is for you that it is the Most Merciful.Because it is a matter of killing, it is not a blessing, and this is a weakness of his faces: one of them: that God Almighty alerted them to the greatness of their sin, then he was alerted to them.The great and that is one of the greatest blessings in religion, and if God is the highest, it is a number of the worldly blessings on them, then this is the same This grace is how this repentance is not when it was not described by the submission of the remembrance of disobedience, its remembrance was also from the blame This verse is prepared in the blessings of God, and he was reminded of it.And the second: that God Almighty, when he commanded them to kill them, raised this matter for them before their sons in the kidneys, so that was a blessing in the right of those who are the first.And in the right of those who were present in the time of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him; Because he was upset, had it not been for the killing of their fathers, when these children were found, then his revenue is good in the disposal of the one who is the one who is in the present.And peace.And the third of it: It is upset when it was clear that the repentance of those who were not fulfilled except by killing with the fact that the praise be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, he said to them: There is no need for you now You returned from your disbelief and believed that God accepted your faith from you, so the two stretching in that repentance was alerted him to the great year of the acceptance of the same.And its elevation: that there is a severe desire for the nation of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him in the repentance, for the nation of peace be upon him, when they wanted to do so in that Its hardships on the soul, so that one of us desires the repentance that is the regeneration of the denomination was the first.It is known that the desire of the human being in what is important reconciliation is one of the greatest blessings.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: When Moses said to his people, that is, and they mentioned, when Moses said to his people, then he returned from the baptism, who was the one who took them, and he took them as a Lord, and he took them.Yaqim, you are the injustice of yourself and for those who are unjust in the darkness: One of them: that you have been disclosed by the reward for the sake of peace.The second: that the injustice is the origins that are not in fulfillment, and there is no benefit, nor a harmful payment of no knowledge, neither knowledge nor kindness, so when they worshiped the hurry, they were the one who did not.It leads to forever The greatest of injustice, and for that he said: The evil is a great injustice [Laqman: 13] But this injustice is from its right to restrict it to the illusion that it does not deliver it to it.The injustice is what it excels, so he said: You have wronged yourself.As for his words, the Almighty said: The hurry is to be deleted, because they did not oppress themselves with this destiny because they did not take it (P-75) and he did not make it (P-75) Doing them injustice, so what is meant by taking the hurry is God, but when the verse of the verse was presented to this deleted, the good is good.As for his words, the Almighty: So you repent to your innocence, and kill yourself, and he has questions.The first question: His Excellency said: So you will repent to your innocence, and kill yourself, as it requires the color of the repentance, and it is an innocent of killing the soul, as is the saying of the soul.God accepts the prayer of one of you until the purification places its positions, and it will be washed and then destroyed.It is invalid because the repentance is a reflection of the regret for the ugly deed that has passed and the determination is that it does not come with the same after that, after that, and that is the end of the It is obligatory for him, so how is it permissible to explain it?.The answer is not intended to interpret the repentance by killing the soul, but rather that their repentance is not completed and does not get the same as killing the soul, but it was like that; Because God Almighty revealed to Moses, peace be upon him, that the condition of their repentance was killed the soul, as the murderer is a pillar that does not fulfill his repentance except by The guardians of the murderer or kill him, so it is not possible to be from the law of Moses, peace be upon him, that the repentance of the stretch is not fulfilled except by killing.If this is proven, then the condition of the thing may be called the name of that thing is permissible as it is said to the hastys if he intends to repent: if you do not repent.Your repentance is not fulfilled except with it, so it is so.The second question: What is the meaning of the Almighty saying: So you repent to your innocence and the repentance that only be for the burry?.And the answer: What is meant by it is forbidden from the lipstilation in the repentance, as if he said to them: If you appear the repentance, not from the heart, then you are what you are to God, who is the one People and that is what is not excessive in it, for you are if you are guilty of God.The third question: How is this position made by the remembrance of the innocent?.And the answer: The innocent is the one who created the creation, innocent of the recession: what you see in the creation of the Most Merciful from the recession [the king: 3] and distinguishes it from some of the forms The one who was the one who was alerted him to the one who was like that is the right to worship from the cows that the example is harmed in the stupidity.The fourth question: What is the difference between the fulfillment in its saying: So they repent and fulfill in its saying: Kill?.The answer: The first fulfillment of the causes; Because injustice is due to repentance, and the second is to punish, because the killing is from the perfection of repentance, so the meaning of his saying is: so you will repent, so follow the repentance To repent you.The fifth question: What is meant by saying: So kill yourself, what is required by his apparent that each one kills itself or what is meant?.The answer: The people differed in it, and the people of the interpreters said: It is not permissible for the person to be a matter of one of those who repent to kill his soul, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And begged him with two John: The first: He is the one who has assumed the people of interpretation that the interpreters gathered all that they did not kill them with their soul Thus, they are a blindfold by leaving that.The second: It is the judge, Abd al -Jabar, that the killing is the abuse of the structure that it must be released from it.A close or distant, but it was called a murder (P-76) is the metaphor.If you know the truth of the killing, then we say: It is not permissible for God to command the Almighty because the legitimate worshipers do not improve for them to be the goodness of it.مَصْلَحَةً إلّا في الأُمُورِ المُسْتَقْبَلَةِ ولَيْسَ بَعْدَ القَتْلِ حالُ تَكْلِيفٍ حَتّى يَكُونَ القَتْلُ مَصْلَحَةً فِيهِ وهَذا بِخِلافِ ما يَفْعَلُهُ اللَّهُ تَعالى مِنَ الإماتَةِ لِأنَّ That is from the action of God, so it is good for him to do it if it is good for another cost and compensate for that cost of the great rituals and the difference that God commands Suffice it or cut a member of its members, and the death does not get his punishment, because when he remained after that, the verb is not alive, and it is not forbidden that it is a good Acceptable.And whoever says: We do not surrender that the killing is a name for the tasty act of the spirit in the case, but rather is a phrase of the act that leads to al -Zuhuq, either in the case or by the one who is in the case or by it.If a person does not kill a person, then he would be hurt by a great surgery, and after that surgery, a single moment is a single moment, then he died, so he is in the right This language is fatal, and the origin of the right -standing recovery is indicated that the name of the killing is the name of the act that leads to the trustees, whether it led to it in the case or after you The arrival of the matter with the surgery that does not follow the decay immediately, and if it is also proven that the matter is wanted to kill the person himself For the soul immediately, why is it permissible and it is permissible for it?His saying: It is necessary in the arrival of it from the ultimate outlook, we said: First, we do not surrender that it is necessary in it from the reconciliation, and the evidence is that it is the one who is a peace He disbelieved in faith and no salvation in that, as there is no more than that of the deposit except for the punishment of punishment.The reconciliation is to him, and why it is not permissible to kill him himself as a reconciliation of others, then God Almighty commanded him to benefit from it, so that he will be blessed with that Great to him.Peace be upon us that it is necessary from the refined to it, but it is not permissible to say: His knowledge of his formation is a matter To kill himself tomorrow, then his knowledge of that becomes a call for him to leave the doves from that time to the roses of tomorrow, and if this is the one who said, what is the one who is the same The first face, which is the most powerful, and on this, it is obligatory to know the verse from its appearance, then it is in it.The disobedience is to kill each other, and he said it: Kill yourself with it to kill some of you, and it is like saying it in the place [Al -Nasi: 29] Its meaning does not kill some of you and fulfill it that the believers are like the same soul, and it was said in his saying: “Do not come to your soul” The believers, and in his saying: If not for you, you have heard it, the believers and the believers thought about them Peace be upon you [Al -Nur: 61], meaning to hand over each other.Then the interpreters said: Those who are repenting to the righteousness of two, and hit some of them to the night.The second face: that God is the highest of those who are repenting to kill those who are repentant, so that it is what is meant by his saying: kill your soul For the killing, and this second face is close to that in the first face, the hardship will be increased, because if the group is bought in the sin, some of them are more severe for the bit.On them, if they are charged with killing some of them, the hardships of that of that, then the narratives were dispersed: the first is that it is a matter of those who did not The deceased to attend the meeqaat to kill those who worshiped the hurry from them, and the murderers were seventy thousands, so what they moved until they were killed on three (P-77).Muhammad Ibn Ishaq mentioned it.The second: that when he commanded them, peace be upon him, by killing, they answered, and he took the charity to them to be patient with the killing, so they became a group of people Aaron in the twelve thousand people who did not worship the hurry and their hands are the sake, so the repentants said: These are your brothers, you have come to you.Fear God and be patient, and God cursed a man who rose from His Majesty Or extended his kindness to them or received them with a hand or a man who said safe, so they would kill them to the evening and Moses and Aaron rose upon them, peace be upon them.The rest of our God, and God Almighty revealed to them.The third: that the sons of Israel were two sections: Some of them worshiped the calf and among them who did not worship him, but he was not denied by those who worshiped him, so he did not know Whoever works with worship, then the interpreters said: The man was seeing his father, his child, and his neighbor, so he could not go to the command of God, so God, the Lord of God.Then he ordered the killing and killed to the evening until he called Moses and Aaron, peace be upon them, and they said: O Lord, have the children of the rest of the rest of the rest, and the rest of the time, and the sorrow of The coward of their hands fell.The sixth question: How did they fulfill the killing while they were repented from the response and the repentance of the response is not killed?.Answer: That is what is different from the partner, so that it may be a law that was upon him, peace be upon him, which was required to kill the repentant from the response, either in general in the right of the whole or if it is for the right.The seven question: Is it correct that it is narrated that some of them are not killed by whom God accepted his repentance?.Answer: It is not possible for that because his saying is up to the Almighty: You have been wronged by the discourse of his disclosure, so perhaps it was with the bone or that it was general, so the year has been over.As for his words, the Almighty: that is better for you, for your innocence, so that he will be alerted him to what is for what is for him, and this is the hardship of this, because it is the hardship of you, because it is the hardship of you.The harm of the world and the latter of the hereafter, and the first is the first to bear it because it is dead, and the latter of the hereafter is not dead, and because the death is not necessary, it is not in the case.And late, as for the salvation of punishment and the winner with the reward, then that is the greatest.As for his words, he said: He will be forgotten by him.Then it is in it, and it is: And the other: to be a discourse from God for them on the way of tafs, so the estimation will be, so you did what you have commanded in Moses, and you will be blessed with you.As for the meaning of his words, the Almighty is: He adopted you that he is the merciful repentance, so he was presented in his saying: He adopted that he is the merciful repentance.[Al -Baqara: 37]
