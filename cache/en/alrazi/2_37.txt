The researcher is the Almighty: So Adam receives from his Lord words, and he adopted upon him that he is the Most Merciful, in which the first question is: the first question: the lock is: Then it is placed in the position of the ritualization of the Great Shiites, then the place of acceptance and the taking is placed.Teach it.It is said: We gave us the arguments, that is, we received them.It is said: I received this word from so -and -so, that is, I took it from it.And if this was the origin of the word, and it was the one who met a man, then he met each one who accompanied it, so I will be added.I received him, so he met you, and he was done to say: Adam met the words, that is: he took it, took it, and received it with the acceptance, and it is permissible to say: the words of the words are met with the words of the words On the authority of God, the word, and the same is his saying: He does not obtain the covenant of the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 124] and in the readers of Ibn Mas'oud (the unjust).The second question: It is announced that it is not permissible for what is meant that God Almighty has known the truth of the repentance; Because the cost is inevitable and to know what the repentance is, and it is able to do it from your condemnation of sins and distinguishes it from others, for the sake of the Prophet, and the peace of the Prophet, It is obligatory to carry it on one of the things: one of them: the alerts on the disobedience that occurred from it on the face of the face of peace be upon him, when the two repentances.And the second: that it is the highest, it was known as the repentance of the repentance, and it is an acceptable acceptance that is not referred to the meaning that the one who sins is a young sin or a greatness, then the one who is not upon me, and he does not have to do.I repent to him.God Almighty said: So Adam received from his Lord words, that is, he took it, accepted it, and worked with it.And the third of it: It is the Almighty that he reminded him of his great blessings on him, so he became from the strong reasons to the repentance.And he pushed it: He attributed it to him, if the repentance was obtained with it, then that was a reason for the majesty of the state of repentance.* * * The third question: they disagreed that those words are what?So Saeed ibn Jubayr on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the peace be upon him, said: O Lord, did you not create me with your hand without a mediator?He said: Yes.He said: O Lord, did you not breathe in your soul?He said: Yes.He said: Didn't you live in your paradise?He said: Yes.He said: Lord, did you not precede your mercy?He said: Yes.He said: O Lord, if you have been repented and fixed me to Heaven?He said: He said, and he said: So Adam received from his Lord the words and increased the Saddi in it: O Lord, did you write a sin on me?He said: Yes.And the second: Al -Nakha’i said: Ibn Abbas came, and I said: What are the words that were received by Adam from his Lord?He said: God taught Adam and the passion of the pilgrimage, Hajja, which is the words that are said in the pilgrimage.The pilgrimage, may God Almighty revealed to them that I accepted your repentance.And the third of it: Mujahid and Qutdah said in one of the two narrators about them, which is his saying: Our Lord is our oppression of our souls, and if you do not forgive us and may God be forgiven, we are from the losers.And he pushed it: Said bin Jabir said on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them: It is his saying: There is no god but you are your pursuit of you and your praise, I have done badness and injustice You are the best of those who are unaware, there is no god but you, you will be greeted with you and your souls have done bad and my soul has forgotten me.There is no god but you, you will be blessed and with your praise, I have done badness and my soul has been wronged, so you will be upon me that you are the Most Merciful.Fifth: Aisha said when God wanted to repent on Adam, he walked around the house seventy, and the house is the day of the Lord of Hamra, and when he prayed, he said: You know my secret and my admiration, accept my excuse and know my need, so give me my question, and I know what is in myself, forgive me my sins.Oh God, I ask you a faith that preaches my heart and protects honestly until I know that he will only suffer me from what I have written for me and satisfied with what you divided into me.So God Almighty revealed to Adam: O Adam, I have forgiven you for your sin, and no one of your offspring will come to you, so let me pray for me, and I have called me, and I have called me, and I have called me, and I have called me His domination and his thoroughness, and I was removed from the poverty from his eyes, and the world came to him, and he did not want it.* * * The loyal question: Al -Ghazali, may God have mercy on him, said: The repentance is achieved from three things that are arranged, knowledge, condition, and work, for the first, and the first, and the first, It is obligatory for the second, and the second is obligatory for the third positive that the Sunnah of God (P-20) in the king and the king, but the science is known to what is in the sin of the vow The servant and the mercy of the Lord, so if he knows a savage knowledge, he obtained from this definition, the heart hurts the causes The loved one is painful, and if his missed deeds do from his face, he regretted the causes of the love of the loved one, which was the reason for that, so that the slope of that is the goodness of that.Then, if that is the pain, if it is confirmed that there is a firm will, and it is related to the situation, the future, and the past, but it is related to it, then it is the same In the future, the determination is to leave that deed that is died for the loved one to the last age.As for the past, the difference is what you missed with mighty and the judiciary, if it is to be forced, then the knowledge is the first and it is the one who follows these good deeds, and I mean it to the one who is complete, that this is the one who is the one.This is a light of light, and this light requires the fire of regret, and the heart will be p A veil about his loved ones as the light of the sun was burned, and he was in injustice, and the light is brought up to him by the clouds, so he saw the hearts of the sake So the flames of love in his heart are scattered, and it will be sent from that fire.For the past three with the arrival of the arrival (on the repentance).The name of the repentance is called the whole of its entirety and many are called the name of the repentance on the meaning of the denomination and alone, and it makes the precedent knowledge like the ritual and the ritual The late, and with this advertisement, peace be upon him said: With his two parties, he means his fruit and his fruit, for this is the one who summarized the Sheikh Al -Ghazali in the truth of the repentance, and it is a good words.Al -Qaflal said: It is necessary to repent from the leaving of that sin, and from the regret on what was before and from the determination that he does not return to the example of it, and from the horizons of that, there is no one in it.From the blessing, because if he was not left, he would not have been active for him, so he would not be a repentant, and as for the regret, he would not have been regretted if he was not satisfied with him, and he was satisfied with him, and he is the one who is satisfied with him, He does it and the act of the thing is not a repentant for him, but the determination is that he does not return to the like, because his action is disobedient, and the determination is upon the disobedience Because he is commanded by the repentance, and there is no reason for him to the piece that he came with the repentance, as he was obliged, and he would be disappointed.9] And peace be upon him said: “If the fear of the believer was decorated and his hope was not accustomed to“, ”and he knew that the words of Al -Ghazali, may God have mercy on him, and enter the A problem, which is that knowledge is the formation of the action, the inherent is a harm with the knowledge that that action is a source of it, it is necessary for the heart to be hurt, and that is the one who is in order The avoidance of what was obtained from it in the past, and if some of these things are arranged for some, a warning arrange With it.It is happening that the inside in the expansion is not only the knowledge of the knowledge, but what is meant is not for the choice to a path, but it is a saying that he says: Because the knowledge is obtained by some of the unidentified, it can only be by the mediation of the information advanced on that face; So that the present scientists who are arrested by that of that unknown are either being obligated to know that unknown or not.If the first was the arrangement of the arrogant to him The argument with him is a fierce, so this is not within the ability and the choice, and if the second was not the one who is the one who is unaware of the one who is the one Because the proceedings are the proximity that must be in any way that is required of its saints in the mind, the one who is called, then if you are not like that, then you are not the same.A result of this result.So (P-21) was said: Why is it not permissible to say: Those of the advances, even if you are present in the mind, except that how to communicate with it to that is the result, so there is no need A crime that does not have to know that the science of the science is not a matter of referrals?We said: Knowledge of the way of connecting it to that resurrection, either that it is from the beginnings or from the corners, if it is from the beginnings, it is not in the end of it; And if it is one of the corners, it was the saying in the entity of its acquisition as it is in the first, then it is led to the seizure while it is referred, or it is referred to until it becomes from the palace of it.Male, and God knows.* * * The fifth question: The judge asked Abd al -Jabar himself and he said: If this disobedience is a young, then how is the obligatory obligatory?He replied that Abu Ali said: It is obligatory for him because the cost is what he knew that he had disobeyed, and he did not limit after after, and he is a choice and is not forbidden to be a nurse A dignity, so do not fulfill its parties for this ugly, except by repentance.It is passed.As for Abu Hashem, it is permissible to empty the disobedience from the repentance and the righteousness and say: It is not valid for the repentance to be a duty to the prophets, because this is the face of this A duty to one of the two, either to answer; Because the minor, we have shortened their rewards, so that the deficiency is returned with the repentance; Either because the repentance is a slogan of the tender, then if the leaving is obligatory when the place, then it is imperative that the repentance must be with the abundance of the place, and it may have said: The hearing, and this is the most correct of his saying; Because the repentance is not permissible to respond to the reluctance of the reward, which is the benefit of the only; Because the verb is not permissible for the sake of the boundary to the sake of the benefits, as the fools do not answer, but the Prophet, peace be upon them.The tension on them in the repentance after a state, even if their transgression is young.* * * The sixth question: Al -Qaflal said: The origin of the domestication is like a wip, it is said: Tawab as it is said: Ob, God Almighty said: Tawaba, repentance, and repentance, as it is repentant and repentant, such as their saying: a father, a heart, a lord and a repent In it the Lord and the servant, if the servant is described with it, then the meaning is returned to his Lord; Because every sinner is in the sense of righteousness from his Lord, then if he repents, he will return from his Lord to his Lord, and he said: He repented to his Lord, and the Lord in this case is like a slave, and he is like this.The Lord is exalted.And in the Lord on his servant, and the man may separate the servant of a president, and the president cuts his favor at him, then he will return his servant, and he said: With his feelings and his knowledge, if you know this, then we say: the acceptance of the repentance will be in Jahin: one of them: that the great reward is given to it.The second: It is the Almighty, his sins are forgiven by the causes of repentance.* * * The following question: What is meant by the description of God is the Almighty, the exaggeration in the acceptance of the repentance, and that is from two faces: the first: that one of the angels of the world He apologized to him, as he accepts the apology, then if he returns to crime and to the apology again, then he does not accept him; Because his bowl prevented him from the acceptance of excuse, but God is His Glory to Him and Him, then he is with disagreement (P-22) that is that he accepts the repentance, not to the command of a matter He walked a benefit or pays a harm, but rather accepts it for the satisfaction of charity and preference.God Almighty forgives what has been a predecessor and accepts his repentance, so he fulfilled an attribute of the language in the acceptance of the repentance, and he will be described.The second: that those who repent to God are the Almighty, for it is many of their number, so if it is accepted by the comprehensive repentance It requires the reward for the reward, and the reward was from his face as a blessing and mercy, and he described himself with his being, as he was merciful.* * * The eighth question: In this verse, the first: The first is the first: that the servant must be occupied by the repentance in every time and time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, for the time, As for the hadiths (a), it was narrated that a man asked the one who believed in the believers, may God be pleased with him, from the man, and he will be forgiven, then he asks for forgiveness, then he will be forgiven Then he asks for forgiveness, and the Commander of the Faithful said: He will never be forgiven until the Satan is the loser, and he says: There is no energy for me with him, and he said to me: Put and get rid of it, do.(B) Abu Bakr al -Siddiq narrated, may God be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “He did not assume those who seek forgiveness, and if he returned on the day seven times.” (C) On the authority of Ibn Omar, he said: He said to him Prayer and peace: "Repent to your Lord, and I repent to him every day a hundred times." (D) Abu Hurairah said: “Prayer and peace be upon him, when he was revealed to him: And the closest tenth About you from God, O Abbas Bin Abd Al -Muttalib, I will not sing from you from God, something, O class of the aunt of the Messenger of God, I will not sing from you, O God Ask me, what you want, I do not sing from you from God, "" the other in the correctness.(E) And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “He will be overwhelmed by my heart, so God forgive God in the day.” And know that the rich thing is the heart of the heart, and it covers it with some coverage, and it is like a delicate deity that is exposed in the atmosphere, so it does not veil from the sun, and it is like the sun, and it is like the sun.Remember to this hadith interpretations: the one of them: that God is upholstered by his Prophet on what he is in his nation after his disagreement and what he afflicts, so if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he said, then if he is the same He forgiven his nation.And the second: He was peace and blessings be upon him, and he was transferred from one condition to a state that raised from the first, so the forgiveness was for that.And the third of it: that the cloud is a expressive of the sugar that was attached to it in the way of love until it becomes a matter of himself in the whole, then if he returns to the authority, then he returns to the authority of the good Sahwa, which is the interpretation of the righteousness of the truth.And the one who is sealed: It is the interpretation of the people of the phenomenon that the heart does not disassemble the dangers, the dangers, the desires, the types of miles, and the wills, so they would seek the Lord of the Lord.(F) Abu Hurairah said: Omar, may God be pleased with him, said in his saying, the Almighty: they repent to God, a righteous repentance.He does not return, and Ibn Masoud said, may God be pleased with him: is that the sin will be abandoned and determined to never return to it.(G) The Messenger of God ﷺ said about God Almighty: He says to his angels: In the bad, so do it, and write it one bad thing, so if you leave it, then write it for him good."It was narrated by Muslim.(H) It was narrated that Gabriel, peace be upon him, heard his wasting, peace be upon him, saying: O generous pardon, so Jabriel said: Or do you know what is the generous of forgiveness?He said: No, Gabriel.(P-23) He said: To pardon the bad and write it good.(I) Abu Hurairah, upon him, peace and blessings be upon him,: Sins.(J) On the authority of Abu Saeed Al -Khadri, he said: He said: “It was before you A man who killed nine and a ninetic soul, and he asked about the knowledge of the people of the earth, so he referred to a monk, and he came to him, so he said that he had killed nine and a nine Tabbah?He said: No, he killed him, and he completed the hundred.Then he asked about the knowledge of the people of the land, and he referred to a world of a man, and he came to him, so he said that he killed a hundred souls, so did I have a repentance?And he said: Yes, and whoever turns between you and between the repentance, go to the ground like this, and so, for you are people who worship God, and worship Him with them, and do not return to them He went out until the half of the way came, and the death came to him, and the angels of the mercy and the angels of the torment were stigmatized in it, so the angels of the mercy said: God Almighty.The angels of torment said: He did not do the best of all.So a king came to them in the image of Adami and was broken between them, and he said: They measured what is between the two lands So the angel of the mercy was arrested.“It was narrated by a Muslim (oh) Ali and his son, and God said: “I have made their breasts to be silent for you”.He said: Lord, increase me.He said: You will run from it.He said: Lord, increase me.He said: And you will be blessed with your horses and your leg and share them in the money and children [Al -Israa: 64], he said: So he complained of Adam Absis to his Lord, and he said: O Lord, he said: Oh, and he said: And among him is an enmity and a hatred and his authority over me and my atoms and I do not tolerate him except with you, so God Almighty said: You are not born to you, and I have a son who has been given to him.He said: Lord, increase me.He said: Al -Hassan is twenty.He said: Lord, increase me.He said: I do not veil from one of your children the repentance that has not been deceived.The day and the night, to repent the atheist at night until the sun is looked at from its strangeness."It was narrated by a Muslim.(It is on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, who said: If I heard from the Messenger of God ﷺ a hadith, God benefited me from him from what he wanted, then he will help me I was inhabited, so if I am true to me, and Abu Bakr spoke to me and the father of Bakr was charity, he said: I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ He said: “There is no servant who is a servant Establishment, then he will rise, and he will pray for two knees, and God will forgive God, except for his forgiveness.Then read: And those who, if they did, are obscene or wronged themselves to his saying: So ask forgiveness for their sins [Al -Baqarah: 135].(Hand) The father of Imamah said: “We are sitting with the Messenger of God ﷺ when a man came to him He said: O Messenger of God, I have become a limit and set up it on me.He said: So he was subjected to him, then he returned, and he said, like that, and the prayer was established, and the Messenger of God entered ﷺ So he prayed, then he came out.And the man follows him and says: O Messenger of God, I have become a limit and set up it on me, and he said to him, peace be upon him: I am a messenger, he said: You witnessed this prayer?A man to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of God, I have made a woman from the maximum city and that I have become water without touching her, for I am the one who has been in what you want, so he said to him, so he said: If you would seek yourself, then the Messenger of God did not return anything, then the man’s shrine, and he divorced him, and the Prophet called him ﷺ and this is the ritual of this verse: The night is that the goodness goes to the secrets [Hood: 114].One of the people said: O Prophet of God, this has a special one, he said: Rather, people are general.”Narrated (P-24) a Muslim.O Lord, I have sinned, so forgive me, and his Lord said: He knew my servant that he has a Lord who forgives sins and takes him, so he will be forgiven, then he will be forgiven.And he said: O Lord, I have sinned for another sin, so forgive him, and his Lord said: My servant knows that he has a Lord who forgives the sin and takes it to him, so he will be forgiven.Then he hit another sin and said: O Lord, I have sinned, and he forgive him, and his Lord said: He knew my servant that he has a Lord, who is forgiven for him, and he said: I forgive my servant, so let him do what he wanted.Once.They are asking, and they seek forgiveness, and they will be forgiven, and a Muslim narrated it.Something that he has fulfilled and said: O Messenger of God, I passed the hatred of a tree, and I heard in it the voices of a dumpling shout, so I took them, so I was placed in it, so I was placed in it.His mother was turned on my head, and I revealed to her for them, and their mother signed them, so they wrapped them all in my fast, so he said: They put them from you, and they put them, so their mother refused to be obligated to them, so peace be upon him, and peace be upon him: [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your
