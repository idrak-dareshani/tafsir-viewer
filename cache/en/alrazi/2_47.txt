The researcher of the Quranic, his righteousness, and the Almighty: O sons of Israel, remember my blessing that I have bestowed on you and that I preferred you over the worlds.تَوْكِيدًا لِلْحُجَّةِ عَلَيْهِمْ وتَحْذِيرًا مِن تَرْكِ اتِّباعِ مُحَمَّدٍ ﷺ ثُمَّ قَرَنَهُ بِالوَعِيدِ, وهو قَوْلُهُ: واتَّقُوا يَوْمًا [البقرة: 48] كَأنَّهُ قالَ: إنْ لَمْ تُطِيعُونِي لِأجْلِ I want to bless you, so obey me to fear from my punishment in the future.As for his saying: And I prefer you over the two worlds, and he has a question, which is that it is necessary to be better than Muhammad, peace be upon him, and that is false, and the answer is from it.A people said: The world is a phrase for many people from the people as your saying: I saw a world of people, and it is intended from the many, not all, and this is weak; Because the scholar was derived from the science, which is evidence, all that was a sign of God Almighty was a world, so it was from the world, and this is the right to say the one who is the one who is the one who said: So God, and on this, it is not possible to specialize in some events.Second: What is meant, I preferred you over my world.And that is because the person who will find after that, and now it is not in a way that was not for that person from the whole world of the world.Because the one who stipulates the world is that it is a feed and the thing is the state of its numbers, it is not a fence, for the woman is the state of its numbers, it is not from the two worlds, and that the praise of the peace be upon him.That time, for what was time from the two worlds, then it is not necessary than the children of the children of the best of the two worlds in that time The answer is also about his saying: He made a prophet in you and made you angel and brought you what no one of the two worlds was given [Al -Ma’idah: 20] and he said: And we have chosen them on the knowledge of the knowledge With it, my world of that time, but they were better than other than what they were given from the king, mission, and divine books.The two worlds, but it is divorced in the grace and the divorced, is enough for it to be one of it The best of all worlds in all matters, but perhaps they, and if they are better than others in one matter The recipient is reconciled with the Almighty saying: God has seized Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of Amran on the two worlds [Al -Imran: 33] that the Prophet is better.He remained research: the first search: Ibn Zaid said: He wanted him: the believers of them; Because their sticks are dirty and swine of what he said: He made them a monkey and the swine of them [Table: 60] And he said: Those who disbelieved from the children of Israel were cursed [Al -Ma’idah: 78].The second research: that all of what God has addressed to the sons of Israel, a warning to the Arabs; Because the guidance of the Prophet has attached them to them, and all the farms of the prophets alerted him and a guidance, God Almighty said: Those who listen to the saying: Follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord [Al -Zumar: 55] and he said: He was in their stories a cross for the first of the doors [Joseph: 111] and that was narrated that he said: The speech used to say: God has passed, and God has the children of Israel and what enriches what you hear about others.The third research: The lock said: “The blessing” by breaking the nun of the noun and what the man is blessed with on his owner.The noun is what is blessed with it in the living.Reconciliation is not obligatory to God, nor in the world, nor in religion; Because his saying: And that I prefer you over the two worlds, all the blessings of the world and the religion, then that is the preference of either that it is obligatory, or it is not obligatory.Make him a blessing to them; Because whoever performs is obligatory, then he has no one to him, and if it is not obligatory with it, he has the highest devoted to some of that without some, so this is indicated that it is not the same Not in religion.If it was said: When he specializes in the great blessings in the world, then this is appropriate for them to be specialized in the great blessings in the hereafter as it was said: “Tammam al -Ma’ar I add to that severity in his saying: Fear a day?The answer: Because disobedience is with the greatness of the burden, it will be the ugliness and the throat of this, so this warned them of it.Fifth Research: In Bayan, that a group of the world is better, meaning that any of them is more unanimous in the communities of good, know that this is what is in which the righteousness is made, Each sect claims that it is better and more unanimous in the affiliations of the blasphemy and we are referring to the holding of the words in this section by fulfilling God Almighty.
