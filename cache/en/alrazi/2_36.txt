The researcher of the Quranic, the glory of it, is glorified and exalted: So the Satan was removed from it, so he brought them out of what they were in, and we said, “Give you some of the enemy, and you are in the land of the land.The scout: So the Satan is removed from it, and it will be fulfilled, so the Satan issued their abandonment from it, and for the sake of (on the authority of) in this verse as it is in the saying of it: 82] The lock, may God have mercy on him, said: It is from the shame.The disappearance of the place, and it was narrated from my father, Muhah, that he said: It is said that I removed you from such that until you were removed from it, and I have removed you until you were removed, and one of it is one, that is, it is: The Satan is removed, i.E., they are unbroken, so it is from your saying: He was removed in his debt if he makes a mistake, and remove him other than him if he causes him what is still for him in his debt or his world.And know that in the verse there are: (the first question): People disagreed in the infallibility of the Prophet, peace be upon them, and the saying is connected to it to be said: the difference in this door is in this door Four: One of them: What is located in the chapter of the belief.And the second: What is located in the chapter of Tablig.And the third: What is located in the chapter of rulings and sects.And its lifespan: What falls in their actions and their paths.As for their disbelief and misguidance, that is not permissible when the nation is more.Al -Fadiliya said from the Kharijites: They have signed sins, and the sin has disbelief and evil, so they did not say they said the fell of the disbelievers of them, and the imams of them, and the imams of them, The infidelity is on the way of piety.As for the second type: which is related to the tablig, the nation has gathered on their eyes as they are informatives from the lie and the burning, so that it is commented, so it is commented The trustee is performing, and they agreed on that that it is permissible to fall from them, as it is not permissible as well maybe.As for the third type: which is related to the veil, they gathered on the fact that it is not permissible for their mistakes in it on the path of baptism, but on the way of the sake Other.On the side of the baptism, which is the saying of the wing.The second: The saying of those who are not permitted to them, but the listeners are permitted on the side of the baptism, except what is alienated like the liar and the liar, and this is the same Displaced.The third saying: that it is not permissible to come with a minor or a greatness on the side of the baptism, but rather on the one hand, and it is the saying of the Jabai.The righteous saying: that the sin does not fall from them except on the authority of the And mistake, but they are taken from what happened to them on this side, even if that is a subject of their nation; This is because their knowledge is stronger and their evidence is more, and that they are able to keep on what is not appreciated by others.The fifth saying: that there is no sins, neither the oldest nor the young, nor on the way of intention, nor on the way of the sacrifice, nor on the path of interpretation, and the sin, And the people in the time of the infallibility differed on three sayings: one of them: the saying of those who went to the fact that they are informed who are the time of their birth, which is the saying of the rejectionist.And the second: the saying of those who went until they were their silence, and they did not allow them and did not allow them to commit the disbelief and the great before the prophecy, and it is the saying of many.And the third of it: the saying of those who went until that is not permissible at the time of the Prophet, but before the prophecy is permissible, and it is the saying of the most of our companions and the saying of the father of the father of the father.And the choice for us that there was no prophecy of the replacement, not the oldest, nor the small, and it is indicated by it: Driver of the nation’s disobedience, and that is not permissible, the mandate of the mandate is that the grace of the prophet was in the end of the majesty and the honor, and everyone who was like that was the ritual of the righteousness You see the words of the Almighty: the Prophet of the Prophet who comes from you with a clear obscenity that is doubled by the torment of two weaknesses, [Al -Ahzab: 30] and the fortified, and the one who is murdered, The extent of the freedom, but it is not permissible for the Prophet to be less than the nation, so that by consensus.And secondly: that the ability to take it on immorality must not be the acceptance of martyrdom; To say the Almighty: If a pasture comes to you with a prophet, then show [Al -Hujurat: 6] but it is the acceptance of the testimony, otherwise it was less than the nation of the nation, and how is it not.For the prophet and the message, except that he testifies to God Almighty that he has legalized this judgment and that, and also, it is the Day of Resurrection a witness to all; To say it: To be a testimony on people, and the Messenger will be a martyr upon you [Al -Baqarah: 143].And the third of it: that it is able to do its feet on the great, it is obligatory for its mine from it, so it was not forbidden, but it is forbidden; To say the Almighty: Those who harm God and His Messenger, may God curse them in the world and the hereafter [Al -Ahzab: 57].And he seized it: that Muhammad ﷺ if he came to disobey, he would have to feed him in it; To say to him: Follow me, and it will lead to the gathering between the sanctity and the duty, and it is referred, and if you prove that in the right of Muhammad, it is also established in the sake Dakah.Fifth: We know the beginning of the mind that there is nothing more ugly than a prophet.His worshipers and his country hear his Lord calling him: Do not do so, so he will be presented to him as a risk of his pleasure, and it is not satisfied with the end of his Lord.This is the science of ugliness with the harm.And its sixth: that if the disobedience was issued from the prophets, they would be deserved to the torment; To say to him: And whoever disobeys God (P-9) and his Messenger, then he has the fire of hell, immortalized in it [Al-Jin: 23] The nation gathered that one of the prophets was not affected by the curse, nor for the torment, so you have proven that the disobedience was issued.And the seven of it: that they were commanding people with the obedience of God, and if they would not obey Him, they would have entered it under his saying: Do you command the people with the righteousness, and you will be blessed Do you not understand [Al -Baqarah: 44] and he said: What I want to violate you to what I am forbidden is from it [Hood: 88], so what is not appropriate for the one who is preached to the nation, how is it permissible to be attributed to the Prophet.And the eighth: His Exalted, the Almighty, said: They were hurrying in the goodness [Al -Anbiya: 90], and the good of the good is memorized, so all of them are used, and he will enter into it, and he does not have what he does not want, She proven that the prophet was active for everything that he does, his actions and volunteers, everything that is emptied of his blessing, and that contradicts the breasts of sins from them.And the ninth: His Excellency said: They are for us from the two selective selection [p.47], and this is the whole of all verbs and your rituals with the same way The two oaths are only in the inhabitant act, and the discretion is removed from the words, what God had to enter under it, so it was proven that they were a choice in all the affairs Sins for them.And he said: God selects from the angels a messenger and from the people [Hajj: 75], God has chosen Adam and Noah and the family of Abraim and the family of Amran on the two worlds [Al -Imran: 33].And he said in Ibrahim: We have seized it in the world [Al -Baqarah: 130].And he said in Moses: I have chosen you on people with my messages and my words [Al -A'raf: 144].And he said: And remember our worshipers, Abraham, and Isaac, and the first of the hands and the eyes, we have made them clear with a male of the house, and they are for us from the one.All of these verses are indicative of their essences with the elaboration and goodness, and that contradicts the breasts of sins from them.Her lived: He was transcended from his saying: So, I will beg you, but they are all, except for your servants from them The two are the ones who are the prophets, peace be upon them.He said in the adjective of Abraham, Ishaq and Jacob: We have made them with a clergy of the house of the house [p.46] and said in Yusuf: It is one of our servants, and the one who is in the authority of Joseph: 24] The right of some has proven and answered in the right of all; Because he does not say Dakah.And Al -Wadi is twenty: His Excellency said: And he believed that he thought that they only followed him with a group of believers [Saba: 20], so those who are not those who are not.The sin is for them, otherwise they were followed by it, and if it is proven in that partial that they are not the same, then that of the jurisprudence is either the prophet or others, then they are in the The Prophet is that it is not sought, and if they were not the prophet, if it is established in the prophets that they were sled, they would have been less cherigated by God than that of the juris The Prophet, and that is void with the agreement, has proven that the sin was what was issued by them.The second is ten: It is the highest division of the creation.However, the party of God is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does the party that does what the Satan is shown by, and the one who is shown by the Satan The exalted was from the party of Satan, and if the disobedience was issued from the Messenger, he believed that he (P-10) is from the Satan party, and he is true to him.The nation is that they are from the party of God, and that they are from the two, so that this is the one from the nation, more than many of God, from that of the Messenger, and this is not the Messenger, The third is ten: The Messenger is better than the king, so it is not obligatory for the sake of the Messenger not to be issued, but we said: It is better; To say: God has chosen Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of Amran on the two worlds [Al -Imran: 33], and the direction of the recipient of it is the same Bosurus, but we said: It was not like that, the sin does not come from the Messenger; Because he is upholstered and described the angels by leaving the sin, and he said: They do not precede him by saying [Al -Anbiya: 27] and he said: They do not disobey God, what they commanded and do what they do: The disobedience is from the Messenger to prevent his being more than the king; To say it to the Almighty: Or do we make those who believe and do righteousness like the spoilers in the land, or do we make the righteous like the displaced [p.28].The fourth is the tenth: It was narrated.I believe you on the revelation of you from the seventh of the heavens.Approximately on the prophets, that testimony is permissible.The fifteenth: He said in the right of Abraham, peace be upon him: I make you an imam [Al -Baqarah: 124] and the imam who is entrusted People are to take care of him, so if the sin was issued for him, they must have to take care of it in that sin, and that is required to contradict it.The sixth is the same: His Excellency said: He does not obtain the covenant of the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 124] and what is meant by this covenant is either the era of the prophecy or the era of the imam, for if it was The prophethood does not prove to those who are unjust, and if what is meant is the era of the imamate, the imamate must not be proven to the perseverance, and if the imam is not proven to the imamate, the imam is not proven to the oppressors.The prophecy of the unjust, because every prophet must be an imam who is entrusted with and imitated.* * * And the verse is on all the ability to indicate that the Prophet is not a sinner.We refer to its holding, and we are referring to the exclusion of what will come in this interpretation if God Almighty wills.As for the verses that they are held in the chapter on the belief, the first: the first: they are held by stabbing in the belief of Adam, peace be upon him.And he made her husband to live in [Al -A'raf: 189] to the last of the verse.They said: There is no doubt that the single soul is Adam, and its created husband is a passion for it, so these creatures are with their families, which are given to them, so he said: So God Almighty is what they share [Al -Araf: 190] requires the breasts of the polytheism from them, and the answer: We do not surrender that the single soul is Adam and is not in the verse of what is clear.For the Quraysh, who are a storyteller, and the meaning created you from the soul of my story and made from its gender an Arabic wife to be dwelling to it, so when I came to them, they did not ask for the righteousness The fourth with the servant of Manaf, Abd al -Azzi, Abd al -Dar and Abd al -Qasi, and the guarantee in their partnership and their punishment, so this answer is the one.(P-11).And the second: They said: Abraham, peace be upon him, was not aware of God, nor on the other day.As for the first, because he said in Al -Kawakib: This is my Lord [Al -Anam: 77].The answer is: As for his saying: This is my Lord, he is an understanding of the path of denying, and his saying: But he will reassure my heart, so what is meant is that it is not like.And the third of it: Hold it with the words of the Almighty: If you are in doubt what we have revealed to you, then ask those who read the book before you, then you have come The ritual [Yunus: 94], and the verse was indicated that Muhammad was in doubt of what was revealed to me.The answer is that the heart in the home of the world is not removed from the hurrying ideas of the young people, except that he was praying and peace be upon him.As for the verses that Hold it in the chapter on the Tablig, and three: one of them: its saying: We will read you, so do not forget except what God wills [Al -Ala: 6].It is not forbidden for the forgetfulness, which is against the remembrance, because that is not within the sake of expansion, but rather from the forgetfulness in the sense of the leaving, so we will be blessed.And the second: His saying: And what we sent before you from a messenger or a prophet unless he hopes to receive the Satan in his wish [Hajj: 52], and the words are mentioned in the authority of the Hajj.And the third of it: His Excellency said: The scholar of the unseen, so no one will appear on his absence, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger, for he asks you from his hands and from his hands.[27] They have informed the messengers of their Lord [Al -Jin: 28].With them, it is more.The answer is: Why is it not permissible for the good to be pushed by that monitoring, those who are in the face of the boss.As for the verses that they were held in the fate, three, one of which is: its saying: Dadd and Silman, when he is governed by the plow [Al -Anbiya: 78], and you have spoken to us in Sora.And the second: His saying in Asiri, when the Prophet did not understand them, ﷺ would not have been for him to have captives until he was thickened in the land [Al -Anfal: 67], and if not for him to make it wrong When he was repeated, and the third: His Exalted, may God forgive you, why did you give permission to them [Repentance: 43], and the answer to all: We carry it on the first leaving.As for the verses that they are held in the actions, the first of which is: the story of Adam, peace be upon him.The major, but we said: He was a disobedient for his saying: He disobeyed Adam, his Lord, and he was fake [Taha: 121].Punished; To say to him: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, then he has the fire of hell [Al -Jin: 23], so there is no meaning for the owner of the great, except for that.The second: that the disobedient is the name of defamation, so it is obligatory that only the great owner.The second direction in holding the story of Adam was that he was a heavy; To say it to the exalted: it is absent [Taha: 121] and the absence against the adult; To say it to the Almighty: The adult was shown from the absence [Al -Baqarah: 256], so he made the absence an interview for adults.The third face: it is repentant and the repentant is a sinner, but we said: It is repentant; To say to him: So, Adam received from his Lord words, and he was repented to him [Al -Baqarah: 37] and he said: Then his Lord answered him, and he was repeated upon him [Taha: 122], but he said: Because the repentance (P-12) is the supporter of the act of sins, and the call for the verb of sins is an expert from his being, the verb of sins, so if you lie in that He is a sinner of lies, and if he believes in it, he is the one who is required.The loud face: He committed the one who has been in his saying: Did you not exhaust this tree [Al -A'raf: 22], and do not come close to this tree [Al -A'raf: 19] Eye of sins.Fifth face: He called him an unjust in his saying: So you will be among the unjust [Al -Baqarah: 35] and he called himself unjust in his saying: Our Lord is our oppression: Full; To say the Almighty: The curse of God is on the oppressors [Hood: 18] and whoever deserves the curse was the great owner.The sixth face: He was recognized that if not the forgiveness of God, he is not a loser in his saying: If you did not forgive us and may God be forgiven for us.Thus, it is required as the great owner.And the sake of it: that it was brought out of paradise with the reason for the Satan and its shadow is a reward for what I have provided for from the obedience of the Satan, and that is the same as the one who said: Give that every one of this face does not indicate his being an act of great, but its entirety is not doubted in his place in the semant One of these faces, even if it does not indicate something, but the group of those faces is indicative of something.And the answer to the seventh faces when we say: Your words are only if you fulfill if you are in the way that it was the state of the prophecy, and there is no It is said: The hand of peace be upon him, if this is the time for it, what was a prophet; Then after that he became a prophet?We have shown us that there is no indication of this place.وأمّا الِاسْتِقْصاءُ في الجَوابِ عَنْ كُلِّ واحِدٍ مِنَ الوُجُوهِ المُفَصَّلَةِ فَسَيَأْتِي إنْ شاءَ اللَّهُ تَعالى عِنْدَ الكَلامِ في تَفْسِيرِ كُلِّ واحِدٍ مِن هَذِهِ الآياتِ.Let us remember this, how is this zalal to appear to appear, God Almighty said: So the Satan removes them, so we will say: Let us be the same Peace after the prophecy, then its progress is on that action, either that it is the state of his being asleep or the state of his being is memory, but the first: that he did a person who did not say The one who spoke to him and begged him with his words: and we did not find him with determination [Taha: 115] and they represented him with the fasts, he will be tempted by the matter Sahi about fasting and eating in the past of that good [no] from a intention, this is not said by void from two sides: the first: that his saying is up to the Almighty: what is your Lord, what is your Lord, what is your Lord of this Malikin [Al -A'raf: 20], and his saying: And their divorce is that I am for those who advise [Al -A'raf: 20] indicates that he has not forgotten the state of adherence.It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, which indicates that peace be upon him was baptized because he said when they were eaten and it appeared For them, Adam came out, and a tree of heaven was attached to him, so I was loved by him, and God called him, so he said, and he said: Rather, he said: I gave you from paradise, which is forbidden by what I forbade you?He said: My Lord, but I and I, I did not see you, I saw that one of you is a liar, so he said: And I am pronounced, so I would like you to do so, and then you will only get lived.The second: It is that if he was a people, he would not have been done on that action, but from where the mind is because the people are unable to do the action, so it is not a cost of it; For his saying: God does not cost a soul except its capacity [Al -Baqarah: 286].Indicate that this was not a path (P-13).Because we say: As for the answer to the first, it is that we do not surrender that Adam and a passion before the Bellis of that speech and do not believe it in it; Because if they had believed it, their disobedience was in this belief greater than the whole tree; Because Ebis, when he said to them: We did not forbid you for this tree, except that you are owners or you are from the creators [Al -A'raf: 20], then they will be given to them.He left the greeting of his command and satisfaction with his judgment, and until they are accommodated in it as a righteous, as advised to them, and that the Lord is up to them, they have been cheated, and there is no doubt that this is the one who is a doubt that this is the one who is a doubt that this The tree, so the wandering should be more severe, and also, the peace be upon him, a scholar of the uninteresting of the prostration of prostration and his unprepared for him God is from blessings, so how is it permissible from the sane person to accept the saying of his enemy with these readers, and it is not in the verse that they are on the authority of that of the verb, or for that of the verb of the verb of the verb of the verb, It indicates that Adam was a scientist with his enemies; To say to the Almighty: This is an enemy for you and your husband, so do not leave you from paradise, and you will be taught [Taha: 117].As for what was narrated from Ibn Abbas, it is a bitter effect on the ones, so how does the Qur’an oppose?As for the answer to the second: it is that the blame is based on the blessing of the preservation of the causes of the forgetfulness, and this is a crushing from the authority of the one who is the one who is a person who was the one who has been given to the Muslims, With it, and it is not in the place of the prophets for the greatness of their danger, and it is represented by the words With a clear obscenity, the torment is doubled by two parties [Al -Ahzab: 30] and peace and blessings be upon him, and peace be upon him: He also said: “I am your death, as the man is given to you from you.” It is said how it is permissible to affect the greatness Without the cost of others?We said: As for you, you heard: “The best of the righteous is the bodies of those close to the prophet.This is in the report that he was issued by Adam, peace be upon him, on the one hand and forgetting.And I saw in some of the interpretations that the passion of the wine was made until he sugar and then in the thief of sugar, so he did so.They said: This is not far; Because he was peace be upon him, he was hurt by him in the entry of all things except for that tree, so if we carry the tree on righteousness, it was permissible in the time Heaven's wine does not sustain; To say it to the transcendence of the wine of paradise: there is no money in it [Al -Saffat: 47].As for the second saying: It is that peace be upon him, he did it in general, so we are four sayings: The first saying: that that is forbidden, and it was forbidden, and it is not forbidden.The saying and his reason.The second saying: that it was a baptism of the peace of peace be upon him, and that was great with the fact that Adam, peace be upon him, was in that time a prophet, and this is the same.The third saying: He was peace be upon him, and he did a pillar, but he was with him from the man, the fear and the agreement, what happened to that in the ruling of the young, and this is the saying Permanent; Because the provider is leaving the duty or doing the intention of the pillar, even if it does with fear, except that it is with that as a disobedient, and it is affiliated with the goodness, and the righteousness, and the righteousness, and no And the prophet, peace be upon them, described that; Because he is upholstered and described it as forgetting in his saying: We forget and did not find him with determination [Taha: 115], and that contradicts the construction.The fourth saying: It is the choice of the most dismissed: that peace be upon him, I lead to the greatest in the cause The mistake is the mistake that it was said to him: This tree does not come close to this (P-14).He took a warmth and gone in his hand and said: “These are a solution to the females of my nation as a forbidden to their remembrance.“This is a light that God does not accept prayer except with him.” And he wanted his type, and when he heard Adam, peace be upon him, he said: “Do not come close to this, and this is the right of this.That inspired tree, so it left it and took it from another tree of that type, except that it was wrong in that dirt; Because the intention of God is the Almighty from the word of this, the type is not the person, and the guidance in the branches, if a mistake is not required to be punished and punished; To invoke his church universe as we are on our part, it was said: Speech is on this saying from his faces: One of it: that the word (this) is in the origin of the language of the significance to the present thing, and the present thing is only a specific thing, so this word is in the origin of the language of the language of the language of the language of the thing to the thing of the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the thing to the point The appointed is that the sign is intended for the type, so that is on the dispute of the original, and also because it is the highest, the sign is not permissible for it, so it is necessary for it to be a matter The person, then what was meant is out of the forbidden, not a referral, if this is proven, then we say: the mujahid is assigned to the sake of the sake of the sake of the right, so it is the right of peace He (this) was preserved on the same one, he had done the duty and did not have his pregnancy on the species, and he knew that this speech is a matter of two things: In terms of where they were, the authorization benefited in the entry of everything in paradise, except for what the evidence summarized.The second: that the mind requires the solution of the integrity with all the benefits except what the evidence is special, and the devoted evidence is not indicated except for that appointed, so the one who is the one who is the one who is the same They are permissible for him in the integrity of the birds of trees, and if this is proven, he is forbidden to be entitled to the reason This face is obligated to judge him that he was a misfortune, not wrong, and if it is also established, the corruption of this state.The second direction: in synthesis of this interpretation.He gave that (this) is a frequency between the person and the type, but is this Qur’an the Almighty with this memorization that indicates that what is meant is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one?If the first is, either it is said that the peace be upon him, insisted in the knowledge of that Bayan, then he will have come to the sins, and if he did not come in the knowledge He knew him, then he knew that the meant is the type, so his feet on the one from a tree of that type will be a resurrection on the sins.The third face: that the prophet, peace be upon them, will not be lost, because the guidance is based on the work of the work, and that is, but it is permissible in the right of the right Knowledge, as for the prophets, they are able to get the leanness, so it is not permissible for them to be lost; Because the confessing with the ability to be able to get the leanness is not permissible, mindful and legitimate, and if you prove that, it is proven that the feet are on the authority.The loud face: this question is either that it is from the sects or the suspicion, then if it was from the sects, the mistake was in it, and it is great, and it is great.And if it is from the suspicions, then we say: Every pioneer is a calamity, then the mistake does not fulfill in it in the first place, and if the misfortune is in it, one and the mistake in it is in it.How has this fate become of sin Because we are removed from Adam, peace be upon him, to his dress, and he was brought out of paradise and lined up to the earth?The answer to the first: (P-15) that this is noticeable, even if it was in the original, to point to the person, but it may be used to sign the dignity as it was presented, and it was presented, He coupled with what he indicated that what is meant is the type.The answer to the second: is that peace be upon him, perhaps he was short in the knowledge of that indicative; Because he thought that he was not obligated to that immediately, or it is said: He knew that indicative at the time of what God has forbidden to the tree, so when the period was not forgotten, then the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period, Because in the news that Adam, peace be upon him, remained in paradise, the long eternity, and then he was brought out.And the answer to the third: that there is no need for us to prove that the Prophet, peace be upon them, was grabbed by the guidance, for we have indicated that it is upon him peace be upon him.He has known it, but he has forgotten it, and it is what is meant by the words of the Almighty: He forgot and we did not find it with him with determination [Taha: 115] and the answer is about the lord: it is possible: However, peace be upon him, when he forgot her, the forgetfulness became an excuse that the sin would not become great or said: It was a belief, except that he arranged for him from the righteousness The journey of the Mujahidin.Because it is permissible to be different from the disagreement of the people, and that the Messenger has to pray and peace be upon him, which are devoted to many matters in the chapter of tightening and disturbance The nation, so here.And know that it is possible to say in the question another face, which is that it is up to what he said: This trees do not come close to this tree and their end with them, so he thought that he is the one who is peace be upon him.It is only that he is close to the tree and to be taken from it; Because his saying: Do not come close to them at the gathering, and it is not necessary from the end of the prohibition in the event of the expulsion.The face, so this is a sentence of what is said in this section, and God knows.* * * Wahwah: One of them: the saying of the stories, and he who narrated it from Wahb ibn Mnabah al -Yammani and al -Saddi on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them and others: Paradise enters the treasury of the treasury, and he came alive, and it is a bear with the fourth of the people, as if it was the baking, and it is the best of the animals, and then it is the same as the one who raised it.One of them accepted him, so the neighborhood was brought up and the garden entered it hidden from the treasury.Passes.So the life was not cursed and its strength was fell, and it became walking on its stomachs, and its livelihood was made in the dust, and it became an enemy of the sons of Adam, and I know that You must not pay attention to it; Because he is a loud, if he was able to enter the mouth of the neighborhood, then he did not appreciate it to make itself alive and then enters Paradise; Because when he did so in life, the neighborhood did not follow with the fact that it was not a rational or cost?And the second: that the Episis entered the paradise in the image of a dubbing, and this saying is less corrupted than the first.And the third of it: some of the people of the fundamentals said: Adam and the passion of them are peace, because they may be free to the door of paradise and Absis, he was close to the door and whispered.And the one who has been: is the saying of goodness: that Absis was in the earth and the connection of the hearts to them in Paradise.Some of them said: This is distant; Because the whispering is a hidden words, and the hidden words cannot be delivered from the earth to the sky, and they differed from another aspect, which is that the Episis is it, or it is said: The whispering to them is on the tongue of some of his followers (P-16), the pretext of the first saying: His Almighty saying: And their division is that I am for the one who advises: [21] The scouts, and also saying: they indicated them with vanity [Al -A'raf: 22].And the argument of the second saying: that Adam and the passion for them were peace, they knew him and knowing what he had from envy and enmity To him, then the pans should be for the boss, some of the following.There are two questions: the first question: that God Almighty has added this hook to Ebsis, so did they give them to that act?We said: The meaning of his saying: So I will be removed from them when he was whispering with that action, so I was added to a trick, as he said: [Noah: 6] So he said: He said that he was narrated from Ebsal: I had no sultans for you except that I called you, so you answered me [Ibrahim: 22], this is what the disgraced said.And verification in this addition is what we have decided, as the human being is able to do the action and the blessing, and with the equality, it is excluded to become a source of one of these people except for the two things The call to Him, and the call is a phrase in the right of the servant of knowledge, suspicion, or comprehension of the act of the verb, which is divided into a reconciliation, then if he gets the knowledge of the knowledge or the knowledge of it The verb was added to that for what was for the sake of which the actor has become a powerful force by the verb, for this meaning is added to the verb, and what he said is what he said: Adam, peace be upon him, came to the reason that it was the reason for the Ebeis, so the disobedience of Ebisis was obtained with a boss from us, and this is not a matter of what he did not.The verb, and that the curtains And if some of it arranged for some, then it is necessary to end it to what God Almighty creates in order Whoever is created and guided by whoever you can do [Al -A'raf: 155].The second question: How was that chaos?The answer: It is the one who told God Almighty in his saying: What we have given you on this tree, except that you are owners or you will be from the Creator: 20] From it, when it was not from that, he adjusted to the right to what he said: And their divorce is that I am for the advisors [Al -A'raf: 21], so he did not believe him as well, and the most promising is that he is so They occupied them with the extent of the permissible pleasures until they became exposed to it, so he obtained the reason for their expansion in it in it, the forbidden of the forbidden I know how to achieve things as how you were.As for the saying of the Exalted: We said, they are in his mind: It was in the land, and it was pleased with the transformation from a position to others, as it was said: Silent Egypt [Al -Baqarah: 61].The second question: They disagreed with those who address this speech after the agreement that Adam and the Hawas of them were peace and they were addressed to him and he mentioned it: The largest, that the Plice is inside it, also, they said: Because Ebis has been remembered in his saying: So the Satan is removed from it, so that they will be removed from them.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: Some of you are a bone enemy, so this is a definition of Adam and the passion for them, peace is that the enemy of them is their enemy, and they are not.Before the tree of the tree, he said: We said, O Adam, that this is an enemy for you and your husband, so do not leave you from paradise, and you will be brought up [Taha: 117] The prostration has become a disbeliever and was brought out of paradise and was said to him: (P-17) He was tied to it, so what is for you to arrogate in it [Al-A'raf: 13], and he also said: So come out of it, then come out of it I am tied to it for the sake of its arrogance, so the lax of Adam, peace be upon him, was after that in a long period of time Before that is before that, how is his saying: Get tired, and give it to him?We said: God is exalted when he tied him to the earth, so perhaps he returned to the sky once, for the sake of saving to whisper to Adam and Hawiya, and he said: He tied [Taha: 123], when they came out of paradise and gathered a Plice with them, he came out of Paradise, and he said: “Get up and from the people who said:“ No, ”he said: They have a single payment, but he said to each one of them on Sometimes at a time.The second face: that the meant is Adam, Hawa, and the neighborhood, and this is weak; Because it has been proven by consensus that the costs are the angels, the jinn, and the humanity, and it is a saying that this consensus is forbidden, for it is one of the people who says: He may be in the authority of the people.The costs of what the Almighty said: Everyone has taught his prayers and praised him [Al -Nur: 41], and Solomon said to the guidance: I would not be tormented by a severe torment [21].The third: The intended is Adam, Hawa, and their atoms; Because they were the origin of mankind, they were made as if they were all, and the evidence is upon him saying: Get up with some of the enemy, and it will be done for him My guidance, there is no fear for them, nor are they grieving, and those who disbelieved and lied to our verses of those who are the people of the fire in which they are immortal [Al -Baqarah: 39].This is a ruling that all people are prevented, and the meaning: some of you are the enemy of what people have to be used to and hated and misleading some of them.Know that this saying is weak; Because the offspring was not in that time, so how do they give the speech?As for those who claimed that the least of the group is two, the question is increased by his saying.The third question: they disagreed that it was said: they are tied or permitted, and the most like it is an order; Because it has a hard hardship; Because the separation of what they have from paradise to a position that the living does not happen in it except by the hardships and the hardship of the hardest cost, and if this is proven that this is the hero of what it thinks that it is the same Because the tension in the cost is a reason for the reward, how is it a punishment with the great benefit?If it is said: Are you not saying in the limits and many atonement: they are punished, even if they are from the door of the crocodile, say: As for the limits, it is a fate of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.To be a punishment if the man is Egypt, and the atonement is said in some of them: He runs the course of sanctities; Because it is only proven with the oath.As for being a wise man with her being brought to the great reward, no.The following question: that his saying is up to the Almighty: Get up with each other for an enemy, a matter of hypocrisy and there is no matter of hostility; Because the enmity of Elasis is for Adam and the Hawa on them, peace by them, because of the envy and the arrogance of the prostration, and his fostering is to them until it was brought out, For their atoms with the meeting of the boss and the supplication to the disbelief and disobedience, and something of that is not permissible to be a matter of it, so it is the righteousness of it.With it; To say to the Almighty: The Satan has an enemy, so they took it as an enemy.It appeared that what is meant by the verse is fastened from the sky, and you are some of the enemy.The fifth question: stable It will be in the sense of stability as the Almighty saying: to your Lord, the stable day [the Resurrection: 12], and it may be in the sense of the place where it is stable in it.The best is a good and stable (P-18) [Al-Furqan: 24], and he said: So, stable and righteous [Al-Anam: 98] If you know this, then say: The most of you are the most.Standardized [Al -Baqarah: 36] [Al -A'raf: 24], at the place, and the meaning is that it is stable in the states of life and death, and Al -Saddi narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, he said: You are in it.The first is the first; Because he is the Almighty, and that is only suitable for life; Because he is the Almighty, he addressed them with that with frustration, and that requires the state of life.And he knew that he said in the wall of Al -Araf in this story: He said: Separate some of you for some enemy And from that they come out [Al -A'raf: 25], so it is permissible for him to say: in which they live, to the last words of the words of his saying: And for you in the land, it is stable, and it is possible to Be an increase in the first.The sixth question: they disappeared in the sense of then after their agreement is that it is a name for adulthood, and the first is that the extended from time is intended; Because the man says to his friend: I have not seen you from a while if his view is after him They are very followed, they may say: and a time.The following question: Know that these verses are a great warning about all sins from face This is the young clown, it was a severe and tougie, the poet said: ؎ A looker who enrichs with my eyes, and a viewer of the matter other than the one who is the same And the wickedness of the paradise and the loudness of the game, I forgot that God has brought out Adama ∗∗∗ from the world with one guilt and from the conquest of the one who said: Plot to the world, so we have nothing but sorrow and sorrow until we return to the house that we are brought out of.And the second: warning about the arrogance, the envy, and the vein, on the authority of the saying of the Almighty: my father and the arrogance [Al -Baqarah: 34], the envy of the enemy of God said: The dignity said: I am fire, and this is my clay, then the keepers are thrown into the heart of Adam until he carried it on the composition of the one who is from him, then he will be thrown in the heart of Qabil.And the third of it: that it is the pursuit of it and the transgression of the hardship between the offspring of Adam and Abelis, and this is a great alert to the path of caution.
