The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: Say: Whoever is an enemy of Jabril, then he sent him down to your heart with the permission of God, sincerely, between his hands, and for his guidance, and for the sake of God.And his angels, messengers, Gabriel, and Mical, for God is an enemy of disbelievers.Institutions: The first question: that his saying is up to the Almighty: Say: Whoever is an enemy of Jabriel, who must have those who have caused and commanded it to appear from the time of the time of it until it is a matter The course of the pilgrim will run, so if it is not proven from them in that matter, it is not permissible for God to command him with that and the interpreters, they mentioned the things, and one of them is: The city was presented by the servant of God, the son of Suri, and he said: O Muhammad My eyes, and my heart does not sleep.And the slander and the poetry, so from the woman, you are true.The suspicion is for him, he said: I believed and said: Tell me, which food has forbidden the pads of himself, and in the mortar, the illiterate prophet tells him?By God, who has revealed the mosquitoes on Moses.Its soul loves food and drink, which is the camel of the camel and its milk?They said: Yes.He said to him: I remained one single if you said it, I believed in you, which king comes to what you say about God?Jabriel said: He said that our enemy is descending with fragmentation and intensity, and our Messenger is Michael comes with human beings and prosperity, and if he was the one who brings you, then he said: This hostility?Ibn Suri said: The principle of this hostility is that God Almighty has revealed to our Prophet that the house of the sanctuary will be destroyed in the time of a man who is said to him: So we asked him, and when we found it, we sent him to kill him with men, and Jabriel defended him and said: If God bless you, he will kill him, for this is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is that He will be destroyed by the house of the sanctuary, so there is no extensive in killing him, then he was old and strong, king, and invading, and he raised the house of the sanctuary and killed us, so he is so good.Michael (P-178), it is the enemy of Jabriel, and Omar said; I am testifying that whoever was an enemy of Jabril is an enemy of Mikayel and they are an enemy of those who are naked, so this is denied by that Omar, then God Almighty sent down these two verses.” And they said: O Omar, we have loved you, and we are in line with you, and he said: By God, I will not come to you for your love, and I do not ask you because I am a complaint in my debt, but I will enter you with a lot of people.His effects in your book, then he asked them about Jabriel, and they said: That is our enemy.They are from God?With two enemies, and you are atoning from the red, and whoever is an enemy for one of them was an enemy for the other Peace be upon him.A fighter: The Jews claimed that Jabriel, peace be upon him, was commanded.The reason for their enmity to him is that he was descending the Qur’an on Muhammad, peace be upon him, because he said: Whoever was an enemy of Jabril, then he is the same Feeling that this download does not not be a reason for the hostility, because he did that with the command of God, so it is not possible to be a reason for this Wahwah: The first: that the one who has been revealed by the Qur’an from the displaced of those with reward and the warning of the disobedience with the punishment and the matter of the warrior and the rituals, and the absence of it.Rather, with the command of God, who are aware that there is no discretion from his command and no way to his violator, then the hostility of this path is necessary for the hostility of God, and the hostility of God, The enmity of this path is disbelief.It is not appropriate for the angels who are informed, or he kissed him and brings him to the end of God’s command, so he will be directed at me The face is in the formation of Jabriel.Some people needed to remove the Qur’an, so it is necessary for those who are presenting those who are advanced to remove the supply on Moses, peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.That is false So she fell with this face, and the corruption of what they said.The second question: One of the people who follows to say people from the Jews: Gabriel their enemy said: Because we see the efforts in our time, this is the one who is so on our time.On the authority of one of their predecessors, he did not say that, and he knew that this is false because the story of God is true, and because their ignorance was hard and those who said: [Al -A'raf: 138].The third question: Ibn Katheer read: “Gabriel” with the opening of the gym and the breaking of the railway from others, and he read Hamza and Al -Kisa’i and Abu Bakr on the authority of Saam Approach and the rest of the gym and the Arabs are not important to the adulterers of a gun, and there are seven of the three languages ​​of them.Gabriel and Gabriel on the weight of Jabriel and Jabrin with the noun and the prevented of the scorpion of the definition and the legend.(P-179) The Following Population: Knowledge, he said: Abu Ali Al -Sousi: This is not valid for two Joahah: one of them: that he is not known from the names of God, “El”.The second: that if it was like that, the last name was passed.* * * As for his words, the Almighty: He descended it on your heart, so he has questions: The first question: The distraction in his saying is up to the Almighty: “So he” and in his saying: “ The answer is in it, saying: One of them is that the first distraction will come back to Gabriel, and the second is on the Qur’an, and if he does not have a remembrance of it, because it is like the knowledge Daba [Fatir: 45] means the ground, and this is the saying of Ibn Abbas and the most people of science.That is, if their hostility is because Gabriel is descending the Qur’an, then it is revealed by the permission of God.The owner of the “scout” said: It is not prevented by his remembrance in which he is raw for his friend, where he is made for the excess of his month, as if he is a matter His name is the remembrance of something of his attributes.And secondly: the meaning is that God has revealed Gabriel, peace be upon him, not that he has revealed himself.The second question: The Qur’an was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ What is the reason in his saying, he revealed it to your heart?Answer: This question is mentioned in the surah of the poets in his saying: The faithful spirit has come to him on your heart [Poets: 193] and the ummah is more than that of the Qur’an on the authority of it.His heart, except that he summarized the heart by mentioning that the one who descended in his heart was kept in his heart until he performed it to his nation, so when he was the one who was in his mother His heart is a memorizer, it is permissible to say: He descended it on your heart, even if it was in the truth, and he sent him to him, not on his heart.The third question: The right to speak was to be said to my heart, and the answer: It came to the story of the words of God As he spoke to him as if it was said: Say what I spoke to him from my saying, whoever was an enemy of Gabriel, then he sent him to your heart.The fourth question: How to straighten his saying: He descended it as a penalty for the condition?The answer is in it and Jahan: The first: that it is their pursuit and the exalted, indicating that this hostility is corrupted, because it is only that he was commanded to remove a book in which he is guided, so he is the guidance, then it is the guidance of the guidance Amor, it must be excused, and from where he came with guidance and evil, it must be skeptical, so how to fit the enmity.The second: He is the Almighty, showing that the Jews, if they are returning it, are right for them, because the book has come to you with a proof of your prophethood, and the truth of your sincerity, How do they hate those who have confirmed the matter that they are hate.As for his saying, “With the permission of God, it appears in the command of God, and he is the first of his interpretation of knowledge of his wings: the first: that the permission is the truth in the matter, and it is the truth in the matter.On his right to what I could.And the second: that its landing was one of the obligations, and the duty is beneficial from the matter, not from knowledge.And the third of it: That landing if it is a matter of necessity, it was more severe in the argument.As for his words, the Almighty: a believer in what is between his hands, and he is based on what I have to do with the most proud of it that what is meant is what he accepted from the books of the Prophet And among them is those who specialized in the convergence and claimed that he indicated that (P-180) the Qur’an agrees with the connotation in the indication of the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ.If it is said: Isn't that the Qur’an is a violation of the sect of the books of the books, and it did not become that it is a sincerity of it for its compulsion in the way And the prophecy of Muhammad is that it is not the truth of it?We said: The bouquet that the book of the books was destroyed by those who are in the past and ended in this time, based on the fact that the copy is the same.Then there is no between the Qur’an and between the books of the books.As for his words, the Almighty: It is guided, and it is intended for it that the Qur’an is denounced by two things: one of them: the two people who have been seized by the hearts of the hearts and the wings of the hearts.And secondly: that the one who comes with those of these works is how his reward is from this face with anchor, and when the first was presented to the second in the fences, there is no generosity to God.Al -Bashri, if it was said: And why did he specially give him a guidance and anchored with the believers with the fact that it is also the same?The answer is from Wajin: The first: It is up to them, but he specialized them with that, because they are those who guided the book, so it is like his saying: “Haddi”.The second: that it is only for the believers, and that is because the human is a expressive of the news The indication of the greatness of the great good, and this is only in the right of the believers, for this is God, may God be pleased with him.As for the second verse, which is the Almighty saying: Whoever is an enemy of God and his angels, know that he is up to what was clear in the first verse: Whoever is an enemy of Jabril for the sake At the heart of Muhammad, it must be an enemy of God Almighty, and he explained in this verse that whoever was an enemy of God was an enemy for him, so he indicated that in the absence The Hebrew of God, upon them and he is the hostility of God to them, because their enmity does not affect, does not benefit or harm, and his enmity is the Almighty leading to the righteous torment, not Questions: The first question: How can they be the best of God and the right to hostile to the enemy, and that is referred to God Almighty?The answer is that the meaning of the enmity on the truth is only valid for us because the enemy for others is the one who wants to remove those who are harmed by it, and that is referred to God, but God is exalted To return the guardians of God, and that is an enmity for God as His saying: Rather, the reward of those who fight God and His Messenger [Al -Ma’idah: 33] And his Messenger [Al -Ahzab: 57] because what is meant by the two sons of God without him for the sacrifice of the forbidden and the harm to Him, or if he wants to do so and his will is his verse And after them, they are on the authority of that It is correct that the harm is permissible for them, but their enmity does not affect them for their miracles of the affected matters in them, and the enmity of them is in them Because it is in the urgent, it requires humiliation and dwelling, and in the laterness, the permanent torment requires.The second question: When he mentioned the angels, he did not recall Jabriel and Mikael with their dumps in the angels?The answer is for two Jighane: The first: they turned them up with the remembrance of their preference, as if they were for their virtues, and they have become another gender except the angels.The second: that the one who took place between the Messenger and the Jews is their remembrance and the verse, but it came down by them, so it is not a text on their names, and I know that this is the same All of the angels, otherwise this interpretation is not correct, and if this is proven, then he says: It is necessary for Jabril to be upon him, peace be upon him.The peace be upon him is mentioned in the remembrance, and the preference for the virtuous in the remembrance is uncertain, so it is obligatory to be a gravitational arrogant (P-181) (P-181) (P-181) Peace be upon him: “What the Muslims saw is good, and it is good for God.” And the second: that Gabriel, peace be upon him, descends with the Qur’an, the revelation, and the knowledge, which is The substance of the meeting of the souls, and the Mikayel is descending with gravity and rain, which is the subject of the eternity of the eternity, and when the science was honored by the nutrition, it must be Jabril.And the third of it: His exalted say in the description of Jabriel: a obedience, then a faithful [Al -Takwir: 21] He must be better than him.The second question: Abu Amr and Hafsa read the capital of Mical in Bouzen Qunatat, and a dispersed Michael, not after the gossip, Michael on the weight of Mikael, in which there is another language, Michael on the weight of Michael, and Mikael Kaikil, the son of my gin said: The Arab In it.The third question: Al -Waw in Jabril and Mical, it was said: Waw Al -Atef, and it was said: in a sense or means who was an enemy of one of these, then God is the same.The following question: an enemy for the disbelievers who wanted an enemy to them, but he came with the most promising to indicate that God Almighty is to them for their disbelief and that the angels.
