The Quranic researcher, and his saying is the Almighty: And they are commanded, except to worship God, and those who have the religion are hypocritical and evaluate the prayer and pay zakat, and that is the debt of the debt: (P-42) The first question: in his saying: What they are commanded and Jahan: one of them: that the meter is: and what they are commanded in the supply and the Gospels, except with the Hanafi religion, so they were the one who was Those who are afflicted with that, except that he is exalted when he followed him with his saying: That is the religion of values, our knowledge is that this is judgment as it was in the right of our right.And secondly: that the intended is: What the people of the book are commanded on the tongue of Muhammad ﷺ except with these things, and this is first, for three faces: one of them: that the verse is on this A new jurisprudence and carry the words of God on what is more important.And the second: It is that the remembrance of Muhammad, peace be upon him, has passed it to us, and he said: The structure came to them until the sons of the Prophet came to them, and the peace be upon them.And the third of it: He is the Almighty, the verse was seen by saying: This is the debt of validity, so he judged the fact that what is related We said: that it is a junction of our before us or a new law that is this bias for the law of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and this is the saying of a fighter.The second question: In his saying: Unless they worship God as a minute, which is that this mother is the mother of the supply, so it is not possible to carry it on the other For a sake, it is a deficient for his self, which is completed with that abuse, so if God did, he would have been incomplete for his self -associated with otherwise, and he is referred, because he is a referral, because he is a referral, because he is the one who is.From his footsteps, the old action, and if it is an update, he agreed to another exhibition, so let the sesulus be obligatory, and it is referred, and because if it is rewarded for the sake of that Poously, and if he was able to do that, the ritual of that medium is in vain, so you have proven that it could not be carried on his appearance, so there must be from it.Then Al -Farah said: The Arabs make the pain in the position of “in the matter and will of the will many, from that the Almighty saying: God wants to show you to you [26] [Al -Safa: 8] And he said in the matter: And he commanded us to Islam [Al -Anam: 71] and she is in the readers of Abdullah: The debt of religion.The devotion is alarm about the pure intention, and the pure intention is when it was an adequate, the intention was considered, so the verse was indicated that every matter of it is not, and there is no matter Come on, then Al -Shafi’i said: The ablution is commanded by it in his saying: “If you rise to the prayer, wash, and your faces [Al -Ma’idah: 6] It is obligatory to be intense, It is obligatory from the group of the two verses, and the place of the ablution is intense, and the disgraceful, they are obligated to revert to the actions of God and the rulings of the righteous On its appearance, they said the meaning of the verse: They are not commanded with anything except for the sake of worshiping God, and the reference to this saying is also strong, because the one is a power To worship God, who have been saved by the religion in that thing, and this also requires the intention of the intention in all the commandments.If it was said: The view in the knowledge of God is commanded by Him, and it is evident that the intention of the intention is in it; Because the intention can only be adopted after the knowledge, as it was before the knowledgeable, the intention can not be adopted in it.We said: He gave it that he specialized the general verse in this image with the judgment of the mental, mental, who you mentioned, and it will remain in the rest of the argument.* * * The third question: His saying: They commanded a reminder of what was not named by his actor, which is: He wrote to you fasting [the cow: 183] They said: There are faces in it: one of them: as if it is the Almighty saying: worship is difficult and I do not want your hardships an original will, but my will to your worship is like the will of the mother, And for this, when the matter is to the mercy, he said: Your Lord wrote on the same mercy [Al -Anam: 54], and he wrote in their hearts faith [the argument: 22] and it is mentioned in the father.He says to him first: He is not able to do this and not command him (P-43).To hide the crocodile.And the second: I say goodbye to the good and the mind, we say: As if he is the Almighty saying: I am not commanding the worship only, but the mind of your mind The end in the glorification of those who prayed to you [that] the end of the public is a duty in the minds.The following question: The blame is in his saying: And they are commanded except to worship God, indicating that the people of the Sunnah are gone Paradise, or to the distance from the punishment of fire, but for the sake of that you are a servant and he is a Lord, so if he did not get the reward or punishment for the religion, then your command.It was obligatory for the servitude of the servants, and in it also indicated that it is the one who worshiped God for reward and punishment, for the worshipers in the truth is the reward and the punishment, the truth, and the righteousness, Arifan for the Arabs has said in the second and whoever influenced the Africans, not to the Arafan, but the well -being, then he has fought the journey of the prayer.The fifth question: worship is humiliation, and there is a slave method, that is, humiliated, and whoever claims that the obedience is a mistake, because a group worshiped the angels They obeyed them, but on the legs it became a name for every obedience to God, I was given to him on the face Sleeping and ending in glorification, and know that worship in this sense does not deserve it except for those who are one in himself and his sublime and actual attributes, for if it is not, for if it is for the same The end in the majestic is spent, then we say: It is necessary to be in the act of worship from two things: one of them: the absence of the glorification, and for this to God: With worship, because he does not know the greatness of God, so he will not be his action in the end of the greater.The second: to be a matter of it, then the act of the Judaism is not worship, and if you include the end of the majestic, because it is not a matter The boy’s action is not a worship to lose extension and the act of the Judaism is not a worship of the lack of matter, so how do you kneel?* * * The sixth question: The salvation is that it comes to the verb pure for one preacher, and it is not for others from the reasons that are effective in the supplication to that the verb, and from the verb, and the verb of the verb.Wajoh: One of it: as if he is the highness of my servant, do not accommodate the abundance of obedience, but rather in its salvation, because I did not exhaust every place for you until I ask all of you I made you a half, so I asked some of the twelve, and a sheep of the four, but the destiny that I did, I did not want to do so Sail, so do not exceed your obedience to yourself, as you are excluded from others, so that it is permissible, which is found from you in the prayer, such as the ritual, and it is the ritual You excluded it for your soul, so the salvation was fulfilled.And the second: As if he was upset, he said: O mind, you are a wise, and it is not inclined to ignorance and foolish Glory be to him, the king of the two worlds, and the mind is a king of this body, as if he is the Almighty, he said: The king does not serve the king, but [for you] For your sake: He is the one who created for you what is in all the earth [the cow: 29], so make you all what you do for me: and what they are commanded, except for the servants of God Religion.And he knows that his saying: Separate we are in the case, so he alerted him to what is obligatory to obtain salvation from the start of the verb to his end, and the creature is the one who comes To his goodness, and the duty of his duty, so he comes to the verb to his face (P-44) is a savings for his Lord, he does not want to see, nor he reports, nor another, but he said: Rather, they said: Paradise is intended, nor the survival of the fire, and if it is inevitable, and in Al -Tawarah: what I want to do with it, and his heart is a lot, and I want it to be a lot.A little.And they said from salvation that there is no more worship in worship Others, like: the duty of the sacrifice is a sheep.He saw him, it is not permissible, for this if you mix with worship, other worship, so how if you mix with it, like it, like you, you will not be able Zakat to the two parents and the two loyalists, nor to the slave or the slave because it was not rid How to keep salvation?The weapon of the line has disagreed in the sense of its saying: two people: some of them said: those who are associated with him with worship, and others said: They are in the heart of the heart of God, and he said: Al -Zajaj: That is, they worship him, and they will not worship him with him otherwise, and this is indicated by his saying: And they are commanded except to worship God: 31].As for the saying of the Exalted: Hanafi, and they will pray the prayer, and they will pay zakat, so he said: The first: Mujahid said: They followed the religion of Abraham, and he said: Follow the mourning of Abraham Hanif and what was among the partners [Al -Nahl: 123] This interpretation is in a kindness, as if he was the one who knew that the mourning is the one Its prevention is removed from imitation of the kidneys, and it is not completed by the imitation of the kidney, as well They were zakat, and he is a wasting and those with him, so he said: You have been a good level in Abraham, and those with him [the conquered: 4], so that he said: Your religion, for you are an imitator of Abraham, where you disavow the idols, and this is not strange.And he has his goodness to the nearby, but he narrated that he heard: the sakes of destiny, so he was rejected, and he did not see a person, so he returned, so he said: Jabriel appeared to him, peace be upon him, and he said: You have the right to you, as your poison is a successor, so take your money, because the one who said I was, but I cut off to God, until he said: So, no, the right to be glorified as if he says: If you are worshiped, then worship his servants, so if the halal and the doors of the sultans are not left, and the sultans do not leave, If you are not able to follow up on Ibrahim, then strive to follow up on his boy, how to save the rule of his Lord with his younger, and the one who is a long time Without a man, he followed the micooms with the sacrifice of the mind, and he is the mother of the sacrifice.The one is the standing of the one man in testimony and inheritance, and the dance is half The freedom is with the way that the freedom has two nights of the division, so it was migrated.When the Khalil left it and only a single in the mountains of Mecca without water or increased, and he was shrouded, and he does not speak to it and does not kindly overlook it, she said: God bless you?So he fell asleep with his head, and she was satisfied with that and be patient with that hardship.And the second saying: What is meant by his saying: the righteousness of any of the straight and the ritual is the ruling, but the exhortation of the feet was called the rituals of the way of optimism, as is the same, as well The destruction has a reward, and its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: Those who said our Lord God, then they were straightforward.The third: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said.That is because he mentioned the worshipers first and then said: Hanafi, but the pilgrim came to prayer, because in the pilgrimage a prayer and the agreement of money.Al -Rabaa: Abu Qalbah said: The Hanif who believed in all the messengers and did not exceed one of them, so whoever does not believe in the best of the prophet is how it will be.Fifth: Hanafi, that is, universes for all religion, as the Hanafi is all the religion, peace be upon him: The marriage of the inquisce, that is, the deceitful who are forbidden for the marriage of the mother and the incest, and his saying: Hanafi is a sign of the negation, then he will be buried, and he said: The sword: The father of a Muslim said: Its origin is from the hanfar in the man, and it is the dumbbells of its dignity from its tanning until it is accepted on the last of the other, so the Hanif is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be Islam.The eighth: Al -Rabi’a bin Anis said: The Hanif who accepts the kiss with his prayers, but he said that because he is when he said: And the land is a heavy, and the words in the establishment of prayer and the payment of zakat have passed a lot, and then he said: And that is the religion of resurrection and in which there are questions: the first question: the first one said: That is the debt of the valuable mortar, for the values ​​are based on a deleted Sufism, and what is meant by the validity is either the straight or the standing, and we mentioned these two words: A valuable books, and Al -Farah said: This is from the addition of the adjective to al -Muneot, as it said: This is the right of the jungle [the incident: 95] and the distraction of the vagina as it is in the saying.* * * The second question: In this verse, it is for all: one: that the bladder is in everything, but it will be obtained if the origin is obtained and the branch with it, so the people of the rulings of the rulings are in the They are the Jews, Christians, and the Magi, so they may have tired themselves in obedience, but they did not get the right religion, and people have obtained the origins and the most important ones The voices, and they are the righteous who said: The sin does not harm with faith, and God Almighty has sinned the two parties in this verse, and he said that there is no need in the knowledge of the knowledge Separate and from doing in his saying: They evaluate the prayer and pay zakat, then he said: And that group is all of it is the debt of the valley, that is, the evidence is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.The group of members is one religion, as is the group of one religion, so the heart of your religion is the opponent and the face of the prayer and the description of the right to the right of the Zakat; Because with the tongue, the destiny of your grace appears, and with the charity, the destiny of your religion appears, then the value of those who do the right of those who are excluded from the resurrection of the righteousness Glory be to him says: The existing by obtaining your reconciliation is urgent and later is this group, and his counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: a debt of values ​​and his saying in the Qur’an: Strongly because the Qur’an is the validity of the guidance to the truth, and his saying is supported by peace be upon him: “Whoever is in the work of God was God in his work and God bless him.” Dunya, whoever served you, take it, and those who serve me, and serve him, “and the second: that the good people in their actions are the same as the truth, and it is for you, and that is to you.That is that they occupied the praise of their creativity, for charity from God, not from the angels, and the glorification and the servitude of the angels, not from God, then God, then God, then God, then God And God says, showing them: My angels are your best, praise and be all over, but rather in some of the actions of my best, do well and believe, then I will be blessed with you You came to him from the servants, and you glorify me with the inventory of what I did from charity, so you have been patient with one of the two things: establish the prayer, come to the servants of God With charity, you have been patient with one of the two things while they were patient with the two things, so the angels are surprised by them, and they are installed to them.They have from each chapter, peace be upon you, with what you have been patient [Al-Raad: 32-42] Will this religion be valuable?And the third of it: that religion is like the same as the life of religion with the definition, then the world is a world without destiny, such as the inconvenient time, and the one who does not know the knowledge of the time, then the knowledge of the time, then the knowledge, then The soul was complete, so the prayer of the religion is like knowledge, and zakat is like destiny.And its elevation: It is the one who is a deepening that the wise is up to his Messenger, to invite them to the easiest thing, which is the saying and the belief, and he said: He is the one who answered it, then he answered, then he asked him, then he asked him, then he asked him, then he asked him, then he asked him, then he asked him, then he asked him, then he asked him.Which after its performance remains the same as it is as it was, then when they answered and wanted from them the charity and he knew that it was made to them, he said: “No, Zakat In money until the referral is upon him, “Then when everyone mentioned, he said: And that is the religion of values.With this verse, he said: The group of words, deeds and deeds is religion, and religion is Islam and Islam is faith, so when the group of words and deeds and deeds are the faith, it is the faith, because it is the faith.The verse is the three.Imran: 19] Rather, we said: Islam is the faith of Jajin: The first: that faith, even if it was not the same as Islam, would not be acceptable to God, the Almighty, whoever says: [Al -Imran: 85] will not be accepted from it, but faith in gatherings is acceptable to God, so it is the eye of Islam.In it, there is no house from the Muslims [Al -Dhariyat: 35], so the Muslim is from the believer, indicates that Islam is true to him, and if this is proven that this is the one These three mean the saying, the verb and the work is faith, and then the saying of the one who said: Faith is a name for the stagnant of the knowledgeable, or for the sacrifice.Why is it not permissible for the reference to be by saying: only to the salvation?So they say: What is meant: that is the masculine, and there is no doubt that the numbers of the guests are the first, we gave us that he said: This is a sign of the group that is not presented to him that is the one who is the same It is the valuable religion, so you said: That is the whole of the religion, and that is because the religion is not.The religion was having, and its effects and consequences were with it, and it is also, and it is prayer and zakat, and if this group is not found, the debt is not the values ​​of the religion Religion is not a habit and the conflict is what happened in it?
