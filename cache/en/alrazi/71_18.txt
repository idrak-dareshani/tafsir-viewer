The third Quranic researcher: The neutrality of the Almighty saying: And God has spoken to you from the earth as a plant and then restores you in it and removes you.He knew that he returned here to the souls of the soul, and it is like an interpretation of his saying: He created you as phases.It comes out from it again, but his saying: I woke you from the ground as a plant, so it has two questions: the first question: in this verse and the servants: one of them: one of them: one of them: From the earth, that is, your father woke up from the earth as he said: The example of Jesus with God is like Adam, who created him from the dust [Al -Amran: 59].The second: that it has expressed all of the earth; Because he is the Almighty, it creates us from the nomads, and it is generated from the nutrients generated from the plant generated from the earth.The second question: It was not possible to say: I have spoken to you, except that he did not say that, but he said: You have gave you a plant, and the appreciation is your welfare, so you will not be a nap Likely, which is that if he said: You have spoken to you, the meaning was a great germination, and when he said: You have given you a plant, the meaning was your alert.Because the germination is a description of God Almighty, and the description of God is not a sense of us, so we do not know that this germination is fully fully strange, except with the mediation of the news of God On the fullness of God Almighty, it is not possible to prove it with hearing, but when he said: “You have spoken to you as a plant” in the sense of your affiliation, so you would not have a fully domesticated, and it was a fully domesticated It is a complete, fully strange, and the plant is like that, as well as a witnessed view, so that he can be subjected to it on the fullness of God Almighty, for this is the exalted.It appeared that the enemy is from that truth to this metaphor, for this pleasant secret, but his saying: Then he will restore you in it, then it is a sign to the way that is the one who is in the Qur’an that was in the Qur’an that was in the Qur’an that was Perfume on the appetite that was able to return, and say it: It brings you out a breakthrough that he confirmed with the source as if he said: He really brings you out, not referred.
