The researcher is the Almighty: It was written on you if one of you is attended by death if you leave the best of the commandment for the debtors and those close to those who are known to the one who is true.Know that his saying is up to the Almighty: He was written on you that the obligatory must be based on what he has shown, but his saying: If one of you attends the death, then it is not what is meant from him.Because in that time, it will be unable to rise, and then they mentioned his interpretation (P-51) and two parties: The first: It is the choice of the most, that the intention is the presence And that is a phenomenon in the language, it is said that the death is afraid of him: He has attended the death as it is said to whom the country is said: He has arrived.The second: the saying of the deaf: that what is meant is that the commandment is imposed on you in the case of health that you say: If the death is attended, then do so.The judge said: The first saying is the first to Jahin: One of them: that the recommended, even if he did not remember in his dead and dead, is permissible.The second: that what we mentioned is the back, and if it is possible, it is not permissible to carry the words other than it.As for his saying: If you leave it better, then there is no disagreement that the money is here, and the best is that money is intended in many of the Qur’an as his saying: and what you spend is the best of the good: [272] From the best of a poor [Al -Qasas: 24] If you know this, then say: We say: One of them: that there is no difference between the few and the many, and it is the saying of Al -Zuhir Boujahin: The first: that God is the Almighty and obligated the commandment if it is left good, and the few money is better, and the Qur’an and the one who is said is indicated by the Qur’an and the one who is the one who is the Qur’an He does the weight of an atom is good that he sees and who does the weight of an atom of evil that he sees [the earthquake: 7, 8] It is that the best is what is beneficial to it, and the few money is like that, so it will be better.The second pilgrimage: that God is the Height of the rulings of inheritances, while the money remains a few, a lot, with the evidence of His Excellency: The men have a share of what is the one who is blessed A share of what the parents and the closests left from what he said, or a lot of an exhibiting share [Women: 7], so the matter must be like that in the commandment.And the second saying: It is that the goodness of the good in this verse is concluded with the many money, and they needed it with its face So that it is money, but it is wanted to glorify its money and its equivalence, the limit of the people of the need, and if the name of the money may fall into the truth about all that is funded by the human being If it was said: So and so in a grace, and in a flagrant from live.Rather, it is intended to multiply the grace, even if it is no one that does not break from the grace of God, and this is a section of metaphor, which is a denial The name is about the thing to shorten it, as it was narrated from his saying: “There is no prayer for the slaughter of the mosque except in the mosque” and his saying: Come on, "and like this.The third pilgrimage: If the commandment was obligatory in all that was left, whether it was a little, or a lot, the piety would not have said: If you leave it, it is a good thing.Because every one must be left, a little or a lot, but who dies naked and does not remain with it as a fracture His righteousness, then that in the end of the scarf, if it is proven that what is meant is from good money, then that money is it estimated with a certainty, and no one?In it is the saying: The first saying: It is estimated with a certain amount, and then those who say this saying, they have disagreed, and narrated from the pleasure of God, may God be pleased with him.To them in the death, and he has the seventh of their dirhams, so he said first to me?He said: No, but God Almighty said: If you leave a good and you have a lot of money, and on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that a man said: I want to command, he said: He said three thousand, she said: How much do you have?Four said: God said: If you leave good, and this is something that is easy to leave for your life, then it is better.The etiquette of a monotonous dirham.And on the authority of Qatada: a thousand dirhams, and on the authority of Al -Nakh’i: from a thousand and five dirhams.(P-52) The second saying: It is not estimated with a specific estimated prohibition.Rather, this is different from that of the men of men; Because with an estimated money, the woman describes a rich, and that destiny is not described by others as rich for the sake of the many children and the abundance Considering a capacity estimated at the same as the guidance, it is not anyone to make the bayet in the amount He says: If it was obligatory, it is obligatory to estimate the required money in it.* * * As for his saying: the commandment is in his two questions: the first question: he said: He was written because he wanted with the commandment of the righteousness, and for that, he mentioned the one who said: After he heard it [Al -Baqarah: 181] and also it was mentioned to the separation between the verb and the command; Because the words when the factor was between the feminine and the verb, such as the rosaries of the ritual p Because the judge is among the verb and between the woman.* * * The second question: raising the commandment from two sides: one of them: on what he did not name his actor.The second: It should be a beginner and for the religion of the news, and the sentence will be in the position of raising a writer, as you say: It was said: the servant of God is the one who says: A compound sentence of beginner and news, And the sentence is in a position of lifting.* * * As for his saying: For the debts and the closest, he has the books: the first question: Know that God is exalted, when he showed that the commandment is a duty, and it is clear that it is that And he said: (For the two children and the closest), and in it and Jahan: The first: The deaf said: They were commanding the people to seek a request for pride and honor, and they are left in the rituals, So God is exalted in the first commanding Islam, for the people of prevention of the people who were used to what they used to do, and this is clear.The second: Another said: The positive of this will, when it was before the verse of inheritance, made God the choice to the one who is commanded in his money and his obligation is that he does not exceed his money.The parents and the closests will be and pray to them with his fullness and his choices, and for that when the verse of the inheritors came down, he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: His right is not a trustee for a heir.The giving of the guardian, and if it is like that, there is no trustee for the heir of the bit, then on this direction, the commandment was before and a duty for the two parents and the closest.* * * And they said: They are the children, so this is the command of God Almighty with the commandment of the two parents and the children, and he is the saying of Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd on the authority of his father.The second saying: It is the saying of Ibn Abbas and Mujahid that what is meant is one of the two parents.The third saying: They are all relatives; Whoever inherits from them and who does not inherit, and this is the meaning of the saying of those who have the will of the will to the relative, then he saw it as a texture.And the righteous saying: They are the ones who do not inherit from the man from his relatives, but the inheritors are outside the memorial, but his saying: the well -being is that he is the one who does not It is recommended to him, and it is expected that what is meant by him is distinguished by those who recommend him from those who are not recommended; Because both of the two are entered into the known, as if he had commanded him in the commandment to ask you (P-53), the beautiful way, then if he passes between them, then he will be among them Some of the parts are forbidden; Because if he had forbidden the jurist and the essential of the sinner, it was not known, and if the two parents were between the greatness For the children of grandfather, with the presence of the brotherhood, what was not known is not known, for God Almighty has the will of the commandment on a beautiful way to be free from the virginity He is known as usual, so no one would say: If the commandment was a duty and a duty, the exalted in this condition, which is not possible for what is not possible.* * * As for His Excellency said: Really on the righteous, a increase in the affirmation of his duty, and his saying: (really) is a certain source, that is, the right of that The words require this toxicity to the righteous without others.The deputies are from two voices: the first: that what is meant by his saying: really on the righteous that it is necessary for those who have influenced the piety, and it is forbidden and made it a way for it and it is a way of it.The second: That this verse requires the path of this meaning on the righteous, and the consensus indicates that the duties and the clogged are general in the right of the righteous, and others, and others Everyone is under this cost; This is the total of what is related to the interpretation of this verse.And know that the people disagreed in this commandment, some of them said: It was a duty, and among them who said: I was a scar, and the first was booked with his saying: The two people are predicted from the garment, then it is the highest that affirmed the affirmation by saying it: really to the righteous and these they disappeared; Some of them said: This verse has become woven, and among them is those who said: It is what has become a textured, and this is the choice of my father, Muslim Al -Asifhani, and the report of his saying: What is contrary to the verse of inheritances and its meaning: He wrote to you what God Almighty has forgotten from the inheritance of the parents and the closest of those who say: God bless you: It is necessary to recommend the debts and closeness to save what God has dedicated to them, and that they do not decrease from their stories.And the second: that there is no contradiction between the evidence of the inheritance of the relative with the confirmation of the commandment by the inheritance, given from God Almighty, and the commandment is the one who is from the one He gathered him between the commandment and the inheritance with the ruling of the two verses.And the third of it: If we were able to obtain the contradiction, it could be made the verse of the inheritance specially for this verse and that; Because this verse requires the commandment for the closest, then the verse of the inheritance comes out of the heir, and the relative who is not the inheritance is within this Among the two parents who inherit, and among them who do not inherit, and that is due to the disagreement of religion, tenderness and killing, and from the relatives who do not fall in the path of those who do not Whoever falls in a state and proves in a state, if he is in the location of those who are in the inheritance of them, and among them is those who fall in every case if they are the soul He has, and whoever is not a heir to him, for him for the sake of the compassion of mercy, then God has confirmed the Almighty with his saying: and fear God, who is the one who has been.And by saying: God commands justice, charity, and giving to the kinship [Al -Nahl: 90], so this is a report of the path of my father Muslim in this section.* * * As for those who say that the verse is a texture, it is directed to a separation of this gold research: the first search: they differed in what is the evidence that has become a manner?And they mentioned his faces: one of them: that it became a textured by giving God to the people of the inheritances of all who have the right to his right.This is far; Because it is not obeyed with the amount of the right to the inheritance and the level of other destiny with the commandment, and the most required of that specialization is that it is not the one who says that there is no one who says: P-woven (P-54), who is not left except for the two parents from where all the money becomes a right to them by the reason for inheritance, so there is nothing but that.And the second: that it became a textured with his saying, peace be upon him: On this question, that this news, and if it is one of the news, the imams received it with acceptance, then it is entitled to the frequent.And to say that he says: It is claimed that the imams are delivered to the acceptance on the face of the suspicion or on the face of the cut It is permissible to copy the Qur’an with it, and the second is a variety; Because if they had seized his health with the chapter on the chapter on the chapter, they would have gathered on the mistake and that it was not permissible.And the third of it is that it has become woven with consensus, and the consensus is not permissible for the Qur’an to be copied; Because the consensus indicates that the indicators were excessive, but they were satisfied with the consensus from the remembrance of that indicative.And it is a saying to say: When it was proven that in the nation, who denies the fall of this copy, how is it claimed that the consensus is called on the copy of the copy?And its booster: that it became a bond with a measure, which is to say: This will if it was a duty, then when this is not there, this is not the right.These are close to the debts that the will is not found, but when the commandment is not found for these relatives, they are not fulfilled, they are not fulfilled, in which they are not fulfilled.The verse of inheritances: After a guardian, it is recommended or a debt [Women: 11] and the appearance of the verse requires that if it is not a guardian or debt, the money is the same.And it is a saying to say: The Qur’an is copied with the measure, which is not permissible, and God knows.* * * The second search: those who say that this verse has become a texture, they disagreed with two sayings; Some of them said: It has become a fool in the right of those who inherit and in the right of those who do not inherit and he is the saying of the most interpreters and those who are considered jurisprudence, and those who have said: A fixed one who does not inherit, and it is the gold of the son of Abbas, the Basr al -Basri, the hurt, the conqueror, the sacrifice, and the Muslim of the son of Yasar and the elderly bin Ziyad until he said: To recommend his closeness, he has seen his work with a disobedience, and Tlasss said: If I recommend to the party and the relatives left, we are removed from them and returned to the relatives, so the one who is the one is that It remains a sign of the will of the commandment for the closeness that is not inherited, and the argument of these are from two sides: the first argument: that this verse is indicative For the relative, the work of it is left in the right of the heir to the relative, either by the verse of the other, or by saying it to him, peace and blessings be upon him: For the inheritors, and we are unanimously, there is no existence with the appearance of the dispute in it as an ancient and a hadith, so the verse must remain indicative of the path of the commandment for the one who is not.The second pilgrimage: His saying is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him: The commandment for other relatives is not otherwise, so this must be the obligatory will be specialized in the approaches, and the Sunnah has become a certainty in the Qur’an This will.As for the generosity who say that this verse has become woven in the right of the relative who is not inherited, so I am on the authority of what they have to do with the saying of it: A debt, and we mentioned it before.* * * The third search: those who say that this verse is what has become woven in the right of the relative who is not inherited, (P-55) they were in the way of the two sides: Masoud that he made this commandment for the poor, so the poor is one of the relatives, and the Basr Al -Basri said: They and the songs are both.The second: It was narrated from Al -Hasan, Khalid Bin Zaid and Abd al -Malik ibn Ali, that they said in the one who recommends that it is not his closeness and has a kinship that you do not inherit: The kinship and the third of the third for those who are descended to him.And on the authority of Tawnis: that the relatives, if they were needed, the commandment was removed from the heapcra and returned to the relatives, and God knows.
