The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent, is high: they have the clothes of a green, and a cure in which there are questions: the first question: a sophisticated reader and a garment of “their loudness” with the place of the yaa, The first reader, and the face is in it to be “high”, and “the clothes of Sandis” have told him, and the meaning: What they raise from their dress is the clothes of Sannis, so it is high.A single, and “the clothes of Sennas” are a group, and the beginning if it is a unique person whose news is not collected.In the sense, its counterpart is the saying of the Almighty: those who arrogate it with Samar, who migrated [the believers: 67], so the dubbric of the people was cut as if it was the same.As for the second reader, which opens the ya, they mentioned in this monument three times: the first: that it was poured into the disobedience; Because when he was “high” in the sense of the one who is running in this Arabization, as he said: The knee is below you [Al -Anfal: 42] as well, which is the saying of my father.The second: that it was in the case, then this also, it is destroyed by its faces: one of them: Abu Ali al -Farisi said: Al -Taqqar: and they met them with a freshness and pleasure in the event of what is high.And the second: Al -Tamadir: It is rewarded with what they have been patient with heaven and free, if they are loud, the clothes of Sennas.And the third of it: that the estimation is: it is floated on the righteous, if the righteous are high.And the one who is upset: I calculated them for a scattered pessimism if they are high, and on the first three, the three clothes will be the clothes of the righteous, and the righteous clothes, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous, and the ritual, The clothes are the clothes of the baby.The third face is in the reason for this text: that the estimation is: you saw the people of Naim and a loud king of Sandis.The second question: a brilliant and bridge reader: “Green and Tabarqqa” both of them with lift, and the Kasayi and the bars of both of them were read by the sane, and the son of the son of Kidar: With lightness, and “beggar” by raising, and Abu Omar and Abdullah bin Amir read: “Khidr” by raising, (P-224) and “Skarq” with the sake of the words, It is permissible in it, the failure and the lifting, but the raising is, if you make it a row for clothes, and that is an apparent; Because it is a comprehensive adjective for a group, and as for the reduction, if you make it a row of Sanad; Because “Sennas” I want the sex with it, so it was in the sense of gathering, and he authorized the fear and described the word that the gender is intended for, as it is said: And their white dar, except that he said: It is a chaos, and the evidence is on its ugliness that the Arabs come with the gathering that is in the memorization of the one, and they will run it.Abdal, and in the download from the green tree [Yass: 80] and the miracle of the softening of a thickness [Moon: 20] when they had turned out the attributes of this confusion from the group, so the one who is in the one who is in the whole The meaning of the collection is that his class is separated.As for “diving”, it is permissible for raising and lowering, as well Reducing, if I want to add the clothes to it; As if it was said: “The clothes of Sannis and Tabarqqa” and the meaning are their clothes, so the clothes added to the two bases, as it is said: the clothes of a pricker and a veneer, and it is indicated by the saying Feeling clothes from a chain of transmission and coffin, and know that the facts of this verse have been presented in the surah of the cave.The third question: the smile is what was raised from the Dibaj, and the arrogance is what he has risen from, and all of that is within the name of the warrior, the Almighty said: And they have a warmth in it, and then it is a warm.For their dress, they are the children who are immoral, and it was said: This is the dress of the righteous, and as if they wore several clothes, so the one who highs it is more than it, and this is the one who said: Tamam his saying: those who are lean on your opinions, and their meaning is loud, meaning: above their rituals, the wasting of them is the clothes of Sanad, and the meaning is that the rituals of their rituals.* * His Excellency said: And they resolved from a silver, and there are questions: The first question: The Almighty said in the surah of the cave: Those are the gardens of them, and they will run from them I wake up from gold [the cave: 31], so how to make those captives here from a silver?(And the answer) from three faces: one of them: that there is no contradiction between the two things, so perhaps they are enlightened by the two genius; Either on the punishment or at gathering, as the women do in the world.And the second: that the nature is different, the Lord of a person whose prestigiousness is for the whiteness of silver, and above his charity for the yellow of the gold, for God is the Almighty.He wanted him to do it, and his money is more severe.And the third: that this is the light from silver, but it will be for the birth, those who are servants, and the wonder of gold for people.The second question: The bracelet is met by the women, and it is a defect for the men, so how God mentioned the Almighty in the exposure of the desire?(Answer): The people of Heaven are a murid, young people, so they do not go away from gold and silver The people of paradise and the sabayan only, then he was overwhelmed by the memory.In the verse, another aspect, which is that the most important machine is the hand, and those bustles and the stimuli are the ones that are shed to the acquisition of divine knowledge and the lights of the steadfast A neighbor of the path of gold and silver that is shed with the crime of demands, and when these works were checked from the hand, those countries were running (P-25) (P-25) And silver, the name and the widespreads were called the wall of gold and silver, and crossed from that The surplus lights of the Samid civilization with his saying: Their Lord watered them with a purposeful drink, and in the sentence, he said it: and they are sought from the silver of a sign to the one who said: [Al -Ankabut: 69], and his saying: Their Lord broke them a drink, referring to his saying: Let us guide them, our paths [Al -Ankabut: 69], so this is a danger that has been done, and God knows best.* * His Excellency said: Their Lord watered them with an purification of purification in which they said: The first is: the exaggeration in his place is pure, then in it on this interpretation: that it is not the same: Separate as the world of world.And the second: the exaggeration in the distance from the resurrected things, meaning what the harmful hands are touched, and what the feet are improved.And the third: that it does not go to the impurity; Because she nominated a sweat from their signs, a wind is comfortable.The second saying in the purification: that it is the purification, and on this interpretation also in the verse, they are: one of them: a fighter said: He is a water on the door of paradise, from the legs God was removed from the heart, cheating, and envy of his heart, and what was in his rocks of dirt and harm.And secondly: Abu Qalbah said: The food and the drink are given, so if it is at the end of that, they will be brought up with the analogy, and they will drink, and you will be broken, and you will be broken.They are like the wind of musk, and on these two districts, the purification is purified; Because it purifies their interior from the oppressive ethical, and the harmful things, then it was said: His Almighty said: And their Lord stole them is the eye of what is the one who is the one who is the same Cavourine, gang, and album, or is this other type?We said: Rather, this is another type, and its faces are indicated by it: one of them: the payment of the ribs.And the second: He attributed this drink to itself, so he said: Their Lord watered them and that indicates a virtue in this without otherwise.And the third of it: What we have narrated is that they are presented to them, the good and the drink, so if they empty it, they will come with the purification drink, and they will be broken, and it will be purified, and it will be purified from that They are like the wind of the musk, and this indicates that this drink is a stimulant of that of the drink, and because this drink will governing the path of the drink, then this is with this A wondrous effect, which is that it makes the fence and the drink a sweat that smells of the wind of the musk, and all of that indicates the microscope.And the one that is the one: that the spirit is from the world of angels, and the excess lights are from the dignities of the angels and their greatness on these signs are similar to the fresh water that is gone.The body, and as the eyes are varying in the ripeness, the many and the power, so the propaganda of the upper lights is different, so some of them will be a caravan on the authority of the Its owner is in the world in the position of fear, cry It is Zanjabili on the virginity of free and confusion, so the owner of this situation will be a little bonds until what God Almighty is, the few wives with the rituals and the rituals of The humanity is transmitted from the rituals to the prophets, and from light to light, and there is no doubt that the causes and causes are endemic in its pursuit to the obligation of the presence that is the light of the light, As it is, if it comes to that position and drink from that drink, then that of the advanced drink, but the art; Because the light of what God has exalted is in the absence of the light of God and His greatness and greatness The cause of God is the Almighty, the remembrance of the reward for the righteousness of his saying: Their Lord stole them with an purification.(P-226)
