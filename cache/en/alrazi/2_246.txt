glorified and exalted: Did you not see the fullness of the children of Israel after Moses, when they said to my Prophet, they have a sacrifice for us.You have to fight you, not to fight, say, and we will not fight in the path of God, and we have been brought out of our paths and our children, so when the fighting was written, they are not from them, except for a few of them With the shameful, the honorable peoples, which is the name of the group, such as the people, the struggle, and the army, and the collection of it is a mother.And the origin of it is full, and they are those who fill the eyes with a hill and a narration, and it was said: They are those who fill the place if they attend, and the gospel said: Because they fill the hearts with what he needs, from their saying: The man is filled with fullness of a woman, and he is darkened.* * * His Excellency said: As they said to a prophet to them, we will send us in the verse: With his saying: They fought in the path of God [Al -Baqarah: 190] Then he commanded spending in it because of his influence in the aspect of what is meant by the fighting, he mentioned the story of the sons of the children, With the fighting, they became and violated, and God Almighty has forgiven them, and attributed them to injustice, and what is meant by him is not to provide those who are commanding to fight from this mother, and the mother of the mother, They are stated in the fighting with God Almighty.* * * Because the intended is the desire in the chapter of jihad, and that is not different, but it is known who is the Prophet and who is full of frequent news, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is It is beneficial except for the suspicion, and among them is those who said: He is the son of Nun bin Fariam ibn Yusuf, and the evidence is upon him the saying of the Almighty: from the aftermath of Moses, and this is a weak As the communication is limited, the acquisition takes place after a time, and among them is those who said: The name of that was the prophet, the most honorable of the sons of Harun, and his name is the Arab: (P-145) Al-Saddi: He is a candle, his mother named him with that, because she called God Almighty to give her a son God Almighty has called it, so Shammun called him the hearing of its supplication in it, and the Sunnah will make a shin with the Hebrew, and it is from the son of Lawy ibn Yaqoub.The third question: He said Wahb and Al -Kalbi: The sins were many in the children of Israel, and the sins were great in them, then they were overwhelmed by a number of them So they asked their Prophet a king that their words are continuing and gathering with their affairs, and their condition will be evaluated in the struggle of their enemy Israel with a king who is gathered upon him, to the guidance of the rulings, and the rulings are run, and a prophet obeyed by the king, and establishes their debt, and he will give them the news of their Lord.* * * As for his saying: We fight in the path of God, know that he has read (fighting) with the tenderness and reward on the answer, and by the tenderness and the lifting of it, that is, that is, that is: Or, as if it was said: What do you do with the king, they said: We fight, and read with the fulfillment and the reward on the answer, and by raising it on the authority of it: Has you said if you have written to the fighting that you will not fight in it.Al -Mashwarhah, and the face of a navigational reader that the son of Al -Arabi told them that they say: He is a good thing in this and this is strengthened (you are) with the bridge of the cinema, not to see that Free and laughing?And Abu Ubaidah stabbed in this reader and said: If it is permissible for that, he would be rewarded (the Lord of your Lord), he answered the companions of a farewell from him from his faces: It was received in the memorization of it, the type of shaft and hardship, and the ya is not from (Asi) as well, because it is if it is in the book, J, but it is in the word, and it is not the same Other lightness.And the second answer: He endowed that the measurement requires the permissibility (Asem of your Lord), except that we mentioned that they are two languages, so he may take the two languages, and he will be used in the two times, so he can do so in the way Another position.The second question: the news of (Is it?In the sense that I signed your cheese from the fighting, and he entered (do), in order to understand what he signed with him and Mudkon, and he wanted to do so, and he is not.He is his being, and that he is a friend in his closure as his saying: Is he coming to the human being at the time of the ever, with the reports, and then it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the people God, and this indicates a strong guarantee, and

famous is that it is said: What do you do like that?It is not said: What do you do like that?He said: What do you have for you, do not hope for God and dignity [Noah: 13] and he said: What you do not believe in God [Al -Hadid: 8].The answer is from two voices: the first: It is the saying of the mighty: that (what) in this verse is an unjust, as if he said: We do not leave the fighting, and on this way.(P-146) The second face: that we will be delivered that (what) is in the sense of the confession, then on this saying, the first: the first: the fear: (that) is not the same: This is weak, because the saying is the determination of the increase in the words of God, the disagreement of origin.The second: Al -Farah said: The words are our pregnant women in the sense, because your saying: What you do not fight?It is: What does it prevent you from fighting?When he went to the meaning of the prohibition, it was good for (that) in it.The third: Al -Kisaâ€™i said: The meaning of what we do not fight: What thing we have to leave to fight?Then the word (in) was placed, and Abu Ali al -Farisi suggested the saying of al -Kisi on the saying of the deceased.And appreciation: what prevents us from fighting, if it is necessary to add the ritual rituals on the two words, then on the saying of Al -Kasayi, the memorization remains with this guarantee, and it is on this.Farah does not remain, so the saying of Al -Kasayi was not a first and stronger.As for his saying: When the fighting was written on them, they knew that in the words, he is omitted in the words: He asked God, so that he will be exalted, so he sent to them, and he sent to them.They took over.As for his saying: Except a few of them, they are those who crossed the river and their remembrance will come, and it was said: The number of this few was three and three of the thirteen and the same In the shadow, that is, he is a scholar of whom he has unjust himself when he is afraid of his Lord, and he did not fulfill what was said of his Lord, and this is the one who indicates that this is the same The path of God, as if he was a highness, and that he must have mentioned the story of the children The unjust deserves it, and this is clear in his being, as a result of that in the future, and in his place, he is sent to jihad, and that every Muslim will be fulfilled And God knows.
