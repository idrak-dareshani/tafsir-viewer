The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: They said that God took a son of his grace, but he has what is in the heavens and the earth, each of whom has the same as the heavens of the heavens and the earth.Know that this is the adult type of the veils of Jews, Christians, and the participants, and know that the phenomenon said that the Almighty said: And they said that God took to him that he is a good man.I am darkened by those who prevented the mosques of God, and we have mentioned that some of them are interpreted by the Christians, and among them is those who interpreted it on the partners of the Arabs, and we have come to us These are the same as the birth of God.Because the Jews said: The son of the son of God, and the Christians said: The Christ is the son of God, and the Arabs are the Arabs.Al-Taqirat, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: It was descended (P-22) in Kaab ibn Al-Asharf, and Kaab ibn Asad, and the son of Yahuh God, as for His Excellency: Glory be to Him, it is a word that is hidden by him, and his souls will be removed from what they said, as he said, as he said in another position: He appeared, and once, he was confined to him for the words of the words to him, and he took this eagerness to say: Rather, he has what is in the heavens and the land [Al -Baqarah: 116] The corruption of their faces of faces: the first: that everything except the duty is possible for itself, and every possible self -esteem, and every modern is a juvenile Witnesses, and the creature is not a child, but that what is only the duty is possible for itself, because it is that there is a man who is in the same way Witnesses, and each one of them is distinguished from the other, with the appointment, and what the shame is unlikely, other than what is permissible, and it is necessary to install each one of them, and each of them is one of them, Permanent to every one of its parts, and every one of its parts is other than it, so every compound is that it is separated to otherwise, and all of it is a lack of it.One of the two dutys of them is possible for themselves, this is backward, then we say: If every one of you is the reward, the one who is the one who is the same It is led to a compound of other parts, and that is referred, and with Tsalim that it is not referred, so the intended is a habit; Because every multiplication, then it is necessary for it, then the one is that if it is a duty of its pleasures, it was a compound on what you have proven, then the ritual is a ride, and this is a successor, and this was a successor, and this is a successor The perpetrator is the most powerful, and you have proven this betting that all that is the duty of the obligatory is possible for its own, and all of it is possible for it, and it is the same, and it is possible for it to be And that influenced that influence in it is either the case His promise or the state of his existence, if the first is the one who is updated, and if the second is, then the need for that supply to the influencer, either that it is the case of his condition, The first is referred; Because it requires finding the existence, so the second is appointed, and that requires that of that, it is possible to happen, so it has proven that everything except God is an updated, and that is the same, Rather, he obtained the creation of God Almighty, his creation, and his creativity, so it was proven that everything that he has, then he is his servant and his king, so it is possible for him to be something that is for him, and this is what he has, Rather, we benefited from his saying: Rather, he has what is in the heavens and the earth, meaning: He has everything that he has on the path of king, creation, creation and creativity.The second: that this is added to him that he was his son either that he is an eternal or modernist in an eternal, then if he was not an eternal, then we will make us, and he will make us.The opposite, then that judgment is a ruling that is repeated from the same indication, and if the child is a heated, it was a creature of that valid and a servant for him, so he will not be.The third: The child must be from the gathering of the father, and if we had imposed for him a son, he would have been shared by some of the faces, and it is distinguished from him One of them is installed and updated, and that is referred, so the ears of the craftsmanship is obedient, for the parents are obedient.The quarter: The boy is taken for the need for him in the oldest, and the hope of the intended with the case of the father’s cushioning from the things of his soul, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this one, so he finds this Poverty, reward and need, if all of that is referred to, was the finding of the child on him, and he is referred to him, and he knows that he is the one who said in the places of a lot of people They add to him the children - their saying, and they have been involved in this argument, which is that everyone in the heavens and the land is a servant for him, and that if he is a command, then he will say: In Mary: That Jesus, the son of Maryam, said the truth in which they are passed (P-23), what God had to take from the son of His grace if he is a matter of order, but he will say: 35] He also said in the last of this surah: They said that the mercy took a son [Maryam: 88].They called for the Most Merciful as a son, and what is empty of the Most Merciful is to take a son that everyone is in the heavens and the earth, except for the mercy of a servant [Maryam: 89-93] This verse is a money for what is in the heavens and the earth, and in the Surah of Mary in his formation of money for those in the heavens and the earth on what he said: Everyone is in the heavens [Maryam: 93] We said: His exalted say in this surah: Rather, he has what is in Smiles and earth - complete; Because the word “what“ does not take over all the things, * * * As for his words, he is up to him: He all have a loyalty, and he has angom: Four faces: obedience, as a saying: Yamarim, I am sure of your Lord [Al -Imran: 43], and the length of resurrection, as his saying, peace be upon him, who said: “The length of the channel”, and in the sense of silence, as Zayd ibn Arqq said: We were speaking in the prayer until we said his saying: “And they will be to God.” So we grabbed us from the words, and it is in the sense of the permanent, if you know this, then say: Some of the interpreters said: Everyone has it, that is: everything in the heavens, And the notes in “every” compensation for the added to it, and it is the saying of Mujahid and Ibn Abbas.They obey the day of resurrection, and it is the saying of the sedity, so he said to this: This is the description of the cost So they made the channels with another wings: the first: it is a witness to the existence of the Creator, the grace of it, in the effects of the industrialization and the emirates of al -Haddah and al -Qaddah.The second: the color of all of its king in the king of his abundance, in which it is shown in how it is heard, and it is the saying of my father is a Muslim, and on these two, the verse is general.The third: He wanted the angels, Azir and Al -Masih, meaning: each of these people who judged them with the son that they have said to him, he said to me, he said to me, he said to me.For some Christians: if not to be repeated from the worship of God, I would not be on his religion, so Al -Nasrani said: How can it be attributed to that to Jesus, with the authority May God be pleased with him: If Jesus is a god, then God is how he worshiped others, but the servant is the one who is fit for the servants, so Al -Nasran cuts.The second question: when the channel was in the origin of the language, a phrase for the permanence, the meaning of the verse was that the inhabitants of the places and their compassion - with it, are the same and for the sake of it His survival and his receptor needed it to him, and it is up to him, so she stated that the subject requires that his need not be cut off from the influencer, neither in the case.The third question: It is said how to come with “what” that is not the first of knowledge, with his saying: they said, his answer: as if he came with “what is“ without ”.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: the sake of the heavens and the earth has the names: the first question: the obedience and the creator in one means.Al -Qaflal said: It is like a dream in the sense of a painful and wise in the sense of a judge, so that it is not in a way that is exaggerated for the enemy in it, and that it indicates that it is not possible.It is possible that it is from it Creativity, so it is in a loud and hearing hlopic, and he may come in a sense of creativity, creativity, and the opposite of (P-24) creativity is the one who is the one who is the same People call those who said or do what was not before him.The second question: Know that this is from the first words of the words; Because he is upset, he said: Rather, he has what is in the heavens and the earth, so he explained that he is a money for what is in the heavens and the earth, and then he showed that he is the money, and the lashes are also for the sake It is how the thing is deposited and said: And if he is spent, then he says to him that he will be in it and in it: This is why it was gathered on a judgment as a cover and a cover, and in the case of the judge, and the collection of the issues, and its adultery is an act of the installation of the “s” and the origin of it ” After the increase of the thousand, she turned and turned a thousand, and then when she met, she was a thousand active thousand, she turned a gambling of the abuse of the two people, and from the one who is noticeable I went and came, and the watering and the healing, from I watered and heal, and the evidence on the authenticity of the ya without the gossip, its steadfastness in the most of the words of the word, you say:...To my judgment, judge and judge, and they are spent, and you are spent, and the two days are and they are spent, and they are spent, and you are spent The origin that is indicative of his installation is the meaning of the piece, from that saying: The judge decreed that so that so and so in this judgment if he ruled; Because it is a chapter of the pretext, and this is said: a ruler, and he will reach it if he is a residence for the rituals.Ibn al -Anbari narrated that the people of the language said that they said: He interrupted it from the needy, and paid it from it, and he spent his debt if he led him to him, as if he had cut the litigant and the abandonment of his soul, or he was cut off from him, and he said: The matter, if he fulfilled it and judged it, and from it, the Almighty said: So they spent seven heavens [Chapter: 12] and it is from this; Because in the completion of the work, he cut off it and a void of it, and from it: a drain of judgment, whoever spent it if he ruled it and the work of it comes, and as for their saying: the satisfaction of it, and the one who died, then he died, He killed him, so he is a metaphor of what was mentioned, and the whole of them is an apparent, and as you spend the bazi, it is not from this composition, and what is supported by that is the significance Pupping on him, which is the judge and the distress.Hand, cutting, fissure, clips, and demolitions are close, and the distress and what is derived from it So, his affliction is in the sense of cutting, and that is that the thing if it is cut off or on the opposite, and what is confirmed is that what is closer to this is the same The piece: the first of it: he folded it if he cut it, and the moisturizing rod; Because it is caught any cut, called the source, and the penis: the branch, an effective in the sense of a verb, and the ritual is what it cares for it like a managing.And the second: the ritual, which is the one with the parties of the teeth; Because there is a piece in it for the eaten, and a roll of a penalty: in his part of breaking and leaving it.And the third of it: the penis, which is the accuracy, a penis is said, meaning: a slim; Because the few are the causes of cutting.And its seller: the ritual is a verb, which is corruption.Speech in its original concept according to the language.The second question: In the bearers of the memorization of the judiciary in the Qur’an, they said: It is used on its faces: one of them: in the sense of creation, the saying of the Almighty: They created them.And the second: in the sense of the matter, Tala'al said: Your Lord has decreed that you will not worship him except for him [Al -Israa: 23].And the third: in the sense of judgment, and this is what is said to the referendum: the judge.(P-25) and its elevation: in the sense of the news, Tala'al said: We spent us to the children of Israel in the book [Al-Israa: 4] meaning: We told them, and this comes with a decision with “to”.Fifth: that he comes in the sense of emptiness from the thing, he said: “When he spent a guardian to their people, those who were warned [Al -Ahqaf: 29], he means when he emptied, and he said: She was equal to the quality [Hood: 44] means emptying from the infidels of the disbelievers, and he said: To spend their spoilers [Hajj: 29] in the sense that they will be empty of it, then if it is known, then it is: An order [Al -Imran: 47] It was said: If he created something, and it was said: He ruled that he does something, and it was said: He judged an order, the poet said: “They have two sins, or two of them.” The third question is followed: they agreed on the fact that the matter is a truth in the special saying, and is it a truth in the verb and the right?Yes, and it is intended to do it, and simply the saying in which it is mentioned in the origins of jurisprudence.The following question: Ibn Amir read: “Be“ with the installation in all Qur’an except in two places: in the first of the Amran: Be in the right: Be the truth of the truth [Al -Anam: 73], then he raised them, and on the authority of the sake in the beekeeping, and by raising the Qur’an, the Qur’an, and the one in the Qur’an, and the rest of the Qur’an, The monument is on the answer to the matter, and it was said: It is far, and the lifting of the abuse, that is: it will be.The fifth question: Know that it is not what is meant by the Almighty saying: Rather, he says to him that he will be [Al -Imran: 47] is that he says: “Be” That thing, If that is a pardon, and the one who indicates his faces: the first: that his saying: be, then it is either to be old or modern, and the pivotal is a pioneer, so he said: The pollution of things on “be”, but we said: It is not permissible for it to be a valid for its faces: the first: that the word “be” is a compulsive memory of the coffin, the coffin, the coffin, the coffin, the coffin, the coffin.On the noun, the noun for its formation is preceded by all, it must be modern, and it is enough for its being ahead of the event with one of the modernity, and it is necessary.The second: that the word “if“ “does not enter into the path of the future, then that judiciary must be offered and be modern; Because he entered a letter on him, "and" and saying it, "be" arranged on the judiciary with the fulfillment of the punishment; Because he is upset, he said: But he says to him be, and the delay of the hadith is a modern, so it is impossible to be “be”.The third: He has arranged the formation of the creature on his saying, “Be“ with the fulfillment of the punishment, so it will be his saying “be” is based on And the one who is presented to the event with one time that it must be an event, so he said, “Be“ it is not permissible to be an estimated, nor is it permissible as well that it will be.” Speaking; Because if every hadith was destroyed to his saying “be“ and his saying “be“ it was also an update, then it is necessary to be a disobedience “be“ to ”be another, Dura, and they are referred, and have proven this evidence that it is not permissible to stop the events of the juveniles on his saying, “Be”.The second pilgrimage: It is an either to address the creature with “be” before his entry into existence, or if he entered the existence, and the first is false; Because the rhetoric of the enemy is the same as his fool, and the second is also false; Because he is returning to the habit of being that he is the one who is supplied to become a struggle, and that is also not in it.The third pilgrimage: that the creature may be a gone, and the adaptation of the beauty is a vast, and it is not appropriate for the wise.The fourth pilgrimage: that the Qadir is the one who is valid from the verb and left it according to the wills, so if we are supposed to be the murdered (P-26), it is separated from the saying of it.It can be able to find and events, or it is not possible, for if it is not possible, the creation is not based on his saying, “Be”, and if he could not be able to do so Al -Qadir will be able to do the action except when you speak to him by “be”, so he returns to the matter until you heard the ability to “be”, and that is a conflict.The fifth pilgrimage: that “be” if he had an effect on forming, then if we spoke to this word, then this is the effect of that, and that is the effect of that So our knowledge is that it does not affect this word.The sixth pilgrimage: “Be” a compounded word of kaf and noun, on the condition of the cuff of the kaf, advanced on the noun, so the influencer is Either it is one of these two letters or their entirety, if the first was not the word “be” the impact of a lab, but the effect of this is the one who is the one who is the effect, and this is the effect of this.The second is referred; Because there is no existence for this group.Because when the first letter was received, the second was not the second, and when the second came, then the first was lost, and if the group was not for the group, and it is the same The impact of the milk.The next argument: His Exalted: The example of Jesus with God, as the same as Adam, created him from the dust, and then he said to him that he would be [Al -Imran: 59] It is delayed from his creation, as the one who is delayed from the thing is not influenced by the presumption of it, so we have known that it does not influence the saying of it.So he appeared in this face, and the corruption of this gold, and if this is proven, then he said: It is necessary to be interpreted, and it is from the faces: the first: which is the strongest, that the intended is from this The permeability of God in the formation of things, and that it is the Almighty creates things, not with thought, suffering, and anguish, and his counterpart is the saying of the exalted, and he said: For it, and for the land, they have a volume or a hatred.Authenticity and defense, and his counterpart is the saying of the Arabs: The injustice said to the supply: Why do you not be tired?He said: Whoever is tired of me, for those who are behind me, what I have left behind, and his counterpart, his saying is up to the Almighty: And that there is nothing but praise with his praise, but you do not agree.The second: It is a mark that God Almighty does for the angels, if you hear it, know that it is a matter of something, and that is told about the father of Al -Hudhal.The third: It is specific to the ones who have said to them: They are a vast apest monkey [Al -Baqarah: 65] and whoever runs their wages, and he said the deaf.The lord: It is a matter of life with death and the death of life, and everyone is weak, and the strong is the first.
