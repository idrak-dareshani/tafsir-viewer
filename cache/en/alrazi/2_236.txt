The Quranic researcher, the fifteenth judgment, is the ruling of the divorced before the entry, there is no wing to you.The expanded is destined and on the one who is able to be known to the well -known, the Almighty said: There is no wing for you, if you divorced the women, and they did not They have a satisfactory and their use of the expanded, and on the one who is able to be able to know the well -known, the best of the well -known is the best of the divisions: The divorced woman who is the outbreak of it and its entry into it, and God has mentioned the exalted, while the rulings of this section are presented, which is that it is not taken from them, the one who is on the authority of the darkness, Then, he was told that they have the fullness of the skillful, and that their counters are three readers.The second section of divorced women: what is not an exhibitor or an entry into it, and it is what God has mentioned in this verse, and he mentioned that there is no skillful, and that it is a skillful.The third section of divorced women: which is the supply of it, but it is not entered into it, and it is the one who is mentioned in the verse that is after this verse, and it is the one who says: And if you divorced them before they touched them, and you have been satisfied with them, and we will describe what you have imposed [Al -Baqarah: 237] and know that he is the Almighty.And he mentioned in the surah of the parties that there is no number for them to be at all, and he said: If the believers are married and then you divorced them before you touched them, then they are not for you, so they do not.They enjoyed them [the parties: 49].His saying: So what you have enjoyed from them, so they would have their wages [Al -Nasa: 24] Also, the glorious measurement is indicative of it; This is because the nation is collected on the fact that the severity of the likeness is the skill of the example, so the one who is a valid marriage is a valid one with this judgment, so this is the ruling, so this is the ruling, so this is the ruling, so this is the ruling, so this is the rule of this The intended from this verse, and it can be expressed by this division with another burden, and it is said: The contract of marriage is obligatory in every case, and that is in every case Male or other than a masculine, if the substitutes are mentioned, then the entry is settled all, and this is the ruling of the divorced woman who is the one who mentioned it.The verse, and if the income does not get the half of the release of divorce, and this is the ruling of the divorcees that God has mentioned in the verse that comes.If the substitute is not mentioned, then the income does not get, then it is this divorced who is the one who mentioned God Almighty in this verse, and there is no ruling, and there is no ruling, and there is no ruling, and there is no ruling, It is upon it, and it is obligatory for it The one who is used, and if the income obtains its judgment, it is not mentioned in these verses, except that they agreed on that the duty is in them the skill of the example, and when this is the authority of this Let us return to interpretation.As for the saying of the Almighty: There is no wing to you, if you divorced women, then this is a text that the divorce is permissible, and I know that many of our companions are in order to hold this in this way The three are not forbidden, they said: Because his saying: There is no wing to you, if you divorce women, all the types of divorces will take place A wing of you if you divorced women unless you divorced them three divisions, for if there is the wing, they said: The ruling of the triumph is the one who has been given, so it is not for him to enter.His saying: There is no wing to you, if you divorced women, all kinds of launching, means the state of individuals and the state of gathering, and this is the reason for me to be lost; That is because the verse is indicative of the permission in the acquisition of this thing in the provision, and it is sufficient to work with it in the presence of time, one time It is beneficial to the ribs, and this is what we said: If he says to his woman: If you enter the house, then you are divorced, then you will be held at the same time.It was proven that this memorization does not take over the condition of the group, and as for the discretion that he mentioned, then he says: This is formed by the matter, then it does not benefit the righteousness, With it, it is correct to say: He prayed except in the ilateral time, and stigmatized except in the Fallow day, and God knows.* * * As for his words, the Exalted: What they did not touch in it is two questions: the first question: Read Hamza and Al -Kisayi, “Tasham,” by the thousands of the effects, and for you, and for you, and for you “Treat them” without a thousand, the pilgrimage of Hamza and Al -Kisa’i that every one is touched by the religion of his owner and all the consequences of all, and it also indicates that They seek [the argument: 3] and it is a gathering, and the argument of the rest of them is their gathering on his saying: and I did not touch me with human beings [Al -Amran: 47], and because the most of this is in this sense of this meaning in this meaning came to me With an action without acting, as his saying: They did not reassure them [Al -Rahman: 56], and his saying: So they marry them with the permission of their people [the people: 25] Cemetering, and that is the action of the man, and it is indicated in the second verse that what is meant is from this misfortune, and as for what came in Al -Zahhar from his words, the Almighty is: before he is a good thing Which is unanimous, and it is forbidden in Al -Zahhar, and some of those who have read: Because he has been intended for him to do; Its saying: I ran the thief, and I punished the thief, which is a lot.* * * (P-117) The wing is from the divorced woman, who is ahead of the politician, and not like that; It is not a wing, too, after the politician.His answer is from his faces: The first: that the verse indicates the permissibility of divorce before the politician is divorced, and this release is not fixed after the politician; It is not permissible to divorce after the politician in the time of menstruation, nor in the purification in which it is in it, so when the mentioned in the verse was the solution of divorce on the divorce, and the solution of the divorce, and the solution of the divorce, and the solution of the divorce, and the solution of the divorce, and the solution of the divorce, Except with the condition of the pretext of the politician, the appearance of the memorization is true.The second face: In the answer, some of them said: (What) is in his saying: They did not touch them in the sense of (the one) and the appreciation: there is no ward to you, if you divorced you (What) a rigid name that does not know, and does not show the Arabs nor the number, and on this estimation it is not the case (what) is conditional, so the question is still.The third face: In the answer, what is going on around the lock, may God have mercy on him, and he gets it back to what I say, which is that what is meant from the wing is in this verse, so the abundance of the ritual The verse: There is no skill for you, if you divorced women, what you did not touch or overlook them with a satisfaction, in the sense of: the skill is only obligatory with one of these, then this is the same It is obligatory for the skill, and this is an apparent words, except that we need to say that it said: There is no wings with no skill, so we say: the release of the wing of the wing on the one It is obligatory for him, and the destiny is obligatory to him, and as for the two sides, it is that the origin of the wing in the language is the minimum, it is said: The ship was wrap In it from the heels, the Almighty said: Let them carry their weights and the weights with their weights [Al -Anakbout: 13] If it is proven that the wing is the heart, and the money of the money is necessary, then it is a sag The memorial is a reserved for him, but we said: The evidence indicates that it is what is meant by Jajhin: The first: that he is upset, he said: There is no wing to you, if you divorced the insults, or they did not.They have a satisfactory, the exile of the wing is limited to an end, and it is either the politician or the abuse, and the estimation: it is obligatory to prove that wing at the same time.The wing that proves at one of these two things is the necessity of the skilled, so the piece is obligatory by the fact that the exile in the first verse is the necessity of the skilled.The second: that the wearing of the women before the politician on two sections: one of them: which is before the politician and before the exaggeration of the skill, which is the remembrance in this.The second: which is before the politician and after the estimation of the skilled, and it is the one who is mentioned in the verse that after this verse, and it is his saying: And if you divorced them from them You have been satisfied with them [Al -Baqarah: 237] Then in this division, it is required for the references to the supplies, and this section is like the opposite That is why the oath is necessary for the exile, there is the proven here, and when the stabilizer here is the necessity of the skillful, it must be said: the exile is the exile And God knows.And I know that we have mentioned at the first interpretation of this verse that the divorced sections are four, and this verse is that it is divided into the rule of three of the three of them; Because when the estimation of the verse has become: there is no skill except when the politician or when it is estimated, it is known that that the one who is not entertained, or the exhibits, is not a matter That is the one who is enlightened and does not be an exhibitor, and which is the supply of it and does not be a touch that must be for each one of them the skillful Including the ruling of these three sections.(P-118).The advanced, and on this estimation, these verses are the one that is divided into the rule of these four sections by the periphery, and this is from the sects of the words, and the words of the word.* * * The third question: Abu Bakr Al -Asam and Al -Zajaj said: This verse is indicated that the contract is a marriage without the skillful.Health, as for the two meanings of health, because if it was not correct, the divorce was not hidden, and it was not the one who is not obligatory.Because it is not necessary from the permissible health, with an indication that the divorce is in the time of menstruation is forbidden, and with that there is a sense and a health.* * * The loyal question: they agreed that what is meant is from this verse is the entry.Difficulty in the worshipers in the choice of the best of all, while they address it, and God knows.As for the saying of the Exalted: Or you will be satisfied with them, then the meaning is estimated for it in terms of the skill that is obligated to himself; Because the imposition of the language is the estimation, and a lot of many of the interpreters that “or“ here in the sense of waw, and he wants: you did not touch them and did not do so As his saying: Or increase [Safat: 147], and if you contemplate, when you have dispersed, you knew that this interpretation is a cost, but rather a mistake.As for his words, the Almighty is: and they have known that he is upset when he showed that there is no skillful when the head of the politician The recipient may be presented in his saying: Whoever enjoys Umrah to the pilgrimage [Al -Baqara: 196].* * * And in the verse: the first question: the divorced sects: divorced before the entry, and the divorce after the entry, but the divorced before the entry is not.It was imposed for it a skillful This is the verse in which we are in which we have been imposed for it, then it is not used; Because God is upholstered in its right, the half of the skilled, and the recipient did not remember, even if it was a duty to mention it.Ibn Umar said: Every divorced woman who has been imposed for it and did not enter it, according to the description of the skillful, and the divorced woman after the entry of it, or for the sake of it It is imposed, so does the one who deserves the one who says, in which he said: He said in “Al -Qadim” and with it, Abu Hanifa said: There is no use of it; Because she deserves the skillful, such as the divorced woman, after the abuse, before the income, and he said in “the new”: Rather, it has the one who is used.Ali, Ibn Umar, and the evidence upon him, the Almighty saying: The divorcees have the goods of the well -known [Al -Baqarah: 241], and he said: So, the Almighty is the one who has been.He entered the Prophet ﷺ, and it is not like the divorce after the abuse before the politician; Because she deserved the rods, not by the interview of compensation, and the recipient was not due, and the divorced woman after the entry was fulfilled by the righteousness, So the recipient is due to the grace of separation.* * * They did not see it as a duty, and it is the saying of Malik.We have the words of the Almighty: and they used to appear the matter for the positive, and he said: The divorced women have goods [Al -Baqarah: 241], so he made a king for them or in the meaning of the king, and he said that he said: The last of the verse: Really on the good, then he made this as a matter of charity, but it is said: This action is charity if it is not obligatory, for if it is obligatory for it, then it is necessary for it, then the performance of it is not.Also, Tala'al said: (P-119), what is on the good of the path [the repentance: 91], and this indicates the numbers of the garment.The answer to it is that the verse that you mentioned is denied by our saying; Because he was upset, he said: Really on the good, then he reminded him of the word “Ali” and it is for the obligatory, and because if it was said: this is a right to so -and -so.The third question: the origin of the one who is used and the enjoyment is what is beneficial to it, and it is not possible, but it is contrary to a relative, and this is said: the world is a good, and the semested, To cut it quickly and a few.* * * As for his saying, the Exalted: On the expanded, it is destined and the one who is able to do it.The man: If his money abounded and his condition is expanded, and it is said: I am as such as; That is, he expanded it on it, and it is the saying of the Almighty: We are expanded [the ahead: 47] and its saying: His estimation is that of his destiny and his energy, so he deleted the addition of the added, His poverty, which is the fold [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
