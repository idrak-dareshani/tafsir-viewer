The Quranic researcher (P-110) (Surah Al-Kawthar).Three verses, angel.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Know that this surah is on its shrouds in it for the sects: it is that this surah is like the opposite of the advanced wall, and that is because it is in the fence in the surah and the righteousness The argument with four matters: the first of them: the stinging, which is intended from its saying: it is called the orphan and does not urge the food of the mask [Al -Ma’oun: 3].The second: The prayer is left, and it is what is meant by its saying: those who are about their prayers are Sahoun [Al -Ma’oun: 5].And the third: the one who is in prayer, which is what is meant by its saying: those who are the ones who are the ones [Al -Ma’un: 6].And the fourth: the prohibited from zakat, and it is intended from its saying: and they are forbidden to the one [Al -Ma’un: 7], so he mentioned in this surah in the interview of that fourth attributes of the fourth attributes of the fourth attributes, so he mentioned the fourth attributes of the fourth.The intercourse of the misfortune is his saying: We gave you the proliferation, that is, we gave you the many, so I gave you the many and not stingy, and it was mentioned in the intercourse: the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is: 5] His saying: (Separate), that is, to pray on prayer, and he mentioned in an interview: those who are the ones who say: (To your Lord), that is, come with prayer for the pleasure of your Lord, not to the sake Conclusion: They are forbidden to say: (He fell) and wanted to believe in the sacrifice of the sacrifice, so it is considered that this is the wondrous, then the sacrifice of the sake: Your affairs are the most powerful, that is, the hypocrisy that comes with those dummy actions removed in that surah will die and do not remain a trace and no news, but you are the one who will be The beautiful, and the last reward.And the second face: in the sects of this surah that the one who wires to God Almighty has three grades: above: that (p-111) they are the ones who are used in the hearts of their hearts and the hearts of their hearts.God.And the second: that they are the users of the religious worship and worship.And the third of it: to be in the denomination of the soul from the youths to the sensual pleasures and urgent desires, so he said: We gave you the most aspect of the first point to the first His Qadisiyah spirit is distinguished from the man of the human aspects of goodness and how.The arguments are from the brightest of the souls, and the saying of it: He separated your Lord, and it is a sign of the second arrangement, and his saying: (And he fell up) a sign of the third arrangement, then the one is from The urgent pleasure is a neighbor, the journey of the sacrifice and the slaughter, then he said: Your affairs are the elderly and it is meaning that the soul that invites you to seek this sensors and the lusts, the urine, the urine, the urine, the urine, the urine, the urine, the urine, the urine, the righteousness, the righteous, Rather, the rest of the righteous are better for your Lord, which is the happiness Spiritualism and rabbi knowledge that is eternal, and let us now seek interpretation.His exalted say: We gave you the calamity, I know that there is a supplier: the first is the first: that this surah is like a fullness of what he accepted from the righteous As for the completion of the way it was accepted; Because God Almighty made Surah: (and the sacrifice) in the praise of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and detailing his conditions, so he mentioned in the beginning of the surah three things that are attached First: His saying: What your Lord called you and what he said [Duha: 2].And the second: His saying: The hereafter is better for you from the first [Al -Duha: 3].And the third of it: and for your Lord, your Lord will be satisfied, and you will be satisfied [Al -Duha: 4] Then this is the conclusion of this surah with the remembrance of three of the conditions of his states, peace be upon him, and he is the peace of God.(Did he not find you a shelter, and he found you lost, so he guided and found a family, so I sing.[Al -Duha: 6].We explain to you your chest [Al -Sharh: 1].The figs with three types of supervision: the first: that it was divided into his country, which is his saying: This is the faithful country [Al -Tin: 3].Those who believed [figs: 6].First: Read in the name of your Lord [Al -Alaq: 1] That is, read the Qur’an on the truth, seeking the name of your Lord.19].It is good for a thousand: 3: Surah: (It was not) that his nation was honored by three chapters: the first: that they are: the best of the valley [Al -Bayain: 7] and the second is that: the reward of them: May God be pleased with them.The day of resurrection is witnessed by his nation with obedience and worship.Their obedience is presented to them, so the joy and the secret will get them.The best sees [the earthquake: 7] and the knowledge of God is not doubt that it is greater than every great, so they must reach its rewards, then he honored it in the walls of the naked.So that horses are described with three characteristics: and the nakedness is a sacrifice.Then he honored his nation in Surah (Al -Qarbah) with three matters: the first: whoever is a minority of his buds.And the second: that they are in a satisfied life.And the third of it: they see their elders in a protective fire.Then he honored him in Surah (Al -Hakk) by showing that those who are exposed to his religion and his legs will become tormented by three faces: the first: that they are the first: And the second: that they see it in the eyes of the juice.And the third: They ask about the naked.Then he honored his nation in Surah (and the era) with three matters: the first of which: Faith: Except those who believe [figs: 6].And the second: and do the righteous.And the third: the guidance of creation to the righteous acts, which is the consistency of the right, and the consistency of patience.Then he honored him in the Surah of Al -Hamza by mentioning that whoever has been associated and booed, he has three types of torment: the first of them: that he does not interact with his life, and he is the one who is the one who is the same He made him all [Al -Hamza: 3, 4].And the second: it is rejected in the breastfeeding.And the third of them: that these doors are closed to it until there is no hope for him in the elderly, and it is his saying: It is an assumption.[Al -Hamza: 8].Then he honored him in Surah (the elephant) by that he responded to his enemies in their sacrifice from three of the faces: the first: he made them in misleading.And the second: He sent them a good man.And the third of it: (He made them as an eaten description).Then he honored him in Surah Quraysh that he was the sponsor of his predecessors from three of the faces: the first: he made them two compliances in the way.And the second: feed them from hunger.And the third of it: that (he believed in them).And he honored him in the wall of the one who is the one who described the lies with his religion with three types of defamatory attributes: the first: the religion and the goodness, and it is the saying of the one who says: Food of the poor [Al -Ma’un: 3].And the second: he left the glorification of the Creator, and it is his saying: about their prayers, Sahoun who are the ones who are groaning [Al -Ma’un: 5].And the third of it: the integrity of the creation, which is its saying: and they are forbidden to the one [Al -Ma’un: 6].* * * Then, he was glorified and exalted when he honored him in this light from this great face The remembrance in the advanced light that is one of them is greater than the king of the world with its duties, so I occupied the worship of this Lord, and with the guidance of his servants The worship of the Lord is with the soul, and it is his saying: He separated your Lord or with money, and it is his saying: (and he fell down), but the guidance of his servants to what is the right of them in their religion.So he said: O infidels, I do not worship what you worship [the disbelievers: 2], so you have proven that this surah is like a tuft of what he accepted from the wall, and it is like it.It is up to him after this surah that (P-113) is atoned by all the people of the world by saying: Oh, the disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship and do not worship On their doctrine and their religions are more severe than their souls on their souls and their aspirations, and so that they make their money and their souls in the support of their religion The doctrine of people enrichs the enmity and anger that does not enrich the birds of the obedience, so when he commanded him to atone for all the people of the world, and their religion is invalid In the end of the enmity for him, and that is what one of the creation is known to him, so he can hardly be presented to him, and he looks at Moses, peace be upon him, as he was afraid of his fear.As for here, the peace be upon him, when he was sought to all the people of the world, was every single of creation, as they were disbelieved in the lineage of this The most severe fear is a gentle man, which is that it was presented to that surah, this surah is that it said: (We gave you the calamity, it will remove it from that One of them: that he said: We have given you a lot, that is, the many good in the world and religion, so that it is that and a promise of God, with the victory and the sake of God.May God bless you [Al -Anfal: 64] and his saying: God protects you from people [Al -Ma’idah: 67] and his saying: Do not support Him, then God will help him [Repentance: 40] He is not afraid of anyone.In Mecca, and the successor is in the words of God, a referred to the Almighty, so it is obligatory in the ruling of God, His Excellency His Heads in the House of World, where he will pray for these goodness, so that the good is for him, so the goodness is for him, so that it is like that.They kill him, and they do not enhance him, and they do not pray for them, but his command becomes every day in the hardships and power.They gathered with him, and they said: If you do this as a request for talcum, then we will give you the money that you will make the richest of people, and if you are asking for you, the wife is not.We are asking for you, so we will make you a president on our own, so God Almighty said: We gave you the proliferation, that is, when he gave you the enemy of the heavens and the Lord, the good of the good They are deceived by their minds and their rituals.His saying: God spoke to Moses Taklaim [Women: 164], but this is honored; Because the birth, if his servant saw him with the obligatory commitment and charity, was the highest of if he saw it in this sense, but it is beneficial in the heart and removes it from the heart, So it was proven that the address of God is with him by saying: We gave you the hearts of what removes fear from the heart and the cheese from the soul, so it is the same, so this is the authority of this O infidels [the disbelievers: 1] so that it can be worked out with that hard toil and the feet on the atonement of all the world, and to show the brightness of the heart My command, so how I have been saved for you, and I gave you the many followers and feasts.The project, it is legalized in the Bayan what is related to the hearts of the heart and the inner; That is because the student is either that his request is defined by the world, or he is a student for the hereafter, but the one who demands the world is only for him, but the loss, the humiliation, the humiliation, the time, the time His destiny is to the fire, and it is what is meant from the surahs of Taba, and the one who has the last one is the greatest of his condition to make its soul like the mirror in which it is engraved, and the picnic is engraved, In the mental sciences, it is stated that the way of creation is in the knowledge of the champions on two voices: some of them know the chain of transmission, then he shed with his knowledge of his knowledge of his knowledge The highest honorable way, and some of them are reflected, and it is the way of the fans.“ Then he followed him with the remembrance of the paths of his creatures in Surah: Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clashs [Al -Falaq: 1] Then the matter was concluded with the remembrance of the paths of the human soul, This sentence is clear, it is clear when it is the interpretation of this surah on detail, so they are the one who guided the minds to the knowledge of this.In his generous book.The second is the second in its saying: We have given you the proliferation that the word: (We) is a veil that the group is intended and an angry that is intended to glorify.As for the first: it has been indicated that God is one, so it cannot be carried on the collection, unless he wants that this gift is what he seeks to get it.And the alerts who are advanced, when he asked Abraham to send you.It is what is meant by his saying: What you were in the side of the Western as we spent us to Moses [Al -Qasas: 44] and he preached to you the Christ in his saying: and the grace of the Messenger of God.As for the second: It is that it is that It is forbidden to exile, so he alerts him to the bone of giving, because the fathers are the mighty of the heavens, the earth, and the gifted from it, it is the one who refers to it.Give you and the flame is the thing that is called the multiplication, which benefits the exaggeration in the many, and when I felt the memorial with the greatness of the gifts and the wives of it, the wickedness of it is from it, and it is from it.The greatness of it, and what has been postponed, and what has the supervision of what is above.* * * The third is the third: that the guidance, even if it is a little, is that it is the cause For some of his servants on the path of dignity, this is a great dignity, not because the pleasure of guidance is in itself, but because its breasts are from the great, the great Great, so we are the proliferation, even if it is in itself in the absence of the many, but it is due to its breasts from the king of the cells, the bone and a bone.The fabrication: that when he said: (He gave you), a village with him is a sign of it that he does not return it, and that is because it is that the father of Hanifa is gone.He rejoices his mold, if he takes compensation, and if he says, he is not permissible for him to do so; Because whoever has given something to a thousand people of a person, then he was asked for a comb to be equal to a lip, so he gave it, the right of the return fell, then he said: “We have given us from the prayer.” And the sacrifice, and its benefits are the overthrow of the right to return.Fifth: that he built the verb on the beginning, and that is beneficial to the affirmation, and the evidence is upon him that you are when you mentioned the name of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one About him with an affairs, and he will be patient with a knowledge that what is told about him, so if he mentioned that news, he accepted the acceptance of the lover for his love, then he is in his love Checking and exile the suspicion, and from here, the luxury is known in its saying: It does not accommodate the sight [Hajj: 46], for it is the most luxurious of what he said: The saying of the great king is achieved for those who prepare him and guarantee him: I give you, I will be enough for you, I do your command, and that is if it is the one who is a matter The tolerance of it is the greatest of it inherits the suspicion in the one who is in it, so if it is assigned to the great caravan, then this is the doubt of this suspicion, and this is the verse of this.Something is a great thing, so the forgiveness falls with it, so when (P-115) came the beginner, and it is his saying: (I) that chain of transmission became a remover of that doubt.The sixth is the highness: that the sentence was released with the perpetrator of the ongoing affirmation of the segment, and the words of the truthful are the ones who are safe from the successor, so how if it is in the affirmation?The fabrication: He said: (Give you) and he did not say: We will give you because his saying: (Give you) is indicated by That this giving was obtained in the past, and this has types of benefits: one of them: that whoever was in the past time is ever, dear to the side of the pilgrim, who is honored, as well And for this, peace be upon him said: “I was a prophet and a long water between water and the mine.” And secondly: It is a sign until the ruling of God with happiness, sophistication, singing and hatred, is not something that is happening now, but rather he has obtained the strongest.And the third of it: as if he says: We have been the reasons for your happiness before your entry into the provision, so how do we devote your command after your existence and your servants?.And its elevation: as if it is up to say: We are what we have chosen and what we have preferred, for the sake of your obedience, otherwise it was necessary for us to give you only after your feet on the authority of you.With the gratitude of the best and the charity from us, it is not obligatory, and it is a sign of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: * * * The eighth is the eighth: He said: (Give you) and he did not say, give us the Messenger, the Prophet, the scholar, or the obedient; Because if he said, I would not feel that that giving was made by that description.The curator of the choice and the will, as he said: We divide our division [Al -Zukhruf: 32], God selects from the angels a messenger and from the people [Hajj: 75].The ninth is the ninth: He said first: We gave you and then he said secondly: So he separated your Lord and fugs, and this indicates that giving it to the success and the guidance is a predecessor for our obedience And giving him his class, and our obedience to him is our class, and the adjective of creation is not influenced in the description of the Creator, but the influence is the description of the Creator in the character of the creation, and for the sake of the creation of the creation Al -Wasiti said that he said: I do not worship a Lord who is satisfied with my obedience and his disobedience is planned, and it is meaning that his consent and his eclipse and my obedience and my disobedience are not infected with no one who has been It is a valid, but he is satisfied with the servant who carried him on his obedience while he is still, and so is the saying in the defamation and disobedience.Al -Faddah Al -Ashra: He said: He gave you the proliferation, and he did not say: We have brought you to the proliferation, and the reason for it is two things: the first: that the orphans is enticed to be a duty and that it is a duty, and it is a duty, It is more likely to say it: We have given you the proliferation, meaning: this is the many goods, which are Islam, the Qur’an, the prophecy, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the male, the one who is the one who is the one, and the remembrance of the The preference is from us to you, and nothing from it is on the way to the right and the obligatory, and it is in vain from two vicers: It does not invalidate it, but every day was more in which the second is: that what is due to the investigator, then it is estimated with the ability of the investigator, and the verb The servant is dead, so the investigator will be caused by his death, but the preference is that it is a result of the generosity of God, so it is not forbidden, so it will be the preference of it When his saying indicated: (He gave you) that it is preferred, not a merit, that is ever.If it was said: Is it not he said: Seven of the second and the Qur’an [Al -Hajar: 87]?We said: The answer is from two faces: The first: that giving requires you to be assured, (p-116) and the king caused the eternal, and the evidence is upon him that when Solomon said: Give us, then we are, or to hold it [p.39].The Qur’an: (He came to you) [Al -Hijr: 87] It is not permissible for the Prophet to hold something from him.The second: that the polytheism in the Qur’an is a polytheism in the sciences and there is no defect in it.The second face: In Bayan, the giving is not in this place of giving, is that giving is used in the few and many, God Almighty said: He gave a few and more than: 34] The great thing, God Almighty said: God bless him [Al -Baqarah: 252] And we have come to us from us.Al -Kawthar benefits the maximum of Muhammad ﷺ from his faces: one of them: it means: this is a basis like a little bit of the tip of the lineage to what is overwhelmed by you Al -Sharafa, as it includes the evil with things that are greater than this masculine.And the second: that the proliferation is a sign of water, as if it is the highest saying: water in the world without food, if the water of the water is as a result, how is the bridge of the naked?.And the third of it: that the water of the water is given and giving the paradise to come.And his lords: as if he is the Almighty saying: This is the one who gave you, and if it is a multiplication, but it is in your right to give, not to come; Because it is without your right, and in the habit that the Mahdi, if it is great, is the guidance, even if it is great, except that it is said: It is a despicable, that is, it is a scalp with the lineage of the lime of the bone, so it is the same Here.Fifth: to say: He said when he gave him from the catastrophe, give you; Because it is a world, and the Qur’an is a gift because it is a religion.And its sixth: as if he says: All of what you have given me is a gift, even if you are as a result, but the greatest is that of that This is the proliferation, but the remaining remembrance and the nail on the enemy is not good for giving it only after the advancement with a pain that you get from you: So pray to your Lord, and to the one who is permitted to me After the worship, I answered my generosity that after every satisfaction, it is an admired call, as was the narration of the hadith in the hadith The chain of transmission, then I respond, and your characteristic becomes overburdened, and it is the orphan, so this is what is dangerous in the interpretation of his saying: “We have given you the same From the many, which is the excessive in the many, it was said to Arabism, whose son returned from travel, with the father of your son?She said: Father with a lot, that is, with many multiple, and it is said to the many giving men: as a majority, Al -Kumayt said: ؎ You are a lot, O son of Marwan, and the father of good As a lot and it is said to the dust if it is taken and a lot, this is the meaning of the proliferation in the language, and the victims differed in it in it on the faces of it: The author and successor is that it is a river in paradise, Anas narrated from the Prophet ﷺ He said: (“I saw a river in paradise, the rugs of the domes In a way, I said, I said: What is this?As the ears of the baking of those who eat from that bird and drink from that water, he won the satisfaction." The flow of heaven has exploded from it, as it was narrated that there is no two gardens, except in it from the river is a running river, or for the many who are drinking from it, or for the many of them Peace be upon him: “It is a river and a lion of my Lord, in which there is a lot of good.” The first is to be said: Perhaps the river is erected in the basis, or perhaps the rivers, but it is liquidated from that (P-117), the basis, so that this is the basis of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who says They said: Because this surah is a response to those who blamed him, peace be upon him.The family of the house, then the world is filled with them, and it did not remain from the children of illiteracy in the world, one who is tired of it, then look at how they were from the oldest of the people and the people of the old And contentment, peace be upon them and the Zakat soul and their proverbs.The loyal saying: the proliferation of the scholars of his nation, which is the most good age; Because they are like the sons of the children of Israel, and they love the remembrance of the Messenger of God ﷺ and spread the effects of his religion and the flags of his law, and the likeness of the suspicion was that the angels were over.The origins of the knowledge of God are different in the project, mercy on the creation, so that every one will reach what is its goodness, as well as the scholars of his nation, who are agreed upon, with the wickedness of his family.But they are different from the law of the law, mercy on the creation, then the guidance is from two faces: one of them: that it is narrated that he is coming The day of resurrection is every prophet and followed by his nation, as the Messenger comes with him and the man and men with him, and every scholar of his nation comes to the nation They gather with the Messenger, and they may increase the number of followers of some scholars on a number of followers of a thousand prophets.The second face: that they were captains of their followers of the texts taken from the gay, and the scholars of this nation are the calamities with the hardships of the The one said: If some of them are wrong, but the wrong is also the wage of the fifth saying: the proliferation is the prophecy, and there is no doubt that the good is the good; Because it is the home that is secondary.And for this, he said: Whoever obeys the Messenger, he has obeyed God [Women: 80] and he is the dominance of faith, but it is like a branch in the knowledge of God Almighty; Because the knowledge of the prophecy is inevitable and that it is presented with the same knowledge of God and His knowledge and his ability and his wisdom, then if the knowledge of the Prophet is obtained from it The knowledge of the rest of the characteristics, such as hearing, eyesight, and good characteristics, and the presence of the saying of some of them, our messenger was made from this one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the most abundant.Because it is mentioned before the path of the prophet and the impermissibility after them, then he is shattered to the two grooves, and he is the one who wores before all the prophets, and it is not permissible for the sake of the evil.We copy it, and its virtues are more than that it is considered and counting, and let us remember here a little of it, so we say: * * * * The book of Adam, peace be upon him, was the words of what he said: His Lord is a word [Al -Baqarah: 37] and the book of Abraham also was the words of what he said: And when Abraham was affected by his Lord with words [Al -Baqarah: 124] and the book Moses was Sahraf, as he said: [Al -Ala: 19] As for the book of Muhammad, peace be upon him, it is the book that is devoted to all.And he said: They were granted with the names of these [Al -Baqarah: 31] and Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is a limit by the systems: Say when you are gathered in human and the elderly: God honored him that he touched his travel on the water, and he did in Muhammad ﷺ what is greater than him, narrated that “the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was on the authority of the water of the water He said: If you are honest, let that stone, which is on the other side, let him be praise and not to be overwhelmed, so the Messenger indicated to him, so he said: Until the Messenger of the Messenger, peace be upon him, became among him, and he testified to him, and the Prophet said: The Prophet said: He is enough for you?Prayer and peace be upon him, so he returned to his place.The fire has a cold and peace, and he did in the right of Muhammad greater than that, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Hatib, who said: “ So my mother carried me to the Messenger ﷺ and said: This is the son of Hatib, who was burned as it was seen, and it came (P-118).The dress was shouted, the Lord of the people, so I became correct, not a bad thing in me.What is between the sky and the earth, and the water has died for him from the stone, and he died for Muhammad, who made him eyes, and Moses honored that he was shaded upon him, and so, and so He shades him, honored Moses with the white child, and honored Muhammad with greatness than that, which is the great Qur’an, whose light arrived in the horn Abo Jahl is to throw him with the stone, he saw his shoulders two fabrics, so he spent a pasture, and the mountains praised with David, and the slaughter of it was in the hands of it.He grabbed the Hadid, and it was when he wiped the nomadic sheep, she died, and he honored David with a muddy, and praised with the righteousness, and the honor of Jesus, peace be upon him.By the time of that when the Jews added it to the poisoned shell, when he put the peak in his mouth, his informing of it, and the exoneration of the greatest and the ritual, " It was a patch, and it doubted that to the Messenger ﷺ, and the Messenger of God wiped over it with a branch, so God went to the park.With her to the Messenger of God ﷺ, and he turned it into her place, and Jesus was known to what people hide in their homes, and the Messenger recognized what his uncle hid with the mother For that, and Solomon, God Almighty replied to him the sun once, and he did that as well as the Messenger when he slept and headed in the stone of Ali Until he prayed, and he returned it once for me, he prayed the era in his time, and Solomon taught the brightness of the bird, and he did that in the right of Muhammad He made it an alienation on his head and spoke to him, and he said: Which of you was painful with her son?Solomon honored his path as a month and honored him with the walk to the house of the sacred in an hour, and his life was chaste, sending him to whom he wants, and he wants to come to him.It is a matter that she was assassinated, and that they are not able to go to it, and he went to it, and when he saw him, she was subjected to him, and he sent a maximum to some of the aspects, so when he arrived, then he arrived, so he arrived to That is not resurrected to return And he said: The Messenger of the Messenger of God, so that he will be sacked, and as he went to Selman, so they were criticized by Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: Until this lizard believes in you, then the lizard spoke to you, with his prestige, and when the antelope is released when the Arabs sent it, I returned to the one who came back to the time The hanna was for his dances, and when the life was followed by the honesty of the friend in the laurel, she said: I was a longing for him for such two years, so why did he do so?.And the many creation, from the few food, and its miracles is more than that it is counting and prepared, for this, God presented him with those who have chosen them, and he said: And he said: And he said: And from you and from Noah [Al -Ahzab: 7] So when you were sending it as well, it is permissible for God to call it, the Almighty, and he said: We have given you a lot.* * * The sixth saying: The proliferation is the Qur’an, and its virtues are inconsistent, even if it is in the land of a tree of pens [Luqman: 27] Say, if the sea was a supply of the words of the Lord [109].The following saying: the proliferation of Islam, and it is the most important life of the good, for it is the good of the world and the last, and in its sins it misses the good of the world, and the best of the world is not, and the best of the world is not, and not Alabia?Or it is necessary for it to be known, he said: Whoever provides the
