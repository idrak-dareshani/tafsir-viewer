The researcher is the Almighty: they deceive God and those who believe and what they deceive except for themselves and what they feel in their hearts are sick, so God increased them They lie to know that God is the highest of the two of the hypocrites of four things: one of them: what he mentioned in this verse, which is that they deceive God and those who are good He knows first: What is the deception, then second: What is meant by the deception of God?Third: Why did they deceive God?And in the way: What is meant by saying it and what they are deceived except for themselves?(P-57) The first question: Know that there is no suspicion that the cheek is defamatory, and the slander must be distinguished from otherwise, so that it is not done, and the origin of this, The cheeky tank was called, and the cheeks are raging in the neck; Because they were hidden, and they said: The lizard deceived a deception if it is hidden in his burial, so he only appeared, and a little way is a cheek and a deception, if it is contrary to the one who does not have a purpose The deception, and its limit is the appearance of what is delusional of peace and payment, and the grace of what is necessary for the contrary to others and the sauce of it, so it is the house of hypocrisy in the disbelief and the generosity in the disbelief in the disbelieve Unlike what the debt requires; Because the religion requires righteousness and the enemy from the voices and the insult, as it is required to be saved to God Almighty in worship, and from this gender and their description of the one who is the one who is the same Its intended, and it is taken into account in the hadith; Because the anguish delusions the hearing from whom he has not heard, and if he declares that, it is not said that he is a slave.The second question: It is how they are deceived by God Almighty?So he said that he said: The deception of God is a miraculous one from Jahin: The first: that he is the highness of the conscience and the bridges, so it is not permissible to deceive; Because those who did it, if they appeared that the inner is the disagreement of the phenomenon, it was not a deception, so if God is exalted, he is not hidden from the country, and he did not.The second: The hypocrites did not believe that God sent the Messenger to them, so they did not intend them in their hypocrisy, the deception of God, so that he did not On his appearance, but it is necessary to be used, and it is from two voices: the first: that he is the highest mentioned his soul and wanted his Messenger on him on his habit in his time, he said: They sell you, but they sell God [Al -Fateh: 10] and he said in his opposite: Know that you sang from anything, for God has the fifth of God: the al -Anfal: 41] It is itself, so those who escaped when they deceived the Messenger, it was said that they deceived God Almighty.The second: to be said: the image of their condition with God, where they show faith and they are disbelieving, the image of those who deceive The Muslims are upon them and they have the forefathers of the disbelief, the form of the Sunnah of God with them, where they consequently, the command of God in them, and they will be rewarded for them.* * * The third question: it is in the existence of the supply of that deception and in which it is guided by: the first: that they thought that the Prophet ﷺ and the believers run them in the majestic The believers, if they appear to them faith, and if they caught his disagreement, they will be excluded from the deception this.The second: It is permissible for them to be intended to divide the Prophet ﷺ to them his secrets, and to divide the believers, and they will transfer them to their enemies from the infidels.The third: that they paid for themselves the rulings of the infidels, such as killing, because he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: “I was commanded to fight the people.” The lord: They were aspiring in the money of the singing, for it was said: God is exalted, and he was able to reveal to Muhammad ﷺ how they are their deceased, and they are not.Do you have?We said: It is an exalted person who is able to release Plice and his atoms, but he is the Almighty and their strength, either because he does what he does and governs what he wants, or he does not want, or he does not want it, or he does not want it, If it was said: Do you have a deception to one of the correct faces?We said: The owner of the “scout” said: His face is to say: I mean it, so I did it, but he was brought out in a committee, so I did; Because the adulterer is in its origin for the exaggeration, and the verb when it is in it in which its actor came to the most vulnerable and judged from it if he passed away and one of it is not obligatory for the sake And the reader of Abu Hayyah will support him, “They deceive God” and then he said: They deceive a Bayan to say, and it is permissible for it to be in kind as if he said: “And he said:” What do we benefit from?They were deceived.(P-58) The Funny Natural: A Bever Reader, Ibn Katheer and Abu Omar, and what they deceive “and the rest” are deceived.For the first memorial, and the argument of the remaining people is that the one is between two, so the one person will not be deceived by itself, then they are mentioned in his saying: Sufficient themselves: The first: that it is the highest that rewards them with that and punished them for it, so they will not be in the truth, and they are unlawful, except for themselves, from the good.The second: What the most interpreters mentioned, which is that, and that is returned to them in the world; Because God Almighty was pushing the harm of their trustees from the believers, and he shared it with them, and it is like his saying: The hypocrites are the one who deceives God, and it is the one who is deceived by God: [142] Rather, we are mocked by God, mocking them [Al -Baqarah: 14, 15] [Al -Nahl: 50] They are sure of a good and certainty.God and His Messenger [Al -Ma’idah: 33] Those who hurt God and His Messenger [Al -Ahdab: 57] and remained in the verse after that research.One of them: Reading “and what they are deceived” who is deceived and “they deceive” by opening the ya in the sense of seizing ”and they are deceived, and“ they are deceived ”to what he did.And the second: the soul is the same and its truth, and it is not specialized in the bodies of its saying, the Almighty: you know what is in my soul and I do not know what is in your soul [the master: 116] Thinking that the deception does not prepare them to others.And the third of it: that the feeling is the knowledge of something if it is obtained by sense, and the feelings of the human being are his obsessive, and the meaning is that the sake of the warning of that is like the righteous, for the sake of the soul, for the sake of the people, for the sake of the people, for the sake of the people, for the sake of the soul He does not feel.
