The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: The human being has a loss in which the first question is: the thousand: the thousand and the blame in the human being, it is possible to be for the sons, and to be for the sake of the people.If this is mentioned by those who are in it, the first: the first: that the head is intended for it, and it is like their saying: Those who believed in human being.And the second saying: What is meant by him is a certain person, Ibn Abbas said: He wants a group of polytheists like Walid ibn al -Mughira, and Al -Aya ibn Walil, and al -Suwaid.A fighter said: I came down in my father, a flame, and in a good news that he is a ignorant father, and it was narrated that these were saying: “Muhammad is in a loss, so he divided the matter of the matter.They are delusional.The second question: the loss of losing, as it was said: the infidels in the infidels, and the meanings of the decrease and the fear of the heads of money, then (P-83) in it is the interpretation of them The sword was the meaning of the loss of its own and its age, except for the working believer.The infidel was intended to be in the misguidance and disbelief, except for those who believed in these, so that it will be saved from that loss to the profit.The third question: Rather, he said: In a loss, and he did not say: The loss is in the loss.There is a great loss that only God knows, and his report is that the sin is great with the greatness The two guys are in the context of the servant in the right of his Lord, so there was no crime that was the sin in the end of the greatness, and if we carried it on the second, the meaning was that the one who was lost, In the way that in my creation, who is the ethnic of you, and the correct interpretation is the first.The following question: for a saying to say: His saying: in a loss that benefits the neutralization, with the types of loss.The answer is that the real loss is his deprivation from the servitude of his Lord, and the seeds are the deprivation of paradise, and the rituals in the fire, so the lineage is as long as the first is like that Its existence is useful, and then he said: I did not create gin and humanity except to worship [Al -Dhariyat: 56] that is, when this is the reason for the sake of the purposes, it was the way to the one.And he knew that God Almighty has a Qur’an with the readers of his revelation, which refers to the exalted in the Bayan as the one of the human being in a loss: one of them: his saying is: The loss, and it surrounded it from every side.And the second: the word ““ it is for affirmation.And the third: the ritual of the lam in the losing.We are the first: the first: in his saying Hope: Loss, that is, in the way of losing, and this is like his saying in the eating of the millions of orphans: they eaten in their stomachs with fire [Women: 10] when it was punished.The second indifference: that the human being does not break from a loss, because the loss is the pledge of the head of the money, and the head of his money is his age, and he is a pen that is removed from his life Every hour passes through a person: if it is a source of disobedience, then there is no doubt about the loss, and if you are busy with permissions, then the loss is also, because it is, because it is a time, because it is a time, because it is a time It is an effect, with the fact that he was able to work in it a work that has always been impact That is, because the paths of subjugation and fear of God are not endemic, because the paths of the majesty of God and his abundance are not endemic, and the more he is the knowledge of it, the more it is the knowledge of it.More, so he was glorified by the two of the obstacles, and I was complete, and left the top and the minimum of the minimum.Loss.And I know that this verse is like an alert that the origin of the human being is that it is in the loss and the disappointment, and its report is that the happiness of the human being in the love of the hereafter and the symptoms of the religion Supporting to the hereafter is hidden, and the reasons for the love of the world are unjust, and it is the fifth obsessive, the desire and the anger, for this reason has become more ethical, the creation is the one They were used in its request, so they were in the loss and the boys, so it was said: It is up to the surah (P-84), the fig: We have created the human being in the best of the righteousness, [Fig: 4, 5] So there is a sign that the appetite is from the fullness, and the end to the decrease, and here it indicates that the appetite is from the shortage and the end to the kinship, so the gum?We said: The masculine in the wall of the fig is the conditions of the body, and we are the same conditions, so do not contradict the two sayings.
