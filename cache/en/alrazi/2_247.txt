The researcher of the Quran, his exalted: And their Prophet said to them that God has sent you a king who said that the king would have for us and we have the right of the king from him and he did not say To you and increased it simply in the knowledge and the body, and God will bring the king of those who praise, and God is wide, know The first of what they took over is a woman of Taltout, and that because they asked their Prophet to ask God to appoint them a king, so he answered them, and he said that God has come to God.The owner of the “scout”: I was tired of a domain name, such as the Dawn and Dadd.And when he was described by the simplicity in the body, and it is obligatory if it was from the length, then it was done, and the origin of it is long A cross and agreed with an Arab as he agreed (P-147), a ritual core, and on this estimation, one of him is the captivity of the old man, to be the sake of God.I seek it to be the king of them, they appeared to be on his obedience, and the symptoms of his judgment, and they said: that the king will have for him and they will be happy for him On them, the interpreters said: This is the receptor that the prophecy was specialized with a certainty of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and it is a way to the one who is Moses and Harun, and the authority of the king He was a king of them, and they claimed that they are more right to the king than him, then they confirmed this suspicion with another similarity, and it is their saying: and it is not a good thing Fakr, and they were dispersed and he said, and he was a bag, and Al -Saddi said: He was a dowry, and he said others, he was a watering.If it was said: What is the difference between the words in his saying: (And we are more right) and in his saying: (And it was not given).We said: The first is for the state, and the second is to comply with the sentence on the sentence immediately, and the meaning is: How does he possess on us and the situation is that he does not deserve to be attached Fakr, and the king must have money that he will be in charge of, and then he has answered their likeness to his lords: the first: the first: His saying: God, to see him, are the one who is the one who has been blessed The meaning of the verse is that it is the same as the king and the command.And he knew that the people when they were associated with the Prophet of that Prophet, his brother of God was exalted that he made a king of the king of them in the authority of the ritual of the weapon; Because the permissibility of the lie to the Prophet, peace be upon them, requires lifting the trumles with their saying, and that is praise in Their prophets are proven and their messengers, and if you prove the sincerity of the expert, it is proven that God Almighty specialized in the King, and if you prove that, it was a king and the one who has been made.The second question: His saying: (He chose it), meaning that the king takes from it, clearly to him, and he chose it, and described it in the sense of the abuse, which is that he takes a good thing To himself, and Al -Zajaj said: It is taken from the row, and the origin is in which it was fulfilled by the vitality, so the Ta’a changed the lean to make it easier for the sake of the shed What is meant by what we mentioned is that it is the highest of the king and the command, and on this direction and described the exalted himself that he had seized the messengers and described them: That he is the Mustafa.* * * The third question: This verse is indicated by the saying of those who say: The imam The king of the kingdom, then God knows them that this is a fall, and the one who deserves this is the one who has the highest of God Almighty with that, and he is the one who says: Whoever is the one who creates [Al -Imran: 26].The second face: In the answer to this suspicion, its saying is up to the Almighty: and it increased it simply in the knowledge and the body, and this answer is determined that they stabbed it in the sake It is not one of the people of the king's house.The second: It is a poor, and God Almighty shows that it is the family of the king, and that he decided that he obtained for him and Safan: one of them: knowledge.The second: ability.These two descriptions are more suitable for the ownership of the king from the first two descriptions and his two sides of his face The second: that knowledge and ability are among the tasks that have the same as the soul of the human being, and the money and the prestige are separated from the same human being.The third: that knowledge and ability cannot be caused by human being, and the money and the prestige can be robbed of human.And the fourth: that knowledge of the matter of war, and the strong (P-148) is the hardship of the warring, the intended to be in the interest of the country of the country, and in the payment of the evil of the With the rich, wretched man if he does not have knowledge of the connection of reconciliation, and a destiny to pay the deaths, so you have proven what we mentioned that the attribution of the king is from the one to the one who is the one to the one who is the one to the one who is the one who is from The rich tissue.* * * Then here are the questions: the first question: our companions were in the question of the creation of the work by saying it: and it increased it simply in the knowledge and the generosity, and this is the same, and this is the same, and this is the same.Rather, she got the creation of God Almighty and finding him, and the dismissed said: This addition was, but it was because it is the highest that is the one who gives the mind, and the one who has the same is the same, The preacher Without causes.* * * The ritual in the beautiful body, and the best of the children of Israel and it was said: the intended power, and this saying when I am correct because the one who benefits from it is in the payment of the rituals.The third question: It is the highness of the basis in the science, on the basis of the body in the body, and this is from it the highest alert it that the virtue of the nose is the highest and the most loud Jesusian.The third face: In the answer to the suspicion, his saying is up to God: And God will give his king to whom he will be blessed and his reports is that the king is for God and the servants of God, so he will be blessed.Plug for one of him in his action, because if the money is disturbed in his king, there is no symptoms for anyone in his action.The Fast face: In the answer, his saying is up to God: And God is a wide knowledge and in which three sayings are: one of them: that it is the exicide of preference, gorgeous, mercy, and mercy, and the mercy, and the mercy, and mercy, And the appreciation: You have stabbed in a way of being a poor, and God is exalted and the mercy and mercy, so if the king is delegated to him, then if you know that the king does not He opens the door of livelihood and capacity in money.And the second saying: It is wide, in the sense of expansion, that is, it expands on the one who will be blessed from his blessings, and attach him to what he accepted on what we mentioned.And the third: It is wide in the sense of a capacity, and a perpetrator and its meaning come as such, as his saying: a satisfied life [Al -Haqaqa: 21] meaning: the one who is satisfied, and the one who is a nap With his saying: (knowledge) that he is up to him with his ability to enrich the jurist, a scholar of the amounts of what he needs in the mobilization of the king, and a person in the case of the one in the case of the one who is in the case of the king, So he chooses his knowledge of all the consequences, what is his reconciliation in his doctrine with the command of the king.
