The researcher of the Qur’an is glorified and exalted, that those who disbelieved and died while they are disbelievers.Know that in the verse: (P-151) the first question: that the appearance of his words is upset: Those who disbelieve and died while they are in general disbelief in the right of everyone who was like that To summarize him with some of those who were like that, and the father of a Muslim said: It is obligatory to carry him to those who offer their remembrance, and they are those who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones He mentioned the state of those who conceal, then mention the condition of those who repent from them, also mentioned the state of those who die of them without repentance, and also that it is up to the one who mentioned that you mentioned They are cursed, showed in this verse that they are fabricated also after the dead.The answer to it is that this is correct when the people who die from otherwise are a repentance that they would not be inside the first verse, but if they enter the first: They are their remembrance, so it is obligatory to carry the words on an outdated matter.The second question; When he was mentioned in the words that if he died on his disbelief, the endeavor becomes necessary to be a condition, and when the one was attached to the condition, the condition of the condition was not.We knew that the infidel if it repented before the death was not like that.The third question: If it is said: How can people curse him, and the people of his religion do not curse him?We said: The answer to him is from his faces: one of them: that the people of his religion curse him in the hereafter, because he said: “Then the day of the resurrection is atone for each other [Spider: 25].And the second: Qatada, and Al -Raba’i said: He wanted people all the believers, as if he did not accustom them to others, and he was judged that the believers are not.And the third: that every one curses the ignorance and the unjust; Because it is a determination in the minds, if it is in itself ignorant or unjust, and if he does not know, it is from himself as it is like that, it was the same, it was the one who is the one who is the same It is its soul; On the authority of Al -Saddi.And the one who is seen: that the fall of the curse is carried on the verge of the curse, and then that is prevented.* * * The following question: Abu Bakr al -Razi said: In the verse there is a sign of that the Muslims are cursed by those who died as a disbeliever, and that the disappearance of the abandonment of it is not from it.And the brightness of it; Because his saying: People all have required our command after him after his death, and this indicates that the infidel is that if he was not the disappearance For its meanings and the brightness of it, and that is the way for the praise and the loyalty of faith and the righteousness, because you die who was like that or his madness, it is not a matter He is the case with it.The fifth question: those who say that they are broken by this The verse said: The Almighty was suspended and his cursing is that he dies on his disbelief, so if he deserved that before the death, he did not correct that, so he did not know that Consisting that if his friend died of him, and so is faith, but he benefits the sake of the praise if his owner dies on him.(Answer) You said: He only gets it.The sixth question: those who say that the disbelievers are from the legal names, and what remained on the original position and they are the disgraceful, they were brought up with the saying of the Almighty: And he described the state of their accusation that they are disbelievers, and it is known that the infidels in the sense of the hardship and coverage, in which there is no state of death; Because covering is only in the right to understand.The following question: The verse indicates the discretion with confirmation; Because he is upset, he said: People are all together that he is devoted to those who said: What is meant by people is some of them.* * * (P-152) As for his words, he said: I have immortalized in it, in it, the first: The second question: the one who is working in (immortal) is the one who said from his saying (upon them) because there is the meaning of the stability of the curse, so it is a state of distraction and mim in the “of them” The money must be hidden.The third question: immortalized in it, meaning: in the curse, and it was said in the fire, except that it was included in a fool of its affliction and the rituals of it, as it is in the saying of it: [Al -Qadr: 1] And the first is the first to Wajoh: The first: that if the destiny is found for him, a male who is presented to him, then his individuality to him, is from his response to what was not mentioned.The second: that the carrier of this curse on the curse is much more than its pregnancy on the fire; Because the curse is the dimension of the reward with the act of punishment in the hereafter and its creation in the world, so the curse was in which the fire entered the fire and increased it, so it was the pregnancy of the word.The third: that his saying: immortalized in it is a news about the situation, and in the holding of the guerrilla on the curse, that is at the exile, and in his pregnancy on the fire, it is not in the case, but it is not in the case.Tawil; So that was the first, and he knew that it was the highest and described this torment with three matters.One of them: the immortality, which is the long stay with us, and the staying staying at the dismissed, on what the saying is presented in it in the interpretation of his saying: And his sin surrounded him, for those who are the people of the fire are in it.[Al -Baqarah: 81].And the second: the largest of diminishing, and it is meaning that the one who attains them from the torment of God is similar in all of them, all of which does not become less than the leaks of one, then it is said: this is said: this is said: this is said: this is said: this is said: this is said: this is said: this is said: It is forbidden for Wajh: The first: If he depicts the state of others in severity, such as punishment, that was like a reduction from him.The second: It is up to them, and the time you missed from the torment, and then that of this is interrupted, so that it will be reduced.The third: where they address it by saying: they are fascinated by it and do not speak, there is no doubt that it increases their clouds in that time.They answered it: that the recession in these few matters, so those who are used by the severe torment do not pay attention to this little destiny from the recession; They said: And when the verse indicated that this punishment is similar, it must be always; Because if they had seized it, that is relieved of them, if they were perceived, and that there is a great time in the world if it is a great time in the world if it is good He rejoices, is easy, and made for the slope of his insult, and whenever his insult was greater, what he cares about is the wind and the slightness.The third adjective: One of the attributes of that punishment: its saying: nor are they looking and attention is the abuse and the delay.It is postponed, but it will be present, connected to the likeness of it, as if it is the highest of our knowledge that the ruling of the house of torment and the reward with the disagreement of the judgment of the world, so that they are the rule of the world.Excellency, and in the last, there is no time to be at all, if they are careful, they will not be humiliated, and if they seek help, they will not be relieved and if they seek, they will not be tired, and they are said to them; They are afraid of it and do not speak [the believers: 108].Of the deduction, lightness and delay.
