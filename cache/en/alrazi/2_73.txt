The Quranic researcher, and his saying is the Almighty: We said they were raised by each other, and he has books: The first question: The narrator of Ibn Abbas is that the owner of the cow of the cow Until it found it, then it was slaughtered, except that this narration is on the dispute of the Qur’an, because the fulfillment is in his saying: So we say it to him, and to the one who will be done.That his saying: Harb him with some of it, he will say the Almighty saying: God commands you to sacrifice a cow.(P-115) the question: They are guided by a guilt, and he is either returning to the soul and then, the reminder of the interpretation of the person and the human being, or to the dead, which is the one who has said: You are The third question: It is permissible for God to be exalted, but it is the sacrifice of the cow; Because it is attached to its sacrifice, it is not a sacrifice that does not happen except with its sacrifice, and it is permissible for the situation to be in it and otherwise on the level and the closest is the first; Because if it was the same as its place, it would not have been obligatory, but rather the choice between it and between it, and here the two questions: The cow it is that God Almighty is able to revive him?.Answer: It is useful in it to be the pilgrimage, and it is about the trick.If he lives when he is hurting with a piece of the cow, the lipstick, the suspicion has not been in that it did not live with something that was transferred to him from the garden.Live with a verb, so they did it, so that the flags of the prophets are shown, but it is from God, not with his voices from worshipers, and it is also a lord of the kinship.The kinship.The second question: Is it a matter of sacrifice other than the cow?And they answered that the words are in others if they were commanded by it, such as the words in it, then they mentioned in it and a good, from which the closeness is close to the closeness, which was the habit of this, and this is a neighbor, and this was a neighbor, and this is a neighbor, and this is a neighbor.They have the greatest of the two relatives, and it is more rewarded in order The cow.The following question: They disagreed that some of the one who crushed the murderer with what is it?And the closest is that they were good in the cowbags because they were commanded to strike the dead with some cows, and any of the cowbar, so they hit the murder Two of his saying: Harb it with each other and come with the affairs of it, indicating the exit from the task on what is proven in what is stable in it.Fetaling.And they differed in the bit of the dead, and it was said.It was said: The bone that follows the hurricane, which is the origin of the ears, and it was said: The place is between the two shoulders, and there is no doubt that the Qur’an does not indicate it, then if it is a narration of the news of the sake About him.The fifth question: In the words, it is deleted and appreciated, so we said it with it with some of it, and they struck him with some of them, and he is alive, except that he said that he said: God revives the dead, and upon him is the same as the Almighty: Harm with the stones of the stone, and it exploded [the cow: 60], that is, he was stripped of it, and it was separated.And his hands are blooded, and he killed me, so and so, so that his cousins, then he fell dead; They were killed.* * * As for His Exalted Him: Likewise, God revives the dead, and he has two questions: the first question: in this verse and Jahan: that it is a sign of the same.The second: that it is in the validity of the return, then the pilgrims are on the partners or otherwise?In it, Jahan: The first: The deaf said: It is on the partners because if he appears to them with the frequency that this life was on this face, they knew the right of the return With frequency, it is a preacher for them to think.The judge said: This is the closest because it is presented from it the highest remembrance of the matter (P-116) with the stirring and that it was the cause of the life of that dead, then he said: So, he will revive God, and God will live.What is meant by that dead, when he was collected in the saying, as if he said: This indicates that the return is like the appetite in its ability.The second: Al -Qafal said: The appearance of the words indicates that God Almighty said to the children of Israel: The life of God is the Almighty for the dead of the dead.Because, even if they were believers in that, they did not believe in it except from the way of the recipient, and they did not witness anything from it, so if they witnessed it, they will reassure them, and they will be reassured.The one who does not give up the inferred, and Abraham said to him, peace be upon him: The Lord of I, how to live the dead [Al -Baqarah: 260] to his saying: to reassure me: The sons of the families of the dead, then he said to them: Likewise, God revives the dead, that is, as he who lives in the world, he will live in the hereafter from otherwise to need to find that And a family.The second question: One of the people who inferred with the words of the Almighty: Also, God will revive the dead that the murdered is dead and he is weak because he is the highest of the Almighty The dead, so it is not necessary to be dead.As for his saying: He will see his verses, he says: If this was one verse, then it was called the verses?.The answer is that it indicates the existence of the foundations that are capable Moses, peace be upon him, and on the basis of the scene of those who were not killer.And on the help of that accusation against those who have been killed, if it is one verse, but it is what was indicated by these many signs, not Many.As for his words, the Exalted: Perhaps you are reasonable, and he will be in his life: the first: that the word “may” may come to its interpretation in the saying of the Almighty: The second: that the people were minds before the presentation of these verses on them, and if the mind had a reason, it is forbidden to say: I have been presented to you, the verse of the sake of God It is possible to conduct the verse on its appearance, but it is necessary to be interpreted, which is that what is meant is that you may work on the judgment of your minds The life of the soul is all for the eaten, so that they do not deny the resurrection, this is the last of the words in the interpretation of the verse.He knew that many of the advanced are mentioned that one of the rulings of this verse is that the killer is inherited or not?They said: No; Because it was narrated from Abu Ubaidah al -Sulamani that the man who was dead in this occurrence was deprived of the inheritance for the sake of his killer.The judge said: It is not permissible to make this matter one of the rulings of this verse because it is not in the apparent that the killer was a heir to his deadness or not?And it is possible to be a heir to him, so is the inheritance of the inheritance or not?It is not obligatory if it is narrated from Abu Ubaidah that the killer is forbidden, so that the inheritance was killed by him, that this is considered in the sentence of the rulings of the Qur’an if it is not a sign of it, and there is no one who does not.It is proven that their law is our legacy, and that they are not obligated to do so, so this is an introduction of these words in the rulings of the Qur’an.And know that the judge said, and with that, let us remember this question, so we say: On his authority, he does not inherit whether the killing was not a baptized, or he was sinned, or he was eligible, as he was a farewell if he kills the prostitute, and when Abu Hanifa, he did not And the mistake is that the return if (P-117) killed the prostitute, then he inherits him, and so the killer if he is a boy or a madman who inherits him, neither from his religion nor from the path of his mothers, is the one who says: Abbas and Said bin Al -Masib, and Uthaman Al -Batti said: The murderer of the mistake is inherited and the murderer of the baptism does not inherit, and Malik said: He does not inherit it from his religion and he is inherited from him Al -Hasan, Mujahid, Al -Zahri, and Al -Awazi, and the Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, took the place of the famous, abhorrent news that he ﷺ said: The recipient of this news is valid, even if we have a specialization of the general book with the news of the one, And the words are mentioned in the origins of jurisprudence, then there is a minute, which is that the specialization of specialization to the year benefits the types of weakness.So, then the reasons for weakness are in it, because it is a single news that obliges the weak, and it is on the path of the book, the reason for another, and it is the same If we had allocated the general book with it, we would have lost the weak very much.But if this news is not devoted to some of the reasons for the weakness of the weak, then it is not possible for it to be the same.And Abu Bakr Al -Razi took over that if he kills the prostitute, then he does not become a mihrab from the inheritance that we do not know that he is a disagreement that those who have the righteousness have to be.He is forbidden from the inheritance, and know that the Shafi’i is forbidden by this image, and God knows.
