The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: the example of those who spend their money in the path of God, like a love that seven Sanabel woven in every seventh of a hundred, a hundred And God is full.Know that he was given it when he mentioned the origins of the knowledge of the principle, the restoration, and from the evidence of their authenticity, what he wanted to follow that with the two parts of the ritual.The first ruling: in the two crocodiles that are considered to spend the money, and in the verse of the questions: the first question: in the infection of the arrogance, the first: the first: the judge - the judge - the mercy of God The most beautiful in his saying: Whoever lends to God a good loan, and he will be doubled for him, many weak weakness He mentioned among the two verses the evidence of its ability to be with life and death from where, if not for that, he did not improve the cost of spending; Because if it were not for the punishment of the punished, the punished, if the spending was in the man of obedience in vain, as if he was up to those who wanted to spend: I have known you I have to be with life and estimation, and you have taught me my ability to reward and reward, so let your knowledge of these conditions call for the spending of money, for it is the reward of the little Many are for example, which is that the one who seized a seven -sink in every seed of a hundred love, so the seventh of the seven.The second face in the Bayan al -Naqam: What was mentioned by the deaf, which is that it is the highest of this example, after he was brought up to all with what is required to believe the Prophet in the ritual in the way His victory and his project.And the third face: when the Almighty indicated that he is the guardian of the believers, and that the disbelievers are the first of them.Tago.The second question: In the verse, there is an estimated: the same as the charity of those who spend their money as a love.It was said: The example of those who spend their money as a parable of a love.The third question: meaning they spend their money in the path of God, meaning in his debt, it was said: He wanted to spend in the jihad in particular, and it was said: all the gates of the righteous And the negligence of spending in migration with the Messenger of God ﷺ, and from spending in jihad on himself and others, and from the money of money to charity, and from their spending in the reconciliation; Because all of that is a number in the way that is the religion of God and his way; Because all of that is a “spending in the path of God”.If it was said: Did you see a seed in it in a hundred love until the example is struck by?.We said: The answer to it is from his faces: The first: that the one who is intended from the verse is that if a person knows that he is asking for Ziadah and the profit that it is (P-40) if the seed of a single love He has the seventh of a love that he would have left for that, not to shorten it in it, so that he will be forgiven for those who ask for the reward in the hereafter with God, if God does not know that he does not know He has one tenth, hundred and seven, and if this meaning is reasonable, whether it is found in the world, a bond of this row, or if it was not found, and this is not found, and this is the meaning, The saying of the lock - may God have mercy on him - is good.The second answer is that it is a delegation of that in the bond of the gossip, and this answer is in the end of the knee.The following question: Abu Umar, Hamza and Al -Kisa’i were tweeting the tattoo in the cinema in his saying: The seven of Sanabul woke up because they are the one who is not a person who is not.The original.* * * Then he said: God is doubled for someone who will be blessed and in which there is a boundary of that double, and there is no one who is honored by God with this double, but it is that it is necessary It is expected to all the righteous, and it is permissible for each other to be worked out from where his spending is insert With more acceptance and reward.* * * Then he said: And God is wide, that is: the extent of the ability to be rewarded for the good and the preference for them, with the amounts of the agreements, and how the matter is due to it, and it is not possible for you to do so.The work of the worker is lost with God Almighty.
