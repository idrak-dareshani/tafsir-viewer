The researcher of the Quran, the transcendent: and what they did not take from them, except that they believe in God, the Head of Head, who has the possession of the heavens and the earth, and God is for everything, and what is the meaning of the meaning of them Like his saying: “If only they are disadvantaged, they will not be aware of them.Except that they believe that the torment was based on faith in the future, and if they disbelieved in the future, they were not tormented on what went on, as if it was said: Their faith, and Abu Hayyah read: The first: the dear, which is the Qadir who is not overwhelmed, and the one who is not paid, and in the sentence, it is a sign of the complete ability.And the second: Al -Hamid, who deserves praise and praise for the Sunnah of his faithful worshipers, even if some of the things are not praised by his tongue, so we will breathe The truth is it, as he said: And from something, it is not praised by his praise [Al -Israa: 44], and that is a sign of knowledge because whoever is not a scholar of the consequences of the things is not that he can do so that he can not be done.Al -Jaimid indicates complete knowledge from this face.And the third of it: the king of the heavens and the earth, which is its money and the values ​​of them, and if it is for us, and it is a sign of the full king, but it delayed this characteristic of the first of the first.He only has the same time when he obtained the fullness and knowledge, so you have proven that those who were described by these attributes were the one who deserves to be faithful to him, and he did not.How is the judgment of these disbelievers ignorant of being like this faith as a sin.And he knew that he was highly said by saying: (Al -Azziz) that if he wanted to prevent those of these kebabs from the torment of those who are believers, and to whom they have notified, and he will be blessed with them, and he will be blessed with them, (Al -Hamid) that the one who has the one who has the rituals of the verbs of the verbs, then it is, and if it is a pleasure, but it is what he was treated, for it is the Almighty, and the reward is the reward of the first This is the disbelief to them, but it is not the Almighty, because it did not do it only on the behavior of the will or the reconciliation of the righteousness, and it is the same, so it is for the sake of the righteousness.And God is a witness, and it is a great promise to those who are obedient, and a severe return for the criminals.
