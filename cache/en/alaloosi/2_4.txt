The researcher, who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and the hereafter they are certain of the kindness of the first connection, separated, and the one who is a separation, and the one who is a separation, and the one, And the son of Masoud, may God be pleased with them, that they are the believers of the people of the book, and where the one who is repeated from kindness is that faith in each of the two of the people is the best With them, because the faith of others is what was revealed before it is on the way of the bulls and the followers of faith in the Qur’an, not in the place of praise, and the meaning The book is in the middle of that, and this is what they came before them, and it was said: The abuse by adopting that the first faith in the mind, and this is what is wrong, and that is, and that is what, and that is, They know their children, and those are on the guidance of the first one, because their faith in the presence of the Rabian guidance, and those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the The second is to win them as they were waiting for it, or that those are from where the group was in them, and they did not participate, and they did not involve, and they did not, and they did not, and they did not With generalization and specialness, the same in its words, the Almighty: the angels, the spirit, and the specialization are revealed here after the generalization of the signal to the best of them, from the time of them.Two times, and there may be in the preference that is not in the virtuous, and in that the people of the book will be absent in the entry in Islam, and some of them said: The first of them is the first of the people Conducting the names and adjectives by administering the seduction of the concepts, and it is wow, and the loyalty, and then by administering the punishment of the resignation in the cases, and the collection that benefits from the waw of the wow is here The concept is one of the two sympathetic, and the faith with the first of them is a blatant and mental, and with the seconds of detail and transmitted, and the return of the communication to the one The two tribes, and the two ways, and the righteous may be overlooked, and the connector is not separated, so what is necessary for the chapter in the chapter in the man And his informing it, the consequence and the consequences of it, and the abuse between the emotions by adopting that what is meant by the one who is known to him is the one who believes in the Arabs, who is the one who does not Whoever believes in him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, is one of the people of the book, and some of the investigators have suggested that these are the first ones, and they are the first, With the two years, it is partized between the believers as a whole, so there is no face to be specialized in my believer, the people of the book, and the individuals are the remembrance that the faith is not.The books that were revealed before the words of the Almighty said: “Say: We believe in God, and what was revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, and it was not necessary for the sake of faith, And that the people of the book were not believers in all of what was revealed before, because the Jews did not believe in the Gospel It is safe from the people of the book, so the specialization of those but them is governing, and made the words before the special kindness of the year.And I answer, either, for the first, that the one who is repeated from the righteousness is faithful, not in the place of praise, and to which he indicates what came that they are paid in their reward, and the one in the ritual For Muslims to say a motivation, and there is no longer faith and believer, so do not want to be broken, and secondly, because the faith of the people of the book is all, but it is the same.The Jews are their faith in the Qur’an, the mourning, and the Christians, their faith in the Gospel as well, and it is sufficient for this in the murwan of the narration, so they witnessed the descendants of the ritual.I could find it, and the concept of the concept is the confirmation of the judgment of each one if he is a ladder and does not return it, and it is not necessary that the Jews who have believed in us.They are upon him and peace be upon him, and they did not believe before that with the teeth, otherwise they would be victorious because there are the prophets of Jesus, as there are the prophets of the Messenger of God, the Messenger of God, the Messenger of God He was replied in it: God came from the phase of Sana, and he appeared in the afternoon.May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, because we say: They believe in the convergence, and interpreted what was indicated by the prophecy of the Christ, peace be upon him, so we will be blessed.And threw it with what he threw, his entourage, and they are the many, and some of the children said: It is one of the saints of God, the Almighty, who are the ones who are known to the rituals of the Few of those who are violated to the birds of Jews in the Sabbath and the hands, and they are confused about the eaters of the bird, the antelopes, the thickness, and the righteousness, and this faith, even if it is not a fool in the survivor, It reduces evil with the lineage to the infidelity with the mortality and its denial of the kidneys with the infidels with Jesus, peace be upon him, and they may be praised by the look of the faith, and they are in the first place.Other, as if this is satisfied with them with the reward, and they did not have a food for a divorced Siyouf, and he said that they were praised after their faith in the faith Their predecessors who were on the covenant of Moses, peace be upon him, are believers in it with a correct faith on its face, as they have given themselves to what they have made of their fathers on the authority Many of the verses, not something, as there is no meaning for their coming (P-121) two of the time, and the difference between the two papers is clear, then the copy of which is the one who claimed it.Al -Shahrisani And others that the Gospel did not show judgments, nor is it permissible and forbidden, but it is symbols, ideals and preaching, and the judgment is referred to the supplier, and I have said: Al -Tawarah, but I came to complete it, and this is the difference of what is required by the distress, and it will come if God wills, may He be fulfilled, and he will be fulfilled.It is harmful, because it is a male in the first, and in the second commitment, and as a powerful, we do not receive that that kindness does not come to the place, so the wealth of the special kindness of the year is not over the year On the virginity of understanding, let what passed, and take what is solution, and after this all this is that the symptoms are male and the answer is a female, but the novel is called to that With its people, and according to every knowledgeable knowledge, the knowledge may help him as it was said, based on the return that the return of the connection and his support with the faith of the faith Between all the believers, and the disguise of faith in what has been revealed to you on the faith of what was revealed before you, you claim that those who have the goodness of them are intended, Where they were demanding faith in the Qur’an in particular, he said: And believe in what I descended as a sincere of what you have believed in the books, in the past, in the past The one who is replaced by the people of the book, the people of Al -Tawara and Al -Najil, and his pregnancy on the people of the Gospels in particular, and four of them believed in one of them and thirty and thirty, who came with Jaafar From the Levant, it is not restored by a narration or a knowledge of it, as it is not hidden, and the removal of communication and the etihad, and it is not obligatory to be from the highest disagreement of those who claimed it, then it is, if it comes to the authority of any of them.And the solution, and the removal of the divine books has passed through the progress what he brings to his acquaintances, and it was mentioned that the meaning of the Qur’an is that Jabriel heard the words of God So he descended it, or appeared in the wiping as a book, so the king kept it, and some of the earlier went to that it is the simplicity of whom we have, and he said: Judgment: The souls of the Prophet, peace be upon them, are ahead of them, so he is strengthened by contact with the highest fullness, and it is engraved in it from the pictures that takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the one who takes to the good The subscriber, so he sees as the viewer, which is the revelation, and perhaps they are heard, and he hears the words of systems, and it is likened that we go to the books from this, and when this is that this is the case The Qadisiyah, and the human aspects, except that the matter of prophecy is behind, and where is the richness of the hand of the one.And doing the two buildings for the one who is the one who is al -Nakha’i, and Abu Hayyah, and Zaid ibn Qutbib al -Ma’nin for the reaction, and the anomalous readings of you: The lam, and directed that he dwells Lam (descending), then He was omitted (to) and transferred its brokenness to the lam, so the groan was upset, and he was tickled, and the subject of the actor was said: God, and it was said: Jabril, peace be upon him, and in the peace of the peace To provide “from what we have given them,” he came out from the guarantor of the one who spoke to the guarantee of the absence, and if it was running over the first, he came: what we have come to you, and what happened to us, and what happened to us, (What) The first is a past action, with the fact that what is meant by all is to fulfill the righteousness, and the race has from the arrangement of guidance and the full gossip upon him, and the one who is not in it.Before, and to perform (they believe), which is reported from the recipient, and the whole of the time was not descended from two things: the first is that it is not the same It is found, as it is before the launch of the part for all, and the second is similar to that of all the descendants with something that came down in the achievement of the fall, because it is some of it.So the gambling of its group becomes similar to the removal of that thing that has descended, so the last form of its removal is naughty to remove the group, this is what he achieved Their remembrance of Al -Khanasar, in which there is a prolonged tick, and it is more important that the expression in the past is here for the problems for the fact that it is not achieved in And it is all that of all of that, that what is meant by the truth of the past, and it is indicated by faith in the future in the text I am completely, and that is why he is confined to him, there is no face to him, as there is no suspicion that the believer must believe in what (P-122) has descended, and that all of the right is, and that is the right of the right And his awareness, and the scholars have mentioned that faith is a wardrobe with the books that are divorced, and the custody of the eyes, and a separation of the Qur’an, the worshiper, for the sake The imposition of an eye that led to the embarrassment and the hardship, and the religion is easy, not hard, and this is what is not likened to it, until the calling is said: It is obligatory for the sufficiency.Where it is possible to remove the similarity, the commitment of those who suffer, and the guidance of the two guidances, and the jurists mentioned that it is necessary to be in every limit It is described by this adjective, and the tendency is called to the vinegar, and the imam is forbidden by its brotherhood from that, as it is forbidden by its brotherhood from the scholar with the rulings of the one who is the one who does not It is necessary for a person like that in every tribute, and it was said: It is sufficient for his presence in all the Islamic pamels, and perhaps this descending to the descent of the matter, and the religion of the matter, With this era.؎ I forgot a wealth and my family, I have been carried by my brother, who is my brother on the beginning and to God, the Almighty, and to him the mill (And the hereafter) The last is an active name from the last of the three in the sense of delay, even if it is not used, as the other with the opening of the khua is the name of the preference from it, and it is a row in the original, as is the same as the original, and it is in the original in the original.The hereafter, and then prevailed like a religion, and the most important description may be described by the dominant name, so it is not said: a feet is an illusion, for the obligatory, the abuse is in the The dignity is that it is used by those who do not take it in the first place, so they understand, and the house may be added to it as the saying of the Almighty: the last of the last is the house of the life of the last As his saying, his praise and the Almighty: He has praise in the first and the hereafter, and the meaning is here the last house or the last of the emergence, and the gathering on the silence of the mother of the endowment, It will be after the cut, and a brush is deleted, and the movement is transferred to the mother, (and the belief) is achieved for the affliction as its silence and its clarity.It is under it, and it is the one who is in the sense of the one who is in it, and al -Jawhari said: The kinship is the knowledge and the demise of the suspicion, it is said from it: it is based on the fraction of it.In this sense, and the one gone and a group that is what is from the view and the receptor, so it is not described by al -Bidi, and the knowledge of God is not exalted.And the imam gave the Nassfi and some of the imams that it is the knowledge that does not bear the contradiction, and the rest of the truth is the right of it and the exalted to it for the sake of the elderly With the authority after his friend was a complaint in it, whether it was a warning or a recipient, and the desire was mentioned that the righteous is from the characteristic of the knowledge, and it is the same, and it is the same.It is said: the knowledge of a luminous, and it is not said: the knowledge of a tendency, and it is the constraint of the soul with the steadfastness of the judgment, and in (life), and the heart of it is inclined, that the one is the one who is blessed The doubt is called everything that has no doubt, whether it has a look, a sense, or a misfortune, or a frequency, or a sign, and this is not the same The jurisprudence and the Sufis, and many of the scholars, which is not seen in it, and the doubt, but rather to its victory over the heart until it is said: So, so weakened the mold With the provisions of the sustenance, everything that prevailed over the heart and took over it, so it is a luminous, and this recession is a phenomenon.Because he is from the one who was certain, and Al -Numayri read with a hook that was dominated by the wow, and it was common for them that if the waw, if it is included in a guarantee, is unavailable as it was separated in the Arab It was said in the faces of a whole face, so perhaps the replacement is here for its way to the guarantee, so its judgment was given, and the neighbor was taken, and the neighbor is taken.With the descendants and faith in the hereafter, he did not say: And by the hereafter they are They believe, payment of the reasons for the repetition or for the abundance of the attachment of the other attachments, and what was prepared in the reward, (P-123), punishment, and detailing the types of abuse, And the creation of their companions on the disagreement of the worldly creation, with the proof of the Jasbian Reader, how was it to what is from what is strange from the faith in the book of the book, From the people, and it is free from its conjunction with what we have to be present and the Evangelism, so it is not in the first on what is in the explanation of the sequence of the remembrance of the body, but it is mentioned in the book And the people, and the remembrance of the Gospel, is the spiritual hostility, so it is appropriate for this that is the most important thing that is the most important of the many, the most important of the many, and the most important of it, The bed was harmed by the fire with certainty, and it is a show of the gathering of praise and the calamity of the purpose of praise, and the boundaries of the boundaries of the indication that their arrest is short of the right of the right To the disagreement of its truth, which is the benefit of the Juda, for example, where they said: He will not enter paradise except for those who were obedient and the fire will not touch us except for the numbers of them and the grace of them.With the human being, and the souls, as this is not from the hereafter in anything, and in the construction (they are dependent) on (they), indicating that the compatriots of their opposites in the hereafter, and the ignorance of the ignorance of the one who is ignorant, and the ignorance of the Levantine in shadow and no.
