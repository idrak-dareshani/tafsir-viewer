The Quranic researcher, they bought them for themselves to atone for what God has descended, that is, they baawah, for the same is the eight hlopic, and the disbelief in the house of the whim Rather, it is sold, and it is on the basis, that is, they chose the disbelievers on faith, and they spent themselves in it, and it was said: It is with the meaning of the famous, because the cost of it is the one who is afraid of the one who is afraid of the one who is afraid if he is afraid With declines, he thinks that it is saved, as if he had been his soul with it, so the gestures of the Jews when they were inconsistent with when they came to him that he would be saved from them And they concluded it, and God has forgotten them, and it was assumed that it is an exemplary that they claimed that they thought that with his saying, the Almighty: So when he came to them, then they will be disbelieved.How do they think their grapes are what they have done, and the will of the worldly punishment is like the righteousness of the righteousness, and it is not correct, because it is not the same as the soul, and the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that it is Their state of their condition is in the way of the crucifixion, and the fear while they are coming and they are prejudiced, and the claim of the truth is in it, so it is not incompatible with their belief in the fact that the one who does not have to do so Since God descended the truthful book, and in the way of coming to the removal of the poet that he is from the high world with the chain of transmission to him, the exalted, and the exalted Faith for him, and it was said: It is possible for him to be intended for him and the Gospel, and that all of them are wanted, and the infidelity of each other is disbelieving in both From the Arabs or not?The mutation went to the fact that it is not a place for it, and that it is with the misery of one thing as a sacrifice, and the (P-322) gone is gone until it has a place, and the absence The most lighter to the first is that it is distinguished, and the sentence after it is in the position of a stab.They are atoned, it is the one who is devoted to vilification, and expressing the formula of harming the benefit of the one who is the one who is involved in the disbelief, for it is the obligatory for the torment of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones The special be deleted, and they bought a row for him, and the estimation: the misery of something, and they bought it, and that they disbelieve in the deletion of the deleted, or the news, or the news of the Al -Kasayi went to the position on the other, but he estimated after it, what was other They bought, and his Siphi went to the second on that it is a good act, and it is completely known, and the special is deleted, that is, something they bought, and this is the same, and this is the same, and this is the same.Mawasul, and he is one of the words of Al -Farisi, and his dear son of Attiyah to Sibuyeh, and he is an illusion, and the Mahdawi was transferred from Al -Kisa’i that (what) is a source, It was assumed that misery does not enter a specific name that is known to be added to the guerrilla, and you have this estimation that you do not make that effective, but it is a verb, but it is a verb, but rather it is a verb, but rather it is the same Destroyed, and the distinction is deleted to understand the meaning, and the stine: the misery of their perseverance, so that the symptoms are not necessary, the blessings of God (what is in it) The source is not returned to it, because it is a letter when it is not afraid, so they understand, it is necessary that God be revealed in the origin of the darkness and the corruption: The wound is a spoiler, Al -Asma’i said, and it was said: The origin of the student is, and its types are different.With the cursing of the shrine, he is asked for what is not for them.(Let them be atoned) So he will benefit that their disbelief was for the deceased of stubbornness that is the result of the envy, not for the ignorant, and it is the most informed of the defam It is the cause (they bought) and responded that the chapter is obligated to the foreigner, and it is the one who is specialized in the vilification.It is hidden that he is a foreigner with the action to the action that was described by the decent of the actor, and the saying that the meaning is that they have not sold it to them, and it is not the same Suffice them, which is the infidelity, is a ruling, yes, it may be said: The chapter is obligated to a foreigner, if the special is the one who has told it, then it is a good.A deleted, and it is the choice, so no, because the sentence is then an answer to the question about the act of a bad, so the chapter will be between the one who is the one who is the same, and it is not the same In it, and made it a cause (to be bought), a deleted one of the chapters, and among them is one of his Arabs immediately and a verb, divorced to be able, that is, the abundance of it, and that is, Either it is effective for the sake of the prostitutes, that is, the good for the sake of the download of God, or on the projection of the rejectionist who is attached It is a subject that is depicted on the fact that it is a detention of what is in his saying: What God has descended is very far, and perhaps he is close to what was said: It is in the place The person is asking what he does not have, he is transgressing for himself, and the first thing is, and the first act is here, here I mean, praise be to him, peace and blessings be upon him.And the significance is that the envy is defamed in itself, as it was the matter, as it was not hidden, and Ibn Katheer read, Abu Omar, and Jacob (Yanzal) He wanted the revelation, and from the end of the end, a liquid The survival is that you are increased by the fear of the fear, on the one who creates his worshipers, that is, whoever chooses him for a sane And he greeted, because they envied him when he was not from them, and he was from the Arabs, and from the son of his hearing, and he was not from his son a prophet who has been upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, (p-323) For the honor, (and who) is either a connection, or a description.So they were angry with anger, a separation of what they were presented, that is, they returned, wrapped in anger, who is angry with anger, who deserved it, It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, that the first anger of the servants of the hurry, and the second for their disbelief in it ﷺ, and said: The first: the first: the first: The disbelief of the Qur’an, and it was said: They are the disbelievers of Jesus and Muhammad, who are praying and peace, or their saying: Azir Ibn Allah, and God will be blessed, And their disbelief in the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, is not hidden, and it is not hidden that the fulfillment of kindness requires their erasure to the right of the anger, for the sake of the anger, for the sake Azir, the son of God, is an example other than what is mentioned in the past, and it is required that he say that he said: with anger at the anger of the anger, and there is no anger, and there is no angry, and there is no anger, and there is no So that the situation is tightened by them, as he said: “If it was a single spear, it was not a long time, but it is a spear, the second, the third, and the one who is the one who is good They disbelieved and envied what they mentioned, etc., and nothing.ولِلْكافِرِينَ عَذابٌ مُهِينٌ اللّامُ في الكافِرِينَ لِلْعَهْدِ, والإظْهارُ في مَوْضِعِ الإضْمارِ لِلْإيذانِ بِعِلِّيَّةِ كُفْرِهِمْ لِما حاقَ بِهِمْ: ويُحْتَمَلُ أنْ تَكُونَ For the general, the entered in it in which it is in the style of what has passed, and the humiliating humiliation, and the origin of it is humiliating, and it is high, and its chain of transmission to the torment is a metaphor, from the chain For the piety and the choice that the news is understood by the lineage to it, then other than the infidels, if it is tormented, then it is tormented for the time, and it is not for the sake The torment of others has not described it in the Qur’an, so do not hold the Kharijites that he specialized the torment of the disbelievers, so the immorality is a disbeliever, because it is a disbeliever, because it is a disbeliever, for the sake of the one, for the sake of it
