The researcher of the Qur’an is copying from a verse, or we forget it, we have come down when the participants or the Jews said: Do you not see to Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.He commands them with his disagreement, and the day says a saying, and he returns from it tomorrow, this Qur’an is only as the words of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, he says from his words Some of it is one, and the copying in the language is the removal of the image, or what is in its ruling about the thing, and the similarities of that other than that, whether

them, and it is first of the consent, and therefore he desires in it the desire, so from the first one, the one who has the ritual, and the second, is the one who is the one who is the one who is the

and raised the lineage to us, and he came out with the rest of the worship of the absence With it, and he concluded the definition with the rulings, as you do not worship in the news himself, and its disappointment, when it is drained from the hearts, that you do not stay in the memorization, and this is the same, so it is the same, so it is the same.Some of what he memorized, and he did not find

it: (If the son of Adam and the hands of the money had no money, and I will not be a third of the money The son of Ibn Adam except the dust) and we were reading a wall that we likened to one of the precedents, so I forgot it, so that I kept it from it (O you who did not.You will do, and you will write a martyr in your neck, and you will ask about it on the day of resurrection), and will that be for the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, not?There is a disagreement, and those who are grateful to the first are inferred by the Almighty saying: We will read you, so do not

of them were transcribed by removing the judgment, whether the word is proven, or not, and the women with the removal of the word The previous ruling, and the second to go to the release, is not to a substitute, and it is mentioned on both of the two guys that the copying of this meaning is a violation of the language, and the authority, and the authority, About the hearts, and the bearing on the metaphor with the excuse of the truth, it is arbitrarily, and perhaps what is attached to it for the validity of these two interpretations from the one who is from the narrators It proves, (and) is a firm condition (let us be transcribed), affiliated with it on the verbal, and does not contradict it from its factors (P-352) and the work of the one who is a factor, and the factor of the So the condition included a worker, and by her crying a work is a work, and it is appreciated for itself assertive, otherwise it is necessary to refuse the workers on the work of one, and the one who does not do so, and it is not possible After it, as it is in it to enter into the innerous matters, and the people of the bodies agreed on the permissibility of the copy and its fall, and it was

verse that is not something like an involvement of the cousin (what) And an effective verse, that is, any copying, we are copying a verse, but this involvement is more and forbidden, as it is not hidden, and the informed guarantee is based on a verse on the same Because the forgotten is not the forgotten, and it is specialized in the remembrance of the majority of the majority, otherwise the judgment is not unique to it.From the seventh (we are transcribed) as a matter of actions, and the prodigy as Abu Ali said: For the grandfather on a row, we have been rejected, that is, it is not the meaning of it.Wind up, and we will find it, so that we only copy it, so the two readings agree in the meaning, and if they disagree in the memorial, and the son of the son of the gossip of the The verb is then prepared to the users, and the appreciation is what we are copying from the verse, that is, what we praise you to copy, as if it is what we have abused it, God bless it.Ali and peace be upon him with that copying, so that pornography called a dirt, and some of them made the transcription of the matter with the transcription, and the command is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is Or Jabriel, peace be upon him, and the introduction to be from the copying of the book, that is, what we write and we will come from The fragmented, or what we are delayed in and left, so we do not descend it, and the two coming after the two after it is returned to what he is a guarantee of the one who forgets it, the one who forgets it from the one who is the one The name of

of the copyist, where the time of that is the time of the bond of the woven, so the one who comes to the time of the It is a transcription of the transcription, the meaning of the verse is that he raised the woven by removing the copyist and delaying the copies by removing the woven from the time Reconciliation in his time, and read the laughter, and Abu Al -Rajaa (we forget it) on the form of the information of the word, with the other than the humanity, and the one who said: His humanity, may God Almighty, and his forgotten, forget about the meaning, that is, we forget one of them, and read the good, and Ibn Yamar (forget it) with the opening of the tattoo of the people, A storyteller, and a difference as well, except that they were stubborn, and Abu Hayyah like that, except that he included the Tax on that it is from the women, and he read a temple like him, and he did not.In the first place of the noun and the fraction of the cinema, it is not a prodigy, and with the rhetoric
