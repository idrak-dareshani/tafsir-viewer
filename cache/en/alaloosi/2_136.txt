The researcher, the Qur’an, believe in God, a speech for the believers, not for the disbelievers, as it was said, because it is in the cost and the cost, and the two people of the mourning of the matter of the matter of the matter of the matter, His two sayings: Rather, the religion of Abraham is that the follower includes the belief and the work, and this is the two intentions of the belief, or the replacement of the insult to what is in it in it.The first, and it was said: Narfa, as if they asked how to follow?So they answered that, and first commanded the form of the individuals, and secondly in the form of the collection, indicating that it is sufficient in the answer to the saying of the Messenger ﷺ on the one hand of all the believers, there is no It must be from the saying of each one, because it is the condition of faith, or its parts, some investigators said, and the saying that it is the house of the two, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the first Fellow, does not deviate from anything, and faith is presented to God, because he is the first of the obligations, and because he submits his knowledge, it is correct.And what the Qur’an was revealed to us, and it is in the descent of the Nazouli propellants delayed from others, but it is in the faith of the faith that is presented to him, because it is the reason for it, because it is the reason Certifying him, and so he presented it.And what was revealed to Abraham, Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes means the newspapers, and it is, even if it was revealed to His Highness, peace and blessings be upon him, but he was not.With its conquest inside, under its rulings, it is valid (P-395), and we will go to them as well, as it was correct to worship us with the conquest of the Qur’an, and we will enter it.We take it to us, and the tribes are a whole that is analogy and pregnant, and they are the children The many branches, as if they were called for their many, and it was said: From the cakes, which is the embarrassment, and it was said: It is the heart of the ritual, and it was said: God ﷺ for the spread of their offspring, and then it was said to every son of Banat: a slave, and so it was said to him: a master Epidem, or not?And who was authenticated by me, who is the one who is narrated from Jaafar Al -Sadiq, may God be pleased with him, and to him the Imam Al -Sayouti went, and he wrote it in it, because there is no one from them.The prophecy is contradicted, and it is before the eloquence, and it is not a Muslim, because there are verbs that are not able to do it except for the bolders, and on the validity of the rituals of what is not possible It is the correct saying in the matter of the prophets, and how great is that of that verb, and there is no evidence in the Qur’an, and what is indicated in the Qur’an, and the verse has been known to us That is guided.Moses and Jesus did not die, that is, the mourning and the evangelization, and for the fact that the people of the book have increased, stimulated, and died.In them, and claim that they were descended like that, and the believers deny it, they are concerned with their affairs, so they separate them with the remembrance, and they have been clear, and the faith is clear.The previous connector, and because their matter is also the same as the lineage to Moses and Jesus that they are declared to them a truth, not by adopting the worship only, as well And the tribes, and the connection is not prepared for that in Jesus because of the violation of its project for the project of Moses, except in the Nazir, and that is the right to cross that it is to be done by To be the one who is intended from it, and for the indication of the giving in which the likeness of your assignment and the ablution, and this is what is said: I descended the evidence in the well O, and to you to say: What is meant by the one is the best of the supplies, the fence, and the man of the miracles that appeared in the hands of these two prophets, the two of the two of the two, Glorious download, and the ritual gathering for him, and the prophets are devoted to the remembrance of the words, because the words are with Jews and Christians.The prophets were not given, which are the books that have allocated from them, or what is included in that, and the miracles, and it is a blindness after the specialty, from the one who is from the one who is from Their Lord is commented (with my death) before it, and the guarantee of the Prophets in particular, and it was said: for Moussa and Jesus also, and it will be “what I have been” is a confusion of the first The two estimates are a definition, and it is permissible to be in the position of the situation from the deleted domesticated That is, as the people of the book separated, then they believed in one another and disbelieved with one, but we believe in them all, but it is considered that the separation is between them That is the extent of the separation in it between what it has, (and one), its origin is a limit in one sense and where it was signed in the context of the negation of the one and the level of the one, the one who is the one, and the one who is the one, and the one who is the same I want it here the group, and this is so that it is added to it (between), and the general community is beneficial, as is the case with some who are investigating, and it is contrary to what is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is The place in the general negation or the user with all in the evidence is original, with the disagreement of what is used to do the things with the entirety of all, for it is a matter Al -Alawiya said: (one) in the sense of the group, according to the place, because it is a name for someone who is correct to address in which he is mentioned, And the group, and it is involved to be the severity of it with (P-396) the word of each, or with the negation, the text of that is the father of Ali and others from the imams of the Arab He who is the first number in his saying is up to the Almighty: Say: God is one and not It is in the sense of the group on the side of his universe in the context of the negation of what was before, to many of the delusions, do not you see that it does not evaluate, and we do not separate from With the appreciation of the kindness of any messenger and a messenger, and you are as one of the women, it is not in the sense of a woman from them, and you are after the reflection, you know that you do not know On that some, but the violation is only in the arcade and its numbers, and perhaps the matter is easy in it, that the pretext of that of that is the righteousness of that Ali, it was mentioned in the equity that the denial occurred in the denial of the negation benefits the general public to the uninterrupted unintegratedness until the uniqueness is revealed in it.The ones are custodian, not as some of the fundamentalists think that its signs are with the way of the abandonment in the negation as its consequences in the evidence, and this is made of the number To enter between it here, and among the people who have been distinguished by (one) in the verse in a single sense, and its generality is a splendor, and the authenticity of the entry of it (between) He deleted his appearance between one of them and others, and in it from the significance of the achievement of separation between every individual of them, and among those who are not, there is no one who is not.We separate them from them, and there is no hide from what is in it, and the sentence is a state of the guarantor in (Aman), and we have Muslims, that is, they are subject to God, with the obedience, They are criticized for his command and forbidding him, and whoever made the bitter bitter to be offended by his remembrance of the prophets, he has been a distance, and the sentence is another condition, or a kind.
