This is that they are the most important of them, so a daughter of a princess has been endowed with them, so he reiterated it after the reconciliation, so she was satisfied with him between her father and who is his father, and she is from him and who is from him and who is from him and who is from him, so he is from him And he influenced him on her father, and he was angry and the age of the saying, so they did it other than them and feared that they will fall for them after the same thing In the health of that.Al-Bazi read in a narration: “Al-Mawdadah” as a gathering, so he used to be the (P-53) al-Asalah ”as the mortality, such as the rule of the vast, so the movement of the threat is transferred to the kinship, so the movement of the threat is transferred to Al-Waw, It was then omitted, then that waw, and begun to be an effective name from the "Ad" and the origin of the shelter, so that one of the wanders was omitted, so the wandering of the waters A saying became a saying.And it was read: “Al -Wuddah” is to the first waw, and to facilitate the ham.And in the group of Bayan and the Handhore, it was narrated from Abu Jaafar and Abu Abdullah and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them The mercy and kinship, and on the authority of Abu Jaafar, the kinship of the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and he is intended to kill her cut off or is on his right The description of it.And the question shows him to the mortality in his saying: I was asked with any sin that was killed without the supporters with the fact that the sin is for him without it, so that it is like it.For its supporters and its projection from the ritual of the discourse and the exaggeration in its crying; The madman is upon him If he was asked with the presence of the perpetrator and the crime was attributed to him without the side, that was a source of mission to the committee on thinking in the event of itself and the state of the sinner, so it is the same The one who deserves to be trapped and punished, and this is a type of receptor and falls on the way of exposure, as in the words of the Almighty: You said to the people who took me and took me.Abi and Ibn Masoud and Al -Rabi’a were read by Bin Khaytham and Ibn Ya`mar, “I asked”;

Because it is not costly, and some of those who are not accustomed to the hadith of Aisha: He does bad and did not realize him.For a family, they created them for them while they were in the first place of their fathers.And the scholars answered that he may have prayed and peace be upon him from the hurry to the piece of which it will have a sophisticated indication, and it is a ritual, and it is the prayer of the prayer, and it is the prayer of the prayer That he knows that the kindness of Muslims in paradise, when he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, knew that he said that in his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Three of the child did not reach the mortal, except God entered the Heaven with his grace and his mercy to them.As for the two partners, they have three doctrines; The many said: They are in the fire a follower of their parents for a hadith: “He was asked about the children of the partners who die from them as a young person, so he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him.” That is, and otherwise.“The hadith of the righteous of the caliph, peace be upon him, when the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, saw him in paradise around him.The participants said: The children of the participants.And among it is the saying of the Almighty: We were not tormented until we sent a messenger and did not turn to the mandate, and it is obligatory to say the Messenger of the Messenger, and this is the saying Ali, and the answer to the hadith: “God Almighty knows what they were working.They reached and did not reach, and the cost is only with the fraud.And it is followed by what he mentioned from the condemnation in the hadith of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that he would refuse him of what he mentioned from the hadith of Abraham, upon him, for the peace of the peace of God, for the peace A boy from the supporters and his building upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, but it was in it, and the hadith of Abraham, peace be upon him, was with a power that was the phenomenon that he was the one who was the one who was In it, and from him he knows that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The sins of the Muslims in Paradise, and also if the hadith of Abraham, peace be upon him, is in Mecca, the first answer is weakened by the hadith of Aisha, with what he said.It was informed of that hadith, then it was mentioned that the doctrine is in the kindness of the partners three;
