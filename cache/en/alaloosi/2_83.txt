The researcher, when we took the charter of the children of the sons of the honesty in the number of other people of the ancestors of the ancestors of Jews, which calls for the repetition of the faith of their disagreement, and it is said that it is: What God has allocated to it, and that is because the abuse of these things is connected to the greatest of the blessings, which is paradise, and the connection to the grace, and the grace of this On the tongue of Moses and others from their prophets, peace be upon them, or a covenant that was taken upon them in the mourning, and the saying of Maki: It is a covenant that he took, and they are the one who took it.Their fathers are like the atom, their face and face are not here.Do not worship except God on the will of the saying, that is, our saying, or say, to be linked to what is before it, and it is a news in the sense of the prohibition as the saying of it, and there is no one who is harmed, and there is no harm to the She goes to so -and -so, and she says to him Kit and Katt, and that is the gone of the deceased, and it is suggested that he is the most exaggerated of the expression From him until he told him about the situation, or the past, that is, it is not possible to be like that, so it is not possible that the state of the expert is on his own, and that he reads the son The forbidden, and that (they say) is kind to it, and the appropriate appropriateness will obtain between them in their being, and if it is permissible to create the creation on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the same It was said: It is destined to not worship, so when the right is deleted, the verb increased, and it is not obligatory to raise after the deletion in the same way as this The lighter, and its counterpart from the prose of the Arabs: (P-308) is its mastery, and from its systems: ؎ O, O Zajari, bring the abuse, and if I see the pleasure, whether you are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same (That they do not worship) and weaken it that (that) do not delete a measure in the positions that this is not from it, so it is not necessary to exaggerate the verse on it, and on the authority of it, and it will be done by it An allowance from the covenant, or a verb with it by the deletion of the rhythm of the run, that is, by not, or on not, and it was said: It is an answer that is an oath of the words, i.E., that is the solution of them His soul, because he has the ruling of the division, and the words of the words are released from what he passed through the first face of the two rituals, and he read Nafaa, Ibn Amir, Abu Amr, and Asim, When they were attached to it, and those who remain in the same because they are unseen, and in the verse at that time, the two sides, in the memorization of the majesty and (they worship).And in the religion, charity is attached to the guarantee of its estimation: you improve, or improve, and the sentence is given to it (you worship it), and it is a goodness, and it is a goodness, And to, as well as I was good at me from the prison and I do well, as God has improved to you and the prevention of the release of the source of the source of it is a divorce, and the one who is a variety of people, Stand up, (in the religion) are attached to it, (and charity) Its effective, and among them is those who estimated: and their commandments are good, and the good is for its sake, and the parents are the mother of the father, because it is called the father, or the mother, or the mother, or the mother, or the mother, or the mother, or the mother, or the mother It is said only to the father, as the milk went to him, and the verse was indicated by the urging of the righteousness of the parents, and their honor, and the verses and the hadiths in that are many, and it is a lot of it His name is a village of that with his worshipers, and the kinship, the orphans, and the poor are kind to the parents, and the kinship is a source like the ritual, and the thousand is in it, in which it is for the sake And the crucifixion, the orphans, its weight is active, and its familiarity with the ethnicity, and it is a collection of orphans like a so -and -called and my regret, and it is not measured, and it is collected on an imam, and the origin is the origin of it Al -Dura Al -Yatimah, and he said: The foolishness, and the Yatim is called a time because it is overlooked by his righteousness, and Abu Omar said: The frustration of the frustration of the righteousness, and the righteousness of the righteousness, It is not after a justification, and in the Bahaim by the mothers, and in the goodness on their own, and al -Mudardi narrated that it is said in the Adamin of those who lost the mother of his mother, and the first of his mother The poor are the collection of poor people on an effective, and it is derived from the tranquility, as if the pilgrim was rested, so the name is increased as a civilized, from the presence, and the narration, The most correct is that it has become poor, and the difference between it and the poor is known, and it will come if God wills, the Most High, and this repentance came with the goodness of the As their progress is not hidden from one of them, they are not hidden from them, then the kinship, because the compassion of the wombs is confirmed, and for the parents of the parents in the kinship, and for them, and for them, and for them, And he replied in the effect: God Almighty has addressed the mercy and said: “(You are the Most Merciful, and I am the Most Merciful, the origin of those who prayed, and I cut off those who cut you),“ Then with my death, there is no perfection, not for them, for the fullness of them.And he came, "(I and the warlth of the yatim in Paradise are two mothers, and he referred to the captivity and the mediator), and the coffee of the holders was delayed because the poor people can be able to pledge it With the use, and his livelihoods are reconciled with what I can with the disagreement of the orphan, because it is for his minimum, and it is not beneficial to him, and he needs those who benefit from it, Because he wants the spectrum with him, and because his addition to the source is in which every one with a relative, as if there is a sign of it until the distress of the kinship, and if there is a lot of people, no It is made of charity to them, and they say to people good, that is, a good saying, which he called it for the sake of the language, and it was said: It is a language in goodness, such as bread, And the Arabs and the Arabs, and what is meant: they said to them the good saying, and they will give them the best of what they love, the father of the high said, and the Sufyan said: The denunciation, and Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased They are up to them: Say to them: There is no god but God, and they passed them with it, and Ibn Jarraj said: Teach them what is in your book in the attribute of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The high level, and it is clear that this matter is from the sentence of the covenant taken over the children of Israel, and whoever says: The one who addresses the nation, and he is a judge, or a bond, Specialized in the right of the believers, as the good saying is with the infidels and the immorality, because we commanded them with their cursing, and their vilification, and their sacrifice, Hamza, Al -Kisa’i, and Jacob (good) with two conquests, giving, and Jesus with two guilt, which is the language of the Hijaz, and Abu Talah bin Bin Murabar (Hasan) His face, and it was said: It is a ritual export, and the father of Hayyan was exposed, that it is not measured, and it was not heard in it, and it was said: It is a row as a lord, that is, a lord, and that is, The description of it and its purposes: one of them is that it is the rest of it for the precedence, and its accommodation with other thousand and the blame, and the addition to the knowledge is rare, and it came to the one who came in the shame, and it came to the one who came to the one who came in the shame.؎ If you call for a clear and dignified one day as the righteousness of the people of the people, then invite us and the second: to be repeated from the impact, and you will be in the sense of goodness, as they said: His brother, and Al -Jahiri (charity) was read on that he was the most beautiful source of whom is the goodness of the world, as you say: the grasm of the land is a herb, so it is a herb, so it is a herb.Then, it was called a deleted source, that is, a good saying, and establish the prayer and pay zakat, he wanted to give him what they were imposed on them, because they were imposed on them, because they were supposed to be in them.When it was signed in the time of peace be upon him, and the zakat of their mothers was as it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them.The acceptance, and what the fire does not do with it, as well as it was not accepted, and the saying that what is meant by them is this prayer, and this is the zakat that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is for us May God’s prayers and peace be upon him from the sons of Jews, and it is not other than them It hides, then you have taken care of any of the covenant, and you rejected it, and then for the repetition, or for the achievement of the crime, then it will be a stake for the sake A dedicated period, which is more disturbed than the disobedience from the first, and some of the investigators mentioned that if the annexes are made, a discourse, may God bless him and grant him peace, and peace be upon him.Tafsa to the discourse of the children of all of them, by giving their successes to their predecessors, for all their remembrance of all of them, then on the rituals of the absence The ancestors are strictly by saying the estimated saying before you do not worship As if they were involved in the remembrance of their felonies, then we were aware of them, and if it was made a speech for the contemporary Jews, then this is a baptism of the ritual The difference, as it is a blindness to follow the download of the other, the hose of the predecessors to tighten in the stinging, and it was said: The tafs are, but it comes to the readers of (not) On the reading of the discourse, there is no fools, and from the people who made this speech special for those present in his time, peace and blessings be upon him, and what is presented is for the one The two readings, but it is in the meaning that is not related Some of the writers, and what we mentioned of the first and the most disagreement of those who have turned away from it.Except for a few of you and they are from the ancestors who raised the Judaism on the face before the copying, and from the one who is the one who became Muslim as the servant of God ibn Salam, and his nurses, then the less Attiyah: It is enticed to be in faith, that is, not (P-310), he remains when they disobeyed and disbelieved the last of them with praise ﷺ except for a few faiths, as he does not benefit from them Whoever did not give an understanding in the Arabic preservation, and it was narrated from Abu Omar, and others raised a few, and many who are famous in the proverbs of that text, because what is the same, because what is the same, because what is not.And they differed in the graduation of raising, and it was said: The Marifa is a confirmation of the guarantee, or a replacement of it, and it is permissible because (you took it), in the sense of the negation, that is, the one who did not, One of his saying ﷺ: While it is correct for the correctness: “The worlds are only the worlds, and the scientists are only the workers, and the workers are only the creatures, Dangerous), “The poet said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ is an elderly It can be seen by exile, so it is necessary: ​​the people rose only to raise the lifting of the interpretation, and the dispensation, and it is not permissible for the grain, and it is not possible for it to be.It was said: (Except) is a description in the sense of other than, its expression appeared after it, and it was held by its Sibu.It is not, and he was reminded of the example of this section: If there was a man with us except for more, we would be overwhelmed, and if there were gods except God, they would be spoiled and said: A country above a country with a little with the voices, except for its mines and the entire collection of what he preached on this, and in it that that while we are in it, there is no one in it.Asfour, where he went until the description does not violate the description other than where it is described by the denial and the definition, and the most prominent, and the host, and the one Other than him, and he is the son of Shahin with the lineage to him that he is not described by it unless the Muwasouf is denied or known for the words Its position, and it was said: It is a beginner that is deleted.His exalted say: Except for a Plice, it was not from the prostitution, and you are exposed to a sentence that is exposed, that is, and you are the people who have been returned to the symptoms.They are returned from the name indicating one of the evidence, and it was said: a confirmed condition, and the assignment and symptoms are one thing, and it is permissible to separate the affirmative situation in the affliction of the one who is the one who is the one who is the affirmative, and the affliction is with the wow, Some of them are among the consequences and the symptoms that the first may be a need calling for the victory with the evidence Tawal to return his help to his start, and symptoms are to leave the approach and take in the presentation of the way, and the one who is close to the exhibit, because it is a matter He has to return to the curricula of the curious, and the show where the curric is left and took in the presentation of the way, he needs to seek a approach, so he is difficult for him.It is among those who have been allowed to be exposed to his appearance, and the sentence is a restricted state, that is, the few do not take over, and you are exposed to them, so they are soaked, so that they are in them.Tobar for them, and a praise for the few, it is distant, as it says that it is restricted, and the assignment and the symptoms are disturbed, that is, you are in the past in the past Follow this Prophet, may God’s prayers be upon him
