The Quranic researcher, their hearts are sick, and God increased them, and they have a painful torment of what they were lying to the disease with the opening of the Arabs as the one who reads the ritual, and the one who has been brought to the one, Omar, and on what the people of the language went to, is a case that is outside the nature, harmful to the verb, and when the medicine is met, it is the case, which is the case that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one What is meant by the verbs is what is compatible, and it is either as a manner, such as the growth, or a animal like the soul, or the symptoms such as the mourning of the thought, so the righteousness and the wad The language of the language, and the disease may be called a language on its impact, which is the pain, as a group of those who are documented by them said, and on the darkness as it is in his saying: (P-149) From every side, what is felt in it is a cushion, no moon, and on the weakness of the heart, and its eloquence as it is said by one, and it is called a metaphor for what is offered to be the one who is the one Like emptiness, ignorance, bad sterility and envy, and other than the inhibits of the similar tasks of the choice of body, the objection to the taste, and the leading to the destruction The body of the body, and the one who is transmitted from Ibn Masoud, Ibn Abbas and Mujahid, and a murder, and the righteous, the righteous salads, carry the sickness in the verse on the meaning of the metaphor, and there is no doubt The hypocrites were full of those hidden ones that prevented them from what prevented them, and they reached them to the lower way of fire, and there is no prohibition at the time His truth, which is the darkness, and whoever does not make it light for him, because of his light and those who disbelieved their children, the tyrants, they bring them out of the light, to the light, and if the light is to the light to In the hearts of those are great in the midst of Islam and the system of their affairs is the end of the system, so the verse is on this is a reserve for the two eyes, The metaphor is only involved in his appointment without its involvement.Relationship is not the disease, but the pain of the mood is worse, and it is the inconsistency in the hypocrites, and the saying that their condition is the one who is on the authority of it, The hearts of those were if they were satisfied, so their bodies were like that, or if the garments were sooner, and that the hadith of the Prophet is witnessed, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one, ﷺ: “(In the body is chewing)” the hadith, and the second, because the judgment is after that they have shown the expression of the heart.His cover, or from one of them, is the one who has the right to the owner, and if it is not possible to delay life, a period of way And a narration that he carried on the metaphorical meaning, and from the cheese, and the devices, and within that the hearts of the hypocrites, when they witnessed the Messenger of God ﷺ and the believers, and those who witnessed The significance is that it is a type that people are not aware of, and it was not collected as the hearts were collected, because the number of the referred is indicated by the number Its collection, and the first sentence is either a navigator for the basis of their deception, and what they are in hypocrisy, or a decision of what it benefits and what they are in the believer, Or an illusion to him, as if it was said: What do they believe?He said: In their hearts, there is a disease that prevents it, or a decision of the feeling of feeling, even if it is a way to say it: and what they feel the path of the symptoms of what is said to be what is said A disease is either a propaganda that is interrupted between the consequences and the consequences of it, and the opposite may be associated with fulfillment as it is in its saying: the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge Whenever they come as they are stated in the Taloh and otherwise, it is transmitted from the grammarians, or a testimony that is given on the first, and the past is overwhelmed by the name That is not still a funny hatred to the time of the news, and in the second that this is due to the increase in their satisfaction On the believers heal, and this is not repeated with his words: and provides them with their tyrants for the difference between the increase of the disease, and the increase in the tyrant, not from the one who is from the The confirmation is with the distance of the distance, and also the supplication if it is not running over the tongue of worshipers, or it is intended for it, the abstaining of the insult, and the deficiency is positive from it To him, the luxury, and the increase of God Almighty, either by weakening their envy by increasing the blessings of God Almighty on His Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Their hearts by renewing their disbelief in what the Glory be to it is something of the signs and the wise masculinity, so he understood the darkness of some of them, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, or by one, And their fear of the one who is overlooked by the disbelief in the infidelity (P-150), the supply of God, the Almighty, and the raising of his flags on the flags of the bustle, the rituals, or the great With the increase in dignity, and the leadership of the fire.؎ Grunum sees the whipping of the whipping of the boy, and it is honored, and this is with the excess of God, the Almighty, the worshiper, and the act of it, and the act of it, And by leaving the Prophet ﷺ to them with some things, and their successor from the Gallery of what they hate from their mother, and the misunderstanding of them, then they will be, then they will be.And the attribution of the leadership to God is a righteousness, and if it was interpreted by the sword, then it is the right effective the verb of the reasons, And without it, nothing from it, and some of them made the chain of transmission a metaphor in some of the faces, and perhaps it is a dormant dormitory, and the strangers of them said: He was pregnant with the fact that what is meant is that there is no one who increases them with a right disease, on the opinion of Sheikh Abd al -Qahar in that it is not necessary in the rewarding chain of chain The chain of transmission to it is a fact like: it increases you and its face is good.Either he adopted the addition of the added, that is, God increased their hearts, or indicating that the heart of the heart is a disease for the bodies of the body, or a symbol that the heart is the nose, and the heart is the nose, and the heart is the soul The human being is a human being, and the return of a disease denied by his being a deficient for the first, the harm that the increase is the increase in the increase, and the one who is lost is the one who claims that it is the one The host, the denial of the fool, and the elderly is an act of pain, in a sense of act, such as the hearing in a sense of hearing, and on what is gone to the time of the thirty And its chain of transmission to the torment is metaphorical one, and it was not proven to him in a sense of effective meaning, and he was made by the heavens of the heavens, in the sense of the righteousness, that is, the righteousness of the ritual And hearing in his saying: The security of Rayyah al -Da’i al -Sama ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ The most anxiety and thinner is, but it is a matter of souls, and its ideas, so on this, its interpretation is with a painful name that is active in the name of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them: everything in the Qur’an (Alim), so it is painful, and he gathered for the hypocrites as a kind of torment, the greatness of the With the remembrance here, and the rare with the infidels there, it was said: This sentence is exposed to the bid and the Eid of hypocrisy and deception, and the costume is either for the captivity, or for the sake) A source of expression is a source that was, if it was, or with a source of the news, such as liar, or the connection of it, and it appears that the father of the righteous appears.What he wanted in the sea, that it is not necessary to be then estimated, but whoever reads: (they lie) with lightness, and they are the coffee, so the verb is the one who is a good, and the verb is the one who is the one, and the verb is the one who is the one, and the verb, Kansa, Ibn Katheer and Abi Omar, so the act is deleted to the understanding of the meaning, and the appreciation of their being, they lie to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace.It is necessary that the tightened in the sense of the fear of the exaggeration be in the way as they said, in: that the thing is, shown, charity and charity, and it may be the destruction, The camels were died, and it is began to be From the lies of the obscenity if it is running and stands to look behind it, and that is the state of the confused, which is the state of the hypocrite, in the words, then it is a sense of the one who is a dedicator, and this is the same His saying ﷺ: ((The same as the hypocrite is like the one who is the one who is the one who is time, and it is shown to this time, and to this time), and the neighbor and the boundary, not to the sake of the As the father said it is that the origin is in the description that it is not described, and the lie is the liar about the proportional thing or the exhibition on the dispute (P-151) what is on it in the matter Perforishing with the regime, and in them when the Al -Jahiz, and all the intended are a Hamid, who can communicate to it with the sincerity and the lies of all, so the falsehood is for it If it is not possible only by lies, then the lie is permissible, if it is that the intended is permissible, and it is obligatory if it is obligatory, and it is stated in the hadith in the hadith in the hadith, And the righteousness of the same, and the man lied to his woman to satisfy her, and no confinement, and this is permissible to meet those who acknowledge the limits of the return from the one who is the one The spinning of the falsehood and the spoiling arranged on the truth, then the spoil is in the honesty is more harmful, then it has the falsehood, and if it is the opposite of it, then it is the opposite of it, then it is the opposite of it, then it is the opposite of it, The oval imam, may God forgive him, be exalted from him that the lie is all forbidden to be what is in what is in it, and in the verse it is forbidden to the believers, and the believers are upon him The believer, if he hears the arrangement of the torment on the lie without the hypocrisy that is imagined in itself, the name of the lies, and the perception of his mourning, and the imagination A release, and this is an apparent one of the readings, and it can also be, because the sincere lineage to the lies is a lie, and so is the most of it, and that it is in the mind, and it is the most.It is taken from the (lied) of the aggressor, as if he is lying to his opinion, and he stands to look, but when he used it in this sense, and it was the case of the case To be offended from it, it is possible after that, that is the urbanization, and he does not respond to the prohibition of lies in some of his faces, what was narrated in the hadith of the ritual He says: “(I am not for her, I have lied to three lies),” and I mean as in the narration of Ahmad: (I am a slave) and (but he did their greatness), and he said to him) His wife Sara: (She is my sister), when he wanted to disobey her, and it was one of the slices of analogy to be exposed to the souls of marriage without others without their consent, then if it is from the time, then if it is from the time, then if it is from the time, then if it is from it I am the infallibility, and it is the father of the prophet!And if it is not like that, then I have informed the day of resurrection by the difference of the reality, and its entourage, where the concept is from that words: that I am a sin, so I will not be alert, In it, The strength of this suspicion is the severity of the narration in the vicinity of the narration in order to give the surface of the Imam, peace be upon him, because we say: that is from the dawn, and the abundance of it, and in it.It was issued from the master of the first of the infallibility ﷺ as his saying from what is in the hadith of the migration, and his name is a lie on the way to the slogan of the bush in the way, so it is from The sincere, as you will see it with the best face, if God wills exalted in its position, but it was when it was based on the nakedness with the righteousness, and the same is the same With his mother, the stitch is caused by his enemy from the first in his place, so that in that place is a sin, and his name is a lie to his form, and what is for him, and what is for him, and what is for him, and what is for him, and what is for him, and what is for him, and what is for him, Prayer and peace from that did not happen in the same way as this place until he is ashamed of it, for every denomination is an article, on that we say: It is if it was a lie, no He was broken from it, how, and he said, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: “There is no liar except that he ran from the religion of God Almighty)” So he is from the lying, for the sake of the slander, for the sake of the one who is the permissible The hidden fool for the beloved, not the caliphate, the appearance of the fragrance to pay it from what it thinks that it is what is required of that, and it is not obligatory, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that, and in that The payment of the one is the best of what is not hidden, as if he said: I do not believe in the blame on a permissible lie, so how can I have a ruster for you in this place, so let him be, so do not.The one who is in the past of the past verbs is an overwhelming thing as it is like this, and it was almost the same as a difference of them, and it is meaning that it was in the past, it was in the past, it was in the past, it was in the past.With the punishment of the proverbs, the past, and the arrest of the lineage of the rule of judgment, and the recipient of the suffering of my suffering (was), so there is no form of what they were lying) Lying to them in the past, and they lie to his affiliation immediately and inhabited (P-152), and the time is different, and he pushed it that (he) indicated that he was in the same way.(And they lie) indicate the invalid, the unlikely in all the Aznah on his ills, God sings to be exalted, and the hopes of Hamza (and the most of them) Makanwan in his hope came, and he wanted, and this increased, and it is a difference in (Zad) other than it, and the hope is to be permitted, and the disturbance of the curtains, and the father of Hayyan has said: Actions of dust to Hamza ∗∗∗ he came and wiped out, Ran and a whole, and he was disappointed, and he was afraid of his fear.
