The Quranic researcher, O those who believe in God Almighty and what came from him if you are present, that is, you are treated, and some of you will be treated, some of you, with a good remembrance of his remembrance, Because (you came) comes in the sense that you are treated with a debt, and in the sense that you are rewarded, and it is not mentioned that the context raises it, because the words are in the texts that there is no one.The mutation, and it was said: He was mentioned to return to him, as if he had it, he said: Write the debt, so it was not the purpose of that goodness, with the goodness, It was assumed that the convergence is indicated by it, so that it will be from the chapter, they are the closest and it is answered that the debt is not intended for the source, but rather one of the people, no Where the context is not satisfied with it in the presentation of the Bayan, especially while it is dressed.When he was specially specialized, and if he was not mentioned, he would not be able to do that the debt is only so that it is for the sake of any time, and it is attached It is postponed to a term named by the days, the most famous, or their organizations, which benefits the science and raises the ignorance, not by the harmony of the harvest, so that it does not come back to it He wrote it, that is, the religion for its sake, because it is a junction and a document; And the gathering of his mobility for his saying, his grace: if some of you are safe and the verse is when some appeared in that every debt of the rule of you, and the authority of you The religion with Muslim has been brought out by Bukhari from him that he said: I bear witness that the predecessor who is included to a later name is that God is the highest of it, and the permission of it, then the one who has been in it, then On the binding of the loan.Let a writer write among you a justice for the Kayfiyyah of the book that is taught to it and the help of those who take care of it, the matter of it, and the effect of the book of the book.By his understanding or intention to the rhythm of the same action, and to be pious with the knowledge of the atheism that he will be informed of the writers that he will not be reluctant to do so.And the neighbor is attached to a deletion, and it is a description of the writers, that is, to be the writer from his level of equality, and the inclination of the inclination to one of the two sides with an increase, or a decrease A lukewarm attached to his writers or by his act, and what is intended is the one who is on the way to the way of the writing of a justice, so it is a debt until it will be what it is in what is written in it He agreed upon him among the people of science, for words, as Al -Tibi said, is a marketer for a meaning, and a merit in it is another with the sign of the text, which is the intensity of the jurisprudence in the rituals of the ritual in the mind The settlement in matters (P-56) is dangerous except for those who were understand The chames are only a disobedient, and whoever does not have a person, as well The spoilers.And a writer does not refuse, meaning that no one of the writers is not obedient to what is written among the books, as he wrote among the two religious writers, as God knows what God has known to him The book of charity is preferred by him, and he is attached to a writing and the words of a limit and good, as God has improved to you, so that he does not refuse to do so It is for the sake of God, the Exalted, preferred to him and his advantage, and it is permissible for the sufficient to be suspended that he will be written on that he is a mourning for a minor or a state of one or a state Sibuyeh, and the ability to write a book like what God has taught, or to write it, that is, the books, such as what God has taught him, and God bless him: With justice, and he is up to be attached to the words of the Almighty: let him write and fulfill other than a reason, as in your Lord, and grow up because it is a prayer in the meaning, and the matter is from the matter, and the matter is from it The first is to confirm, and take it to it because the forbidding of the thing is not an order against it, as well as the most correct, so make it sure of his remembrance, and the best of this Some of them indicate that the matter is for the obligatory and from the shows of sufficiency, but the matter is what we have, we have no way for that, so that what is presented in the matter of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake, The second: Do not be sure, but rather it is an order of the restricted writing after the forbidding of the abstinence from the divorce, and this does not benefit the affirmation, because the forbidding is from the one who does not know The matter is restricted to be his remembrance after him, and he called him some because if if the abstinence of the book of the book is forbidden, then it is for the sake The legitimacy is forbidden by the first way, and the forbidding of the abstaining from the law is a matter of it, so the matter will be in writing - the law, the one who is good Related and restricted, and one is one who carries the divorced woman, whether the divorced or delayed is presented, so the matter is made in the divorce of the first in the first place The restricted writing is to benefit the affirmation, so why is the forbidden to abstain from the divorce of the book on the restricted writer of the confirmation, and the confirmation of the affirmation, Judging it as it is not hidden?!And (what) it was said: either a source or all of it and it is permissible to be connected or described and on them, so the guarantee is for it, and on the first of the writers;

of the doubles may change J, and the source is followed by it, and it will be replaced by a prodigy to delegate it after an increase in a thousand, so it is said: And let the one who is the one who is the one who writes it from the debt that the right he writes is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is required to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not Relax judgment with description, for you are the ruling on the description of the highness and the origin of the highest cause The beautiful name and the beautiful description are exaggerated in the urbanization of piety by mentioning what is felt by the majesty and the beauty and does not underestimate, that is, it does not decrease (from it), that is, from the right to the right And if it is wise, and it is read (something) with the expulsion of the hammer (and something) with tension.This is the interpretation of Said ibn Jabir, and it was said: It is permissible to return the guerrilla (he who fears) to the writers and not with something because it is a guarantor ( He is the one from which the underestimation is signed, and the writer signs from him the leadership as he signs from him the deficiency, so if he wants to end it (P-57) (P-57) So, where he commanded justice and return each of them, for each of them, dismantling that does not indicate a sign of it, but rather in the abandonment of the mantle of the one who is in the authority And it is forbidden for the underestimation, because it is in it from the references to the one who is forbidden for it, for the human being is obligatory to pay the harm to it.And in (from him) and Jahan: one of them: to be attached to (licking) and (from) to seek the end, and secondly: that it is attached to the deletion of it, because it is in the case of the righteousness of it.It was presented to him immediately, and (something) is either an effective or a source.If the truth was stated in

have a submissive news and the right is a late beginner, so the sentence will be a name, and on the two estimates, there is no place for it to be a place that is a place for it.Sorry, that is, an impoverished, firm, the son of Zayd said, or is ignorant of the hope, said by Mujahid, or a sowing of his affiliation and spoiler for his debt.Difficulty, or is not able to tire a sentence that is given to a paradise that is a (it was) to be interpreted by the individual, any or other than the one who is unable to do so As it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, or for what is better than him and from ignorance of the language and the man who is the abnormal syntax, and the guarantor of the righteousness of the In (to be tired) and the most confirmation of it is the lifting of the metaphor, which was tolerated by the action of the verb to the conscience and the prescription that it is It is not capable of itself, and it was said: The guerrilla is an act of (dictate) and the change in the hearts of the hearts of the negation, and it does not hide the goodness of it.And the same as the jaw in his saying is up to the Almighty: let him be filled with him, that is, the one who takes care of his command, and if he is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the values, the ritual, the ritual, and the one who is the one who is the values, and the agent, and the agent, and the agent.In the same way as this picture is an acceptance, and a difference between it and between the ritualization of others, so know it with justice

that is, to ask them to carry the testimony of what happened between you, and it is permissible to be the Sunnah and the two are increased, i.E., any of the two witnesses; And in the choice of the form of the exaggeration, a gesture to seek the one who has been repeated from the testimony, so it is a scholar of its fall, as it is in its performance, as if it has a symbolism, because it is a symbol of it, because it is not a symbol of it.The person with the rulers is only an acceptance of them and perhaps he did not say two men to that, and the matter is for the delegate or to the obligatory of your righteousness in your righteousness.(Cemeter) and (from) to see the absence, or with a deletion that it is a characteristic of two martyrs, and (from) the menstruation and the discourse of the believers in the faithful, and in the good.In addition to the guarantee of the addressees' significance of Islam, fraud and maleness in the two witnesses and freedom, because the one who is among the full men and the sophistication of the people of the people of the picnic The rhetoric of the law does not increase the slave of the veil as it was shown in its place, and the imam went to the numbness of the freedom of freedom in the acceptance of the testimony, but the testimony of the testimony, They have Islam and the equivalent, and to that, Sherih and Ibn Sirin, Abu Thawar, and Uthaman al -Batta, are the disagreement of the narrator on the authority of the honor of God, the Lord of God.The servant is in anything, and the verse was not exposed to the testimony of the infidels with each other, and that was permitted by the measuring of Imam, Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him, and God is pleased with him.If no martyrs are two men That is, they did not mean their martyrs, even if they were in the way and the ruling before the negative of the general, not the general denial of the negation, otherwise it is not correct to say: Two men are two men, so that a man and two things are witnessed, or a man and two women who testify or stop, or the witness is a man and a man, or two of the two, or two, or two men, or two, or two of the men, And two things, or let them be a man and two witnesses, and if they were made complete, I will seek me from the appreciation of witnesses, and the sufficiency of the man in the man The limits and the reins of us, and when the Shafi’i in the money is in particular, not otherwise, like the contract of marriage, and Malik said: The testimony of those are not permissible in the limits, nor the shame, nor the ritual Akkal and the commandment, if there is no fear in it, and the acceptance of the martyrdom of the women is a paradise, then they said about it in the birth, the ka`ir, the consumption, and what is done in the course of that Jurisprudence, and reading (and two women) with a huge gossip, and perhaps that is to save the burning.Whoever you are satisfied with attached to the deletion of a row of (a man and two things), that is, who are those who are satisfied with them, and the expansion is with that Every testimony of the few who is described by the women, so what is in the “sea” does not want to be in the “sail” from making it a row for the remembrance that feels that this is a clear one, For two martyrs and weakened the separation between them, and it was said: It is a replacement from your men with the repetition of the worker and weakened the chapter also, and the choice of the father of Hayyan, Certain in the whole and the chapter is obligatory between the two women’s

deleted, the one who is from those who are satisfied with them as if they are the ones who are the one who is the one who knows the Women in the collection with the way of challenging.If you are misleading, then the last one is mentioned by the rule of the rulings of the judgment and the number of numbers in the women, that is, the legitimacy of that is the will to remember the one that is mentioned.One of them was lost because the forgetfulness is overwhelmed by the printing of the women for the many humidity in their mixture And he sent him to him, and he is not here except the will of God, to be cut off, by the fact that the misguidance and the memory after it is not the source of the matter, but rather the will of that, and it is the same, For testimony, it is not possible for God to be exalted with the legal will, especially and it was commanded by the guidance, and I answer that the will is not You are attached to the misguidance itself, it means the number of feuding for the testimony, but rather the delusion that arises from it, and from their obstacles that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ritual Done by remarking about the misguidance and the arrangement of it, so the explanation is taken to what we mentioned, and this is what is what the one went to the answer to the answer that the misguidance is that the misfortune is that the misfortune is that Because of the remembrance, so I will give up the cause and want the caused by the appearance that he does not remain on his backs, a meaning for his saying: So, then he remembers the one who said: It is misleading, etc.It is mentioned that the nods are lost to the severity of the fulfillment of the taste of remembrance, in which it became (p-59) what is its deceitful as if it is required for the sake of the time To him, and (one) the second is permissible to be an actor (remember) and not to put the appearance of the place of the host, as the remembrance is not, and it is the male, and it is not the male, Understanding to (remember) and the other is an active and not before Moses, Jesus, as it was concerned until the first

effective on the alert the alert is to be fulfilled by the reminder of the lost, and this is what is said to the Dahir, because the adherence is then not alerted to the fulfillment, as it is alerted to it.Its original position.And one of the same was mentioned that the enemy is reminded of its other, and it is the reader of the son of Masoud, as it was narrated by the souls of what is in the generous system, so that it is the most generous.The delusion of the misguidance of the misguidance of themselves with its eyes and the memory of the last, and the one who was al -Husayn ibn Ali al -Maghribi in this place, so he made the first of them) The two testimonies, and the other (one of them) to the two women, so the meaning is that one of the two testimonies is misled That the people are not called a lost testimony, but rather it is said: the testimony was lost if it is lost as he said his chains: The appearance is a head, and it is not a thing, as it is not for them to be in the words with the arrival of disassembly and the integrity The language, in “the end of the son of the archaeologist” and otherwise the release of the lost to the people, and that was narrated in the verse on the authority of Saeed ibn Jubayr, Al -Dhahak, Al -Rabiq, Al -Rabi.This is approached in the western what was said: It is one of the interpretation of the interpretation, which was narrated from the son of Ayen, that the meaning of it, then it is mentioned, and it will be made, so it will be made.They were in the home of the male, because there are shortcomings from the meaning of the meaning and the preservation because the remembrance is in the interview of the forgetfulness, the meaning of the one who is a shame, and the custody of the The humanity is the place of the forgetfulness as well, and because making it a male is a metaphor for its residence in the place of the male, then it is permissible secondly because they are the two places of his place, so they did

from their shortcomings from that as well and the commitment to which it is like that, and it is like that, and it is in the way of it.When the people of the hugs were the eyes of the preferab, and I saw in the “Al -Ma’al Al -Majal” that Al -Khafaji asked the judge of the judges, Shahab al -Din al -Ghaznawi, on the authority of the one who is the secret Al -Maghribi, and he said: “The head of the people of the world, the righteousness, and whoever denounced it on all the irrigation, spread it ؎ what is pleased to be one without the remembrance of it ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ؎ The most beautiful

remember) with the custodian of the lashes and the broken kaf, and the garment (if it is misleading) on ​​the condition, so it is mentioned by raising and on that, then the verb is the same For the meeting of the two, and the fulfillment of the penalty, it was said: to be able to begin with the guarantee of the story or the testimony, and it was said: Do not be able to be able, because the penalty is if it is a harming And he left it, and it was said: The one is that the beginner is destroyed by the conscience of the male and (one of them) as a result of it or from the guerrilla in (it is mentioned) and said some of the investigations: The estimation of the guarantee of the supply is that they remember the last of them, and there are many words of Arabs, and those who say about that are separated from what they have seen, when they were seen.The lifting of the lifting of the Almighty saying: Whoever returns, then God will take revenge on him and do not overlook that that is from the one who is able What is required is the place, not from the side of the guarantor, individuals, and the trinity, and God Almighty is the inspiration for the guidance, so he managed.The testimony

said: it is not the same, and it is not.It was said: What is meant by the lazy boredom is that he had it for him because he fell in the Qur’an as a description of the hypocrites as his saying: “And if they rise to the prayer, they do not.” The believer says I was lasted, but I say it is a weight.And he was read (and they are not bound to write it) with them.A young or old, two cases of the
