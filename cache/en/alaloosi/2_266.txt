The Quranic researcher is one of you Evil and ritualism, that is, any of these two sexy in the sense that they are the knees and the origin in which there is no one in it that there is no one in it, and the one who said: A group of palm trees, which is the name of a gathering sex, and the grapes of grapes, and it is said that the captives are said, so it is not spent to the thousands of the muddam, and where it came in the Qur’an, and where it came in the Qur’an.Rather, it is stated in the palm tree without its fruit and on the fruit of the generosity without its trees, and perhaps that is because the palm tree all of them are beneficial and the uncle is worse, it is the world, and it is the world, it is the world, it is the world, it is the world, it is The sky is eating every time with the permission of her Lord, and the great benefits of the generosity, his fruit without his wickedness, and in some antiquities and I did not find it in a book that is a book that he said: You are atone for me while I am the creator of grapes, and heaven is called on the luxurious trees, and on the ground that is covered by it, and the first is the first to say: The rivers, as on the second, it needs to be added to the addition of any of its trees, as well as it needs to make the chain of narrators to it, while it will come in metaphor; And the sentence in the position of lifting a liquid (paradise) or in the position of a staple in a state of it to describe it as the neighbor and the boundaries before.He has in it from all the precursors of the first kind: in the lifting of a submitted news, and the second: a state of the stereotypes that are stated in the news, and the third: a mourning for the beginning Or a fruit of all the fruits, and the increase in Ziad (from) on the gold of the lighter, and then he does not need the saying of the beginning, and on the one With the general thumbs, but it is the many, and from the people who passed away from the one who is intended from the benefits of the benefits, and this makes the remembrance of you the Golden of the Golden of the Golden of the Golden So, and among them is those who said: This is from the remembrance of the year after the private of the Tamim, and there is nothing.And the greater was hit by any effect in which the age of the age and the sheikh is the most generous of the oldest, the waw of the state, and the sentence with the ability to be in the place That is in this case, which is the suspicion of the intensity of the pilgrim to the benefits of that paradise and the miracle of the miracle of the reasons for the reasons for the pension, and it was said: Waw for the kindness The hardened as the deceased said, or the first of the past is the past, that is, if he had a paradise, and the greatest wounded him, and the father of Hayyan exposed him to that, that there is an entry And the greatest injury is that no one will wish for it, and the answer is that this is not and is bad, because the interrogation of the denial, so it denies the collection between them and does not hide what is in it.He has a weak offspring in the position of the situation The guilt is in his affliction, that is, the greater was afflicted, and the situation has a twinning boy who does not appreciate the gain and the installation of its pension and their pension, and the weakness is the whole.Supreme, and leaving the expression with young people with the interview of oldness, because it is because it is not hidden, and a weak reading is a hurricane, that is, a wind that is running on the authority of the soul.The lighthouse is called the lobby, and it may be a habit and may be upset, a dispute of what is understood by the appearance of the words of one of the one who specializes in the first A wind was separated from a cloud, and the descent intended, and its opposition is on the way of its descent, a piece of the clouds, and its shock from under it, and its payment from it, so that it is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is on the authority.Davids, a motivation from the high and a bush from the bottom, so he will be offered from the two of the two of the two who are the one who will be rented and perhaps (P-38) increased it, so it is the opposite of the rival Poetry is not to be excluded by the reason for its scents, and because of the second: that the salty material if you reach the earth and put it in a grave, then a ritual, then the rituals of it.From her destination, she came to her, and she has also happened from the two scents of Shadidin, and they may have reached its strength to where the trees are immersed, The sign of the descending is that it is a fool that escalates and descends with the dancer, and the mark of the endeavor is that its vineyard is only seen.It is not the same as the prestige of the appearance and perhaps the light of the fabrics on the sins of a powerful, strong and strong sins, so there is a fire that is also going on, and to be aware of this nomad By saying it, they are: there is a fire and the reminder of the guerrillas to adopt the remoteness in it, but it was called a hurricane because it is wrap The clouds are packed or the bodies passed through them, and the intention of the fire is to glorify and narrate the son of Abbas that the hurricane is the stretching, and the rituals are divorced And the hurricane was mentioned and described it with what was mentioned, and he did not confine the remembrance of the fire as if it was said, and it was a fire, so it was broken to that of that sentence of the rhetoric of the rhetoric of the rhetoric Looking, and the verb, who is associated with the fulfillment of its affliction and it was said: on the deleted, the most kind to it, that is, it is burned, so it was burned, and this is as long as it was narrated from the one who narrated He spends and guarantees his spending what he loves in wasting and regret if the day of resurrection is and his need is very tired of that and found him a source of whom is this.And Abd al -Hamid narrated from Ata that Umar ibn al -Khattab, may God be pleased with him You will be for him) etc.Ibn Abbas said: O Emir of the believers, I am finding myself From it, Omar said to him: So why do you pass your soul?!And he said: O Emir of the believers, this is an example that God Almighty has hardened, and he said: I love one of you to be his age, doing the work of the people of the good and the people His majesty and his greatness was heavily and he wiped out what he would have sealed his work with the best of the work of the work of the people of sins, so he spoils his work, so he said: He said: He said: He said: And I like it.And in the narration of Bukhari and Al -Qukham and Ibn Jarir and a group of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them This verse has come down to one of you, etc.They said: God Almighty knows, and Omar is angry, and he said: They said, we know, or we do not know, and Ibn Abbas said: In my soul from it, something, O Mir al -Mu'minin, who is the one who said: Do you think of your soul, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said: I was drained to a rich man who worked with the obedience His work, it was said: This is better than being a representative of those who invalidate his charity with who is harmful, harmful and loud, and he was separated from him to connect him to what he mentioned, not for him, so that he did not.And I answer that he has a work that is rewarded for him, according to his apparent condition, and he thought that he is enough for the representative, and you know that this does not pay that The Qur’an is enhanced and the updated Emir, may God be pleased with him.Likewise, that is, like that, the clear, clear, in the back, the course of the good things, God shows you the verses, so that you think that you think [266] And consider what you include from the lesson and work with it, or perhaps you do your ideas as it is annihilated and it is brought from the world and what is in the rest of you in the rest And you spend what God has given you and you want in the hereafter and do not do what grieves you in it.
