Because they did not inform the testimony of their saying: the hills, that is, they are: the ones.Rather, the life of any: but they are a life, and the sentence is given to you, do not say a warrant for it, and it is not from the kindness of the individual on the individual; Let him be in the matter of saying, and to become the meaning, but (say beyond); Because what is meant is to prove life for them, not their matter, that they say in their affairs that they are life, even if that is also correct.But you do not feel any: do not feel and do not realize what they are with feelings; Because it is one of the conditions of the park that is not informed of it, nor a way to know about it except with the revelation, and it is different in this life, so he went to many of the sins.And the body, but we do not realize it in this creation, and they inferred in the context of his words to the Almighty: when their Lord is grateful Their properties, so they do not have a bias with that of those whom they are, and some went to the fact that it is spiritual, and their universe is to provide that it does not contradict that; It was narrated from Al -Hasan: that the martyrdom is life for God - the Almighty - their livelihoods are presented to their lives, so the light and the joy will reach them, as is the light of the light, as well Pharaohs, tomorrow, and he will reach them, so the pain of them will reach them They are sought by the increase of near God - the glory of his affairs - and the increase of joy and dignity.Al -Balkhehi went to the denying the act by them, and he brought out the nominal sentence indicating the recipient of the one who is not the one who is not killed by Dahir.And he said: The meaning of life is that they revive the Day of Resurrection, and they will be rewarded with the best of the penalty.Response to the participants; Where they said: The companions of Muhammad, who kill themselves and come out of the world without extensive and they are distracted They went out, and some of them went to prove the ruler life to them with what they have received from the beautiful remembrance and the generous praise, as it was narrated on the authority And the scholars are the rest of the eternity of their predecessors and their effects in the hearts are supplied, and it was narrated from the deaf that what is meant by death and the life of misguidance and guidance; That is, do not say they are the ones in religion, straying from the straight path, but they are Upon obedience, they are based on their fathers, and it is not hidden that these sayings - the first of the first - in the end of the weakness, but the end of the hero, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Ibn Abbas, Qatada, Mujahid, Al -Hassan, Amr ibn Ubayd, Wasl ibn Ata, Al -Juba’i, Al -Ramani, and a group of immorality, but they are in the way, but they are in the way, but they are the one who disappeared, It was said: It is this body that was destroyed by the killing, and God - the exalted - is not miraculous - that a life will be permitted to be the cause Survivor on the ground, he does not leave nor see anything from the signs of life.We do not see that; As the ritual is an other stirring with a isolated from our groans and our strength, and it was said: Another body on the image of the bird is attached Abdullah ibn Kaab ibn Malik, he said: The Messenger of God -may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -said: God - the Almighty - Reclores it - the Day of Resurrection.Ali and peace be upon him - he said: “P -21) are the signs of the martyrs in the wages of a good bird that is attached to the fruit of paradise - or the trees of paradise -” Masoud, whipped: It is in the wages or in the arrival, it is all in that pictures; He said: I saw so -and -so - and to that some of the imams went - and they inferred what Abu Jaafar had brought out, supporting Yunus ibn Dhabiyyan, he said: I was a son of God People say in the souls of the believers?From making his soul in the arrival of a green bird that will be inspired by the believer if God has seized him - the exalted - he was filled with his soul in a template like his domain in the world, and he is eating The Qaddam has known to them with that image that was in the world.So he knows from him the state of the martyrs, and that their souls are not in the arrivals with the first way, and when life is in the barking is fixed to everyone who dies of A martyr and otherwise, and that the souls - and if they are a sense of itself - are a deficient of what he feels from the body, but there is no reason for its attachment to the beginning The dense, and that is not from the harmony that the people of the delusion went to, but rather if it is not to the body of itself, which was in it - the one who was in it - in which it was in it - and it was in it - - Rather, if we said that it is a long time for it, and the adultery of us to the body is similar to what was in the world, it is covered on the parts Consistency as well; Because they said it on the face of the face of the wise and the restoration, and they have proven in it the world of the world It is only in the first place of attachment or in the same life based on the fact that it is from the doubtful, not the obedient, or in the soul of the one who is attached to it with what is gone to it with what is the one And the nakedness of them, and which tends to the heart to it that your eternal naches are completely similar to the pictures of these eternals, and that the materials are different and the parts are different; As a separation between the two worlds - and two hazers between the two rituals - and it is possible to carry the hadiths of the bird on the likeness of these eternity, the good, the goodness of the Where I willed with the green, and the image is carried on the righteousness as it was carried on that in the hadith: “Adam was created on the image He exalted him - what is presented to the public that the public understands from the appearance of the memorizers, and for the more clear clarification of the time of his time, it is not a matter As it is a phenomenon of the hadith, even some of the scholars, so they hold (in) in it (Ali) and it is either ignorant or ignorant of that the young man was suspended or not We do not harm the soul, and it does not contradict its nursing, or he thought that this image has a spirit other than the spirit - the martyr - so it is not possible for it to be attached to it They think, and if you want to represent the soul, it is a picture, because the signs are in the end of the kindness, and in it the power of the embodiment is as it feels it.- With the image of the diligence of the dog - may God be pleased with him.That is far from the ability of those who start creation and then restore it - but there is not a lot of need for him, and there is no more than a good, and there is no greatness, and there is no great The weakening of the believers with doubts and the accusations and their deposit from otherwise, without the belief in what they are considered to be the one who has the end of dreams, and what is narrated from (P-22) The view of some of the testimonies who have been killed since hundreds of years, and that to the day, their wounds are seen if the gang is raised from it;
