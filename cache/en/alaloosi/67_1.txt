The Quranic researcher (P-2) Surah of the King, and it is called to be blessed, the manners, the escape, and the argument.The objection." Al -Tarmahi and others were brought out from Ibn Abbas, who said: “Some of the companions of the Prophet ﷺ were struck by a grave, and he does not count that he is a grave, so if a grave is a grave, a person is a person.He was sealed, and the Prophet came ﷺ and he told him, and the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “It is the manner that is saved by the torment of the grave.” Al -Tabrani and Al -Qukham and Ibn Mardawi and Abd Bin Hamid broke out in his chain of transmission and he was preserved for him from Ibn Abbas that he said to a man: He said: I said: Read your refrigeration, which is in his hand, the king [the king: 1] and taught it to your family and all of your children and your youth in your house and your gossip, for it is the savage and the argument To read it and ask him to save him from the torment of the fire and save her owner from the torment of the news.In the camels of the readers, it is also called immunity, and it is an angel at the most correct.It was said other than three verses of them, and the son of Joiber was brought up in his interpretation of the laughter of Ibn Abbas, and in a strange saying that it is a civilian and one of them is one of the one The last and thirty in the rest, and I will come, if God wills, may He be close to what he would like to.And its adequate appeals to what he accepted that it was the highest when it was struck by the disbelief with your two women who are destroyed by them with the grief, even if you are under the authority of the Prophet The believers are in Asia and Mary, and they are impeded to them with happiness.His property is what preceded him.(P-3) It was said that the first of this is connected to the saying of the last of the last divorce, who created seven heavens [divorce: 12] because of what is in it is more And he separated the prohibition of the prohibition because it is like a piece of the surah of divorce and the fulfillment for it, and it came in its virtue a lot of news from it, which passed a nose and what is the one who is the one who was exalted Al -Tarmahi and Al -Nasa’i and Ibn Majah and Al -Kadam and his authenticity and others from Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of God said ﷺ: He was forgiven for him, which is in his hand.And from what came in a hadith narrated by Al -Tabrani and Ibn Merdawi, with a good bond of Ibn Masoud, and another narrated from him a group and corrected by the ruler: And he repented." Ibn Mardawi was brought out from Aisha, “The Prophet ﷺ used to read the pain (downloading) the prostration (and your hand in his hand) And for this, and it is said that its readers are delegated to each Nights.And praise be to God who has strengthened me for its readers, as well as since I reached the age of teaching to the day, and I ask God Almighty to fulfill the aftermath.And I saw in some of Al -Bukhari’s evils to delegate its readers at the vision of the Crescent, the hope of the memorizers of its conquest in that month in the blessing of its thirty and the thirty.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful In the first sense, which is the one who lives in the place by administering his exaltation, and above what he has in himself, his attributes, his acts, and the form of interaction for the vigor in that of what is in that, as well Its lineage is imagined to him as a form of formula as an arrogance.And on the second by adopting a lot of what is running away from him, his chains are on his creatures from the art of goodness and formula at that time, then it is permissible to be the benefit of that Fear, and I am in accordance with their resurrection or their relationships.It was said: And to sign it with the end of the money and its prophecy of the end of the majestic, it is not permissible to seek its resilience in the right of it otherwise, it is not the right of it.Blessed and exalted.And (passed) the words of the words in this place and its chain of transmission to the connection to the righteousness in the matter of the prayer on the verge of its assumption that it is the one that is intended to do so And the evacuation is based on the fact that the king is a liking liking for that and does not allow anything of his individuals, or that the king is on his right and the slave of the sake of the sake of the sake It was said, and to call for that, seeking to seek the description of it with the aggravation of others in his existence and the levels of his presence.The king is not like that, and therefore it was said here in the meaning of the meaning of the verse: the exalted and most of the self of everything that it has itself, the same, and the verb of the whole, the sake of all.Its exalted, and it is an amount that is destined to do so, because the first century indicates the complete behavior in the struggles of the merits of the paths of it.Unlike a dispute, no defendant, in which it is unjust, as it is permissible, as it is permissible for him to be able to present the custody, and this is indicated by the full capacity, and the whole, and the whole, and the one It is not that the transgression of the transgression of the change of the property of the king as he sees from the behavior of the metaphor, so it is a porn in the second to the second.Restricted the expatriates and to find the behavior that is developed in it and to find itself and others, and then it is followed by the description of the extension of the extension of the Al -Tayyibi, and the owner of the scouts is a choice In the first century, what we mentioned in it from the specialization in the supplies, and he said: That is, the highest and most of the attributes of the creatures who are in his hand, the king, on the authority Specialization in the enemy and he said: It is all that there is no existence from what is entrusted under the capacity is destiny and its face is on what is in the revelation that the thing is that it is in general, and it is in general.It is told about it, but when he came with the ability, he was seen in the enemy to seek the abuse of the actor when the condemnation of the two who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And the Zamakhiri and his companions.As for (P-4), who say that the cause of the miracle is the place like the investigators, because the choice calls me before the numbers.He came with the second villages, as well as because the one who is in the way of which is the illusion of a shortage and the choice of the owner of Al -Qarib, that his saying is the one who said: Extracting.And he said it, and he is on all things, in general, because the thing was placed for him, so he may be the intention of the destiny first, and its general is second, and it was not the same, and it was not the same.And we look at it that the thing is either that it is specialized in the supplies or the struggle is included and the host O God, except that he is said to be allocated to him to see what he accepted, as he devoted it to the fence, and in it also a look, if if the second was permitted, the second will be fulfilled.About the ability, if you specialize in it, as it is gone, the first is allocated to the one, and if you do not specialize, the second is not specialized in the second His descent of what we said about him and was supposed to him and answered what they do not give away from a look, so he will be contemplated.Among the people who carried (the king) on ​​the merits and made it a metaphor for the ability, so the meaning will be in his estimated capacity, and he will be punished, and he will be punished with it.The salvation of it is either by making the hand a metaphor for the disclosure or the interpretation of the king by exporting, and it was said that the person is from the king of the king in his hand, and he is glorified, and he is glorified, and he is the same.The king of the king and the rituals (the king) was interpreted in the same way as the gossip of the thing that is in it with the ruling, and it is popular with the world of martyr And there is no intention here as it is not hidden.
