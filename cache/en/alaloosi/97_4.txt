The Quranic researcher said it: The angels and the spirit are revealed in it, a clear exile for the areas of its virtues over that time, and the guarantee of it is for it.The sentence is a description for a thousand months, and the guarantee is for it and there is nothing, and it is permissible for some of them as the universe of the angels for the angels that the "spirit" is a start, not the one who is not.Its news is not related to "descending" and the sentence is a state of "angels".It is the disagreement of the phenomenon.And the soul when the public is Gabriel, peace be upon him, and it was dedicated to the increase in the increase in its honor with the removal.It was said: A great king, even if the heavens and the earth had a single summit, and it was mentioned in the facilitation of his description of what the minds of the minds, and the knowledge.And he said as a play and a fight: The spirit is a sect of angels that the angels do not deny only that night like the beasts that are the ones (P-195) that we see only the day of Eid or the Friday.It was said: A memorization of the angels, such as the angels, the memorization of us.It was said: The creation of the creation of God is the Almighty who eat and wear it from the angels, nor from humanity, and create what they do Clear the people of paradise.It was said: It is Jesus, peace be upon him, descending to the readers of this nation, and for the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and it was said: It was said: The mercy is as it was read: “Do not despair from the spirit of God” by the guarantee and the first one, and the most promising who testifies to the news that the revelation is to the one who is the same God mentioned the Almighty after, and he will come if God wills the Almighty to speak to him, and it was said: They will come to them to seek peace.It was said: Because God Almighty has made the virtue of this night in the preoccupation with his fear in the land, so they will come down to it to make their obedience to the most of the reward for the most rewarded To make his obedience, like that, it will be the intended of the news, so that the human being is in obedience.Issam al -Din said: It is possible that they will be revealed to her awareness; As it is not in the sky, there is no night, and the sentence is then determined, as it is preceded, and it is not clear to the virtues of virtue, and in which there is no hidden view.It was said otherwise that we will refer to it if God Almighty wills.It was said: What is meant is their descending to the worldly sky, which is the disagreement of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is intended to be descended from it.By God, the Exalted and the Exaggeration of the Pleasure of His Majesty, Glory be to Him, and they will be delivered to the believers.It was noteworthy that what is meant by the angels, peace be upon them all, and formed that they have a great large number that the earth does not bear the land, as well as the sky; Because it is before their descent.“The sky was folded and the right to it Take; There is no position in it, except for a king who is prostrating, piercing, or standing.And I answer that they descended a wave, so whoever descends and is ascending like the arguments, then they are on their many, they enter the kaaba, for example, with the best of their family, no Rather, they are among the inside and outside.And in the expression of the "descending" of the useful of the treachery without the symbolism of it, and it was said: They are for them to be lights that are not crowded between them, so the light is from them, for the light is not.Establish a thousand lights on it, and it is as it is seen.Among the people who specializes in the angels with some of their teams, and they are the inhabitants of the Sadra of the end, or some of them.And in the richness of the Rabbani al -Sheikh, Abd al -Qadir al -Kilani, his secret was sanctified from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him Jabriel, peace be upon him, will go down to the earth and with him the inhabitants of the Sadra of the end of the seventy of a thousand king, and with a loyalty of light, then if they are tied to the land For his brigade and the angels, peace be upon them in the four of the citizens of the Kaaba and the grave of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him Sana, then Gabriel says, peace be upon him: they separated; They are separated, and there is no house, no stone, no house, nor a travel in which a believer or a believer is unless he entered the angels upon them, except for a house, or a house in it, A side of a deprivation or a portrayal of commendable, so they praise, sanctify, humiliate, and ask forgiveness for the nation of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, if he is upon him and peace be upon him.Then they escalate the sky, and they will accept the population of the world, and they say to them: Who did you accept?They say: We were in this world; Because the night is the night of the fate of the nation of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and the inhabitants of the worldly sky say: What God Almighty did with the mother of God Ali and peace?Jabriel, peace be upon him, says: God Almighty has forgiven them for their good and raised them in their honor.So the angels of the world raised their voices with praise, sanctification, and praise for the Lord of the two worlds, thank you for what God has given the highest of this nation, from the forgiveness of the one who is forgiven.The thickness of the worldly sky to the second is like that, and so on to the seven, then Jabriel says, peace be upon him: O weapons of the heavens, return.So the angels return every sky to their positions, so if they reach the sixth of the end, he tells them its inhabitants: Where are you?They will answer them like what they answered the people of the heavens, and the inhabitants of the Sadra of the ended are raised by their voices with praise, cheer and praise, so he hears the garden Aden and Faris, and hear the throne By praising, eliminating, and praise for the Lord of the two worlds, thanks to what this nation was given.And he says: I have forgiven you that you have forgiven the resting place for the reconciliation of the nation of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.And God says: Glory be to and Glory be to God, and the nation of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, has the honor of what I have not seen, nor the ears, he heard, nor heard.And in a narration on the authority of Kaab: We go to all the angels of the Sadra of the end with Gabriel, peace be upon them, and their number does not know except God, and that there is no exalted People only shook him.In a narration: He does not claim a believer or a believer except upon him, except for the fat of the wine and the eaters of the meat of the pingling and the joining of the savings, and if it is the sake اقْشِعْرارُ الجِلْدِ ورِقَّةُ القَلْبِ ودَمْعُ العَيْنَيْنِ.It was narrated in his descent with the angels, peace be upon them and his elderly with them other than that, and he mentioned some of that imam and otherwise.And we ask God Almighty to be healthy.And some of them mentioned that Gabriel, peace be upon him, will divide that night.A lot.So what I make?So God Almighty says: He divided the nation of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.He will be divided until they are used to seek them, and he says: O Lord, he remained from the mercy a lot.So what I make?So he says his rituals and the Almighty: He divided it on the infidels, and he will divide him from them, so whoever has something from them from that mercy died of faith.With the permission of their Lord, he is attached to a "descending" or by deletion is one of his actor; That is, they are affiliated with the permission of their Lord, that is, with his command, glory and glory, and the piety with that to glorify something that will bring them down.It was said: The indication is that they want in the people of the land of the believers and they miss them, so they will give permission, and they will give them permission for them, and in it, the numbers of the rituals are in the way.The matter of this desire is formed with the many sins, and it is answered that they are not standing on their conquest or did not consider them what is forbidden because they are not because they are from that They see it in the sky, or to hear the two repentant disobedience.In the Qudsi hadith: “Because where the sinners love me from the praise of the praise.” Or to gather with those between him and among them a suitable one from the two friends in order to perform the chair of love; For the souls of the righteous friends from the Abbasids of the eternity, the angels are still visited by peace in their position The angels, peace be upon them, are in their angles, and if that meeting is required with others who are not among them, it is a matter of one.For the sake of the eye, a thousand eyes are honored.From every matter, that is: For every matter, it is related to that of that Sunnah to a metaphor, and its chances appeared and exalted to them.It was said by one, and in the sense of the ill -fated lam, it is related to "it is revealed."
