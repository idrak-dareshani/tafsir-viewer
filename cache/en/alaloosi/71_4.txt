that is permissible for its increases, and it is divorced, and it is divorced, and it is not.Summary, that is, some of your sins are forgiven and selected.And he wrapped in some forgiven, and people went to the fact that the truth of God Almighty is the only one of the precedents on faith and others that they did not know before (P-70) (P-70) The faith is obligatory, and formed that glory, Ibn Abd al -Salam, in the widespread benefits, and he answered it, and he said: How is this correct on the opinion of it.Like the fear of its increase in the obligatory, but it says that it is to meet with the fact that Islam must be accepted by what he accepted in terms of nothing of it, and the answer is that the addition of the sins is the one While it was signed, when it did not happen, it is not a sin for them and added what was not located on the way of the crime, as in the conservation of your faith [Al -Maaidah: 89] if the one who is intended is the one who is the one who is intended for it.Tara is a truth and a hiatus that will be metaphor, so his afflictions collect between the truth and the metaphor in it while it is permissible.It means my companions, and it is what is meant by some of your sins, some who have ended, and he does not need the hadith of the gathering from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one And he is searching, and it is

leadership here and made him the son of the Al -Hajib, a pilgrimage to him and his response to some of the deadlines that the obligatory is from the part There is a contradiction between the obligatory and the obligatory, and the negligence of it is the one who is a sign of the Al -Tahdiyyah, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the midst of the righteousness, not in

methad It is for her to divorce her one and two and two and not be divorced when Abi Hanifa said, and they will be divorced three, if you want, because the word is a judge in the word of the word To

of the Tafizi, where he said: He commented on it to the Talwah, inferring on the fact that the member who is indicated by the sympathy is the opponent.For the whole, not the member who is better than

be upon him, and the speech of all of this nation, and no one went to the fact that the nipple does not contradict the whole of the whole, and the Sharaf was not corrected in his response to it, and he said: He stated that the inclusion is between them, where he said: And if it was also a speech for a single nation, then the forgiveness of some sins is not contradictory to the forgiveness The forgiveness of all of them is that the saying of the satisfaction is not necessary for what you knew that the stretching of the struggling is the stricken..And the saying of the grammarians or the discourse of the bone was subjected to the people of Noah, peace be upon him, and the speech of all of this nation is that the luxury is from the forgiveness of the one in the authority of the one who is in the authority Surah [Abraham: 10] invites you to forgive you from your sins and from it in Surah [Al -Ahqaf: 31] O our people, answer the call of God and believe in it, and they will be forgiven

disbelief without the believers in all (P-71) the Qur’an separating between the two speeches.He directed that the forgiveness came where it came in the discourse of the infidels The believers are exposed by obedience and avoiding from the tinkers and the like, so the abandonment is from the grievance, and it is exposed to the separation, but the separation is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a separation, The speech comes to the disbelief at the general public and it came as well as in Surah [Anfal: 38] Say to those

permissible for him to be intended for the time of the torment removed in his saying that he will come to him before they come to them with a painful torment, for it is a long time that is not for him, and it is not for him.It is delayed, and if God comes, if it comes, it will not be delayed as it is delusional, and the Zamakhshari in that is what he has obtained that the sake of the sake of

is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who will be The late delay is how it is perceived to be the imposition of his coming is the deadline that is the last of the deadlines, if you knew any of you You did not hurry, because I commanded you to do it, but you are not among his people in

the time of his constitution for appreciation and collection between my last and harmonious formulas of the significance of the concept of negation from (if) and made the knowledge of the knowledge of
