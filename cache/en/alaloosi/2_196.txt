The researcher, do the pilgrimage and Umrah for God, that is,: Make them complete if you are confronting their performances for the face of God - the highest In them, and he is compatible with him between Hanafi and Al -Shafi’i - may God be pleased with them - for the deeds of Hajj and Umrah are divorced, and the one who goes to the one who is in the past is required in the past, The origin of the original, and the saying of the meaning, based on the fact that the matter is to be divorced, the matter is required (P-79) to perform, because it is not decided that what is not fulfilled is the one who does not fulfill the obligatory Not something; Because the matter is necessary, it requires the maintenance of the hurricane, so the matter is to completely restricted with the honesty, and claim that the meaning comes to them, so that they are in the case.الشَّرائِطِ والأرْكانِ, وهَذا يَدُلُّ عَلى وُجُوبِهِما; Because the matter is back in it, and it is supported by the readings: (And they evaluate Hajj and Umrah) is not in the dirt; As for the first: because it is the disagreement of the phenomenon, and the ability of its acceptance in the place of the recipient, it is possible to make the repentance that benefits from the matter in which it is made - to the one - to the one - to the one - to the one - to the one - to the one - to the one - Not until the origin of the two, as in his saying - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -: “They welcomed whether both”; The duty and the delegate - I mean the request of the verb - and the presidency on that hadiths indicating the desirability of Umrah, so the Shafi’i was brought out in the mother and Abd al -Razza Bin Hamid and Ibn Majah, that he - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said: “The pilgrimage is a jihad and the Umrah is a volunt God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - on the authority of Umrah, is a duty?He said: “No, and that you are good for you,” and he supports that the son of Masoud, who is the owner of this read A woman and Umrah are a voluntary.God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - something that I said: Umrah is a duty like Hajj, and this indicates that he - may God be pleased with him For the royalty, because he has not heard anything in it, and perhaps he hears what he violate The matter in his readers on the blessed destiny that we said is not otherwise, based on the abuse of the purpose of the partner in its meanings, and the conquest of the gathering between the one The estimation of an agreed act for the remembrance that it is intended The scar, yes, is not considered what is mentioned, unless it is established before the verse, but if it is proven that it is after it, then it is not because it is necessary for it to be the same Dahir in the garment, and it is not beautiful in its suffering on the correctness, until the news is carried on the delay of the Bayan - on what is concerned About his appearance, but that is a dirt with a pleasure.Because the hadiths are a text in the fans, and the Qur’an is an apparent in the garment, so how is the appearance of the people of the text, and the situation is that the text is presented to the apparent.Then, this is the one who mentioned it - and if it is not invalidated for the origin of support, but it weakens it very much - and some of them claimed that the hadiths indicated by al -Umar It is indicated by its royalty from it, so the ruler was brought out of Zayd ibn Thabat, he said: The Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said: With any of them, you started, “and the father of David and the women broke out that a man said to Omar: I found the Hajj and Umrah, who are written on me.Your Prophet, “This indicates that the custody of the Prophet is the way of the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -; Because the recipient of what the companions have told of his Sunnah - peace and blessings be upon him - be a recipient of the actual hadith that was narrated by the companions, and the words of the companions, and the words of the companions, and the words of the companions, An interpretation of his saying: I found, so it is permissible for the obligatory to be the reason for the reason for them, so the hadith does not indicate the obligatory Because the sentence is a nose, as if it was said: What did you do?He said: I have been, so it indicates that the affliction is the reason for the opposite.Because the question of the questioner is the question about the validity of it, so how can he say: I found them.Because I have been blessed with them, it is correct for his knowledge of his knowledge with the authenticity of his affliction with them, and the answer of Omar - may God be pleased with him - is the Almighty - with the authority of God - with the authority of God - with the authority of God - Because the universe (P -80) in the thing is obligatory to complete it, it is not said that it is the way of the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - but it is said in the performance That is what happened in some of the narratives (the family of the family) with the fulfillment of the arrangement, and what was mentioned about the son of Masoud - may God be pleased with him - from the one who has been said With the beard, and on that he said to me - God honored the Almighty and his face - and he was reading: (And they were evaluated) as well as it was narrated by Ibn Jarir and others, and so on.He exalted them - ended, and fairness is to pass the news, and he took each of the imams with what was correct for him, and the question is from the righteousness, and the difference in the shame in the compassion.The truth is that the verse does not reconcile a sign of the philosophy and whoever agrees with them is like the imam on us, and there is no more than the right to be in it For their performance, and the guidance of people to your condemnation of what may be disobeyed from the synagogues that are created with that of the blockade and its part, from the end of their condition, from the case of the one who is the one who is the one who is in the case It is beneficial from his words of exalted: to God for the pilgrimage of the house, whoever is able to do a way to him and whoever claims from those who disagreed that he is a sign of him, so he has been stipulated and said that he did not.Whoever hears the hearing while he is a martyr, and the son of Jarir and Ibn al -Mundhir and al -Bayahqi and a group on the authority of Ali - the honored of God Almighty - to complete the pilgrimage and the age of the pilgrim Dura of your family, and the same is from Abu Hurairah, which is marrying to the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him God Almighty - from their completeness that each one of them is devoted to the other, and that it is perpetuated in the most famous pilgrimage, and it was said: Do you have to be the same Each of them is a travel, and it was said: to come out with a limit for them, not to leave and be like, and read: (to the house and the house), and the first is a narrator from the son God honored the Almighty -: If you are confined to the omitting; That is, this is if you are able to complete them, the blockade and the confinement, both of them are in the origin of the language in the sense of the prohibition in divorce, and the confinement is not concluded with what is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is And the fear - as the gospel is illuminated - from the large number of their sins, as well, for it may rise to the expansion of the excess of the general meaning of the general meaning in some It is said: the enemy confined it and its confusion is as opposed to it, and if the relative was to the enemy, it was considered in the concept of the confusion, it would be the permissibility, and it was the time of the time.The relative to the disease and its surname is considered in the concept of the blockade, if its support for the enemy was metaphor, and both of them are the disagreement of the origin, and what is meant by the blockade is here And Al -Shafi’i - may God have mercy on them - for His Excellency: If you believe, then the security is a language in the metaphor of fear and for its descent in the year The exalted on them - the restriction of the enemy is not limited, and it restricts the release of the verse, and it is known by the occurrence of download.Imam Abu Hanifa went to the fact that what is meant by what is prevented from an enemy and illness and others, and the father of David was brought out to and the one who was good Al -Hijj ibn Amr: “Whoever breaks or is a wrapping, so the pilgrimage to him is a metaphor.” Al -Tahawi narrated from the hadith of Abd al -Rahman ibn Zayd.He said: A man is a man Umrah, Omar Bin Said is said to him: He can seek, and he is a ritual in the way; If a kneeling came upon him, the son of Masoud, and they asked him and said: “Send the guidance, and make between you and between him the day Abu Shaiba on the authority of Ata: “There is no blockade except from the illness, an enemy, or an afflicted matter.And what is inferred by the opponent is a response from it, but the first is to know what is in it, and the second is that it is not a lesson with the privacy of the causes, and the bearer is that it is for the sake of it.With an arrest, and saying that you are limited to a year; As the proven verb is not general, it is only wanted by what is mentioned in it, and it is the love of the enemy with agreement, which is not something; Because, even if it is not a year, but it is divorced, then it will run on its release, and the third is because it is after the argument of the authority of the saying He exalted him - in the proverbs of that opposed to what Ibn Jarir and Ibn Al -Mundhir came out from him in the interpretation of the verse, that he said: He says: “Whoever is forbidden by Hajj, With a sickness that he strives or an enemy that he loves, he has a sacrifice of what he is facilitated by the guidance.And the saying - that the hadith of Al -Hijj is weak - weak; As he has a different way in the Sunnah, and Abu David narrated that Akrama asked the Abbas The prohibited stipulated that the displays of the municipality from the disease has the time of the intention; For his saying - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - for Habbah: From the release of the release, the release is the release and the referee in the judgment, and the referee is the ruling, and the ruling is in it.That is, do you, or the obligatory Therefore, it is called the individual and the collection, or the collection of guidance (as a grandfather and a grandfather), and reads: (guidance) with tension, the gathering of guidance (as a maid) Among the reluctant guarantors, and the meaning is that the forbidden if he is confined and wanted to be analyzed, analyzed with a sacrifice of guidance that is easy for him from a body, or a bid, or a mortal, or a mortar May God be pleased with him - and he is more likely.No, and it is sacrificed as I am confined to the most.May God’s prayers and peace be upon him - the sacrifice of the year of Hadaybiyyah with it and it is from the solution, and when we send someone who is confined to it and makes the mortar of the Lord, then the mother of God came to him.He thinks that he was slaughtered, and you will be exalted.By shortening the proportions of the women, and the discourse of the confined; Because it is the closest of the male, and the second guidance is the first eye as it is the phenomenon; That is: Do not be resolved until you know that the guided guidance to the forbidden is to reach its place, which must be forbidden in it, and it is the forbidden to say it to the Almighty: then the place of the place.He was guided by the kaaba and what was narrated from his sacrifice - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - in the Hadaybiyyah, a Muslim, but he was the slaughter of the solution, and it is not a Muslim, The restriction of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - was in the way of the Hadbiyyah lower Mecca, and the Hadaybiyyah is connected to the forbidden, and the slaughter in the The Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - descended - and with him he is collected among what your money said and between what Al -Zuhri narrated, “The Messenger of God - may God bless him And the narration of it is not proven in the matter of prevention, and the first was pregnant with the justification He does not need the ability of science as in the past, and he is inferred by his confidence in the guidance in the place of the Bayan on the numbness of the jurisdiction God Almighty - and his companions of the Umrah of the Hadaybiyyah who were in line with it, and it was called the Umrah of the judiciary, and the place is the place of the way of the way of the way Bayan everything that is obligatory for him, and he did not know from the ruling other than the one who is exclusive, as he knew the ruling of the limit from the absence of the solution to it.With the text of the text, and the speech was made in general for the confined and otherwise based on kindness and do not shave it on his saying of his grace: and they did not come to me, so that it is not.Because if you believe a kindness on, then you are confused as it is not hidden, (and the place) by breaking from the limit Its solutions and the sake of his sake.Whoever is a sick one of you needs a throat, and he is specific to his saying of his grace: and do not get a separation from it.(P-82) or has a harm from his head of surgery, lime, and headache, and a ransom, that is, it has a ransom if he is stuck.From fasting, charity, or human beings to the Sans of Fadiya, and its ability has been brought out in the injustice.The Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - passed by him and he was in the same way before he entered Mecca while he was forbidden while he is under the authority “Do you harm you?” He said: Yes, he said: “So shake your head, and feed a difference between six holders - and the difference is three is more beautiful - or the fast of three days or the people of God.” And Muslim and the Women and the son of Majah and Al -Tarmahi, “The Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said to him:“ I did not see that the effort is with you.” And he said: No, he said: “Deaf three days or feed six holders, for every holder, half of a food is a food, and your head is shaved.” For each of the poor, and the place of the ransom did not indicate, and the general public is in all the positions as the son of the horse, and it is the imam of the imam.Security is his demise, so on the first one, then if you are in a capacity and a capacity and you will not be disobedient, and on the second: if it is removed from you, the fear of the blockade, and the one who is the one who is a loyalty, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a loyal With the way of connotation, and the fulfillment of compassion for the help of you, the benefit of the punishment, whether I want to limit the enemy or every prevention in the existence, and it is said to the one who is satisfied, and it is said to the one who is sick.Security, as it was narrated from Ibn Mas'oud and Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - from the way of Abraham, so he weakens the reference of the Shafi’i.So whoever enjoys the urbanization to the pilgrimage, the fulfillment is located in the answer (if) (and the B) (and to) Before the pilgrimage in the pilgrimage in its most famous, and it was said: The Bajah is a captive and the enjoyment is attached to the enjoyment.With his awareness, and the meaning: whoever enjoys the time of Umrah and the analysis of them with permissibility of prohibitions of warning until he is forbidden by Hajj, and in which the way is from the one who is the authority The linguist, and the second is the integral integrity, and the first is to be deprived of the Umrah in the most famous pilgrimage and comes with its sweeteners, then it is deprived of the pilgrimage, and it is forbidden.And the Qur’an is met, which is to be deprived of them with them, and he will come with the pilgrims, so he enters into it your life and individuals, which is to be forbidden by the pilgrimage.He is a pleasure in the guidance of the guidance, so that it is a blood.When he deprived, not from the meeqaat, this is inherited through it, so he was forced with this blood, and then it is not obligatory for the angel and whoever is in his ruling, and sacrificed it if He prohibited the pilgrimage, and it is not permissible before the warning, and the day of the sacrifice is not appointed to him, but he is disturbed and does not eat from it, and this is the way of the Shafi’i, and the imam went to the father Kids Al -Qarin; Because it is a matter of a thankful gathering among the people, so it is like the sacrifice, and the day of the day is sacrificed, so whoever does not find any: the guidance, and it is the guidance.Fasting three days in the pilgrimage, meaning: it has fasting, and reading: (fasting) with the setting; That is, let him finish, and the fasting of fasting is deleted; It is not possible that something of the pilgrimage is a kind of pilgrimage to him, so Abu Hanifa said: What is meant in the time of the pilgrimage is divorced, but among the two warrants, the forbidden of the pilgrim, the pilgrim, the pilgrim, The rest of the solution from them, so it is included if it was signed before the pilgrimage, whether it is dissolved from the life or not, and what happened after it with the evidence that it is the one who is the one who is the one who has the same Decisiveness, and it is obligatory, and if it is destined (P-83), after the solution, it is not obligatory for it to mark the intention of the fast, and it is the fast, and he said: The pilgrimage, which is the days of being preoccupied with it after the warning and before the solution, and the fast is not permissible for him before the pilgrimage, and the love is to fast, and the one who has the argument and the argument.Because it is the end of what can be delayed to enforce the ability at the original, which is the guidance, and the day of the day and the days of the echoes is not permissible to make the fast in it.The last three are involved in what was brought out by Ibn Jarir, Al -Daraqni and Al -Bayahqi from Ibn Omar, he said: The guidance, and he did not fast until he missed the days of the ten days to fast the days of honor, and it was brought out of your money from Al -Zuhri, who said: “He sent the Messenger of God - may God bless him God ibn Hudhafah, so he called in the days of the honor, so he said: “These are the days of eaters, drinking, and the remembrance of God - the Almighty - except for those who have a fast from Hadi” The same is from the way of Said ibn al -Musayyib, and the outskirts of Bukhari and the group “on the authority of Aisha - may God be pleased with him - said: I have not been permitted - peace be upon him - peace be upon him - peace be upon him Exclusive to silence except for a enjoyment that did not find guidance, “And that the Imam took your money, and perhaps our Hanafi Saddam On the day of the sacrifice, it is not rewarded except blood, and it is not spent after the days of the tribute, as it went to the Shafi’i; Because it is a substitute, and the substitution is only a law, and the text summarized by the pilgrimage, and the permissibility of blood on the original; And on the authority of Omar - may God be pleased with him - that he commanded him to be the sacrifice of the sheep.And seven if you returned, i.E., you emptied and repelled his business, So the return is mentioned and I want his reason, or the meaning, if you return from me, and Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him - on what is correct for you, if you are more And the Al -Bukhari brought him out from Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with him -: The ruling of the return to his homeland; Because the law established the position of residence in the place of the stomach, (and in the sea) that is intended to repent to the terrible people in it - when some - and the emptiness - and the void - The words are tattooing, and he carried in the sense after the bearing on its memorization in its individuals and its absence, and read: (seven) with the installation, kindness on the authority of (three days); Because it is an effective effective, and whoever is not permissible (and fast) and the father of Hayyan.That is a full ten signal to (three and seven) and the distinction of the number is deleted; That is, days, and the (Taa) in the number with the delicacy of the distinguished, the best of the recipients, and the benefit of the frustration is that it is not deluded that the (waw) is meaningful, or the meaning of the Al -Serafi in the explanation of the book on its coming to that, and the optimum matter is presented as a condition in it, but the news that is in the sense of the matter is like that, and if it is the same We have referred to him at the forefront of the miracle of the Qur’an, and that the number is known as a sentence - as it is known in detail - and he is surrounded by two sides, so the knowledge of the knowledge is made Knowledge), not in particular, and the most Arab does not improve the account, for the one who is the general discourse whom he understands with his own and the general public who are among the people With the recklessness of the words and the increase in understanding, and the indication that the one is (seven) are the number without the many, for it is used by these two meanings, and the one who says: Until it needs its calling separation for what it is mentioned?It is answered that it was instead of (the guidance) and the extension is in the place of the predecessor from it, so the three are made by the time of the pilgrimage, and it is more than the one in the pilgrimage.To be equivalent to it without a deficiency in the reward; Because the ransom is based on the facilitation, (P-84) and it did not make (the seven) in it for the hardship of fasting in the pilgrimage, and for the sign of this equivalent (the equivalent) Full, as it was said: That is a full ten in its fall, instead of the guidance, and it was said: It is a confirmed adjective that benefits the increase in the increase in its fasting, and that it does not, Its number, as if it was said that is a whole tenth, so they are like her and not cut it, and it was said: It is a clear adjective as the tenth of the tenth, for it is a number of fullness in it, The start of the number, and the first [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
