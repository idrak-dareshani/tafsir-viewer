The researcher, when his Lord, was afflicted with the words of a comment (as) are the prohibitions of the signal that the sign is presented in the view of the verse, and the choice of Abu Hayyan, who commented on it, A delayed, that is, it was Kit and Kit, and the famous attach to it with an introduction provided that its estimation is: remember, or remember the same time, and the sentence is not so.The story is composed of the story, and the union in the intention is, for the intended one of their remembrance and their fear of being brought up to the acceptance of the debt of the debt The fanaticism, and the love of Al -Raysah, as well as the intention of the story of Abraham, peace be upon him, and the explanation of his refusal to pray to the religion of Islam, and the leaving of the fanatic He knew that he had obtained the imam with the leadership of his ruling, and that he did not respond to his supplication in the oppressors, and that the kaaba was a circumstance and a worshiper in his time.He used to perform the house, as he was angry, as he is in the religion of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and that our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is from his prayers, and that he is called in his right With the religion of Islam, it was the duty of those who are aware of his preference, and that he is from his children, and he used to follow his mill, and he is shown to be from his watery Like that, and the Issam of the Mourning and Religion went to the permissibility of kindness on (my blessing), that is, remember the time of Abraham, for it is what is good for you Your fathers are your intercessors on the day of resurrection, because he did not accept the supplication of Abraham in the injustice, and the love of the ritual rituals will be deposited from you.He knows from him that he does not attain the unjust, and it is assumed that he is a bit of rhetoric with the necessity Those who are given, and the consequences of the original, as we provide (P-374), and what is meant by it is the cost, or the treatment is the treatment of the perfection, as it is the right of the admiration, as the truth The exalted, to be a world of secret and hidden things, (and Abraheim) is a cosmopolitan, which was said: it is before the transmission, a merciful father, and it is an effective effective to the addition of it to the addition.And exposure to the title of the grapes of the peace of peace be upon him, and that it is that this is a rabbit and a nomination of a dangerous matter, (and the word) (and the word) Its uniformity, and it is used in the useful sentences, and it is called the suffering of that, because of what is between the memorial and the meaning of the intensity Abbasid, may God be pleased with them: it is the ten who is from the breakfast: the shed, the inhalation, the storytelling of the mustache, the exemption of the beard, the difference, and the difference, Grandfism, and stump, And the length, and the two of the two, and he said that it is also a narration from it: No one was afflicted with this religion, so all of it was established except for the premature, God bless him with the thirty From it in Surah Al -Baraa (Al -Taboun), etc., ten in the parties: the Muslims and Muslims, etc.They are kept in the narration of the ruler in its relicle: that it is thirty, and the first three lights are considered, and the last surah is not the last, for which in the righteousness, the ritual, and the rituals, And kneeling, prostrating, and commanding the well -known, and forbidding the denial, and the preservation of the limits of God Almighty, and the faith that is beneficial from and the good of the believers, or from the believers, or from the believers, or from the one who is the one who is the believers, or from the believers, or from the believers, or from the believers, or from the people of the believers, or from those Islam, faith, channels, honesty, patience, roughness, belief, fasting, memorization of the ears, male, and who are in the believers: faith, righteousness, and symptoms, and symptoms, symptoms, Zakat, and the memorization of the elders except for the husbands or slaves, three, and the sponsorship of the covenant, and the trustworthy two, and the preservation of the prayer, and this is a building on the one The qualities after the collection of the tushes are mentioned, such as faith and memorization for the outsiders, as it does not contradict the three of them, but it contradicts its seduction of itself, and from here, the one is the same and three of us.Ten, verse of Al -Shafi’i, by administering its release in every surah, and in the narration of Akrama, based on the advertisement of the seizure of the self, and the ritual of the ritual The evil for the believers is in the righteousness, and made the permanence on the prayer and the preservation of it one, and those who are in their nations are a right to be known to the liquids and the warehous For its comprehension of the virginity, the link of the relatives, and what was narrated that it is four, and it was shown in what is in the fourth light built on the first of the first, and it is not, so it is not, and it is not.God is the highest of the seven things with the makers, the moon, the betrayal of the oldest, the fire, the sacrifice of the boy, and the migration from Kutti to the Levant, and the narration of that of the good After the imamate, purify the house, and raise its barriers, Islam, and it was said, to three ten sayings, and the son of Amer, and the son of Zubar, read Bakra (Abraham) by breaking the distraction and deleted the ya, and the son of Abbas, Abu al -Sha’ath, and Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with them, read from them with a lifetime ( In the sense of admission, a truth is to be healthy from the servant, and the intention is called his Lord with words like the Lord of my Lord, how to live the death, and make this country to this country Carrying over the metaphor, but what was said: It is true of the servant, it is not valid or does not improve his attachment to the Lord, So, it is not an apparent, only a remembrance of the word, and it is permissible for that to be in the place of mankind and the shrine of the immortality is not hidden, so they will give it to me There is no other, and the reluctant is the one who can return to Abraham, and to return to his Lord, on each of the readings of lifting and share, so we are the first of the first: On (Abraham), it is erected, and in the sense that I care about, then he came to them on the face of the full face, and performed it (P-375) as he met.Then: He is pleased with them, and he strengthened them on their completeness, or I have their wages for him, or their longing is a year in it and in his height to the day of the day (Abraham) Marifa, and the meaning is upon him: I have the honor of the words that are called by that he sponsored the conditions of answering in it, and he did not come after what he is in the way of it, It is erected, and the meaning is upon him, so he gave his grace (Abraham) all of what he called, and the first and the most luxurious norms appear, as the praise is not the same as what is in the second One of its requirements, and the dawn, is not followed in the third, because the verb that falls in the metaphor of the admiration must be the verb of the one He said that I made you an imam, an imam, a bayyan exile, if I guaranteed a bound, as it was said: What was after?So I answered that, or a bayyan to get it, based on my opinion of those who made the words with the phrase of what he mentioned, and some of them make that from the part of the whole, And if it is erected when he said, as the father of Hayyan went to him, the group will be a sentence that is given to what he accepted on the face, which passed, It is an expulsion to make the saying of the Almighty: Or were you a testimony if he made a speech to Jews, his signing, and his saying is his saying: They said: In the sense of the one who transgresses to the two of the two, and the second is either related to making any for their sake, or in the position of the situation, because it is a disgrace, that is, the imam, the imam, the imam, the imam, the imam, the imam, that is, the imam, A name for the one who is entrusted with it, and from it was said to the construction of the construction: an imam, and it is an effective one, and he made it a name for it, because it is the same as the one who is a good one The imam is what is concerned with it, and the visit is what it is destroyed, for they are the effective and the verb of the verb is not a machine, because it is the middle between the actor and the verb in the verb, The active is a family, so the perpetrator was like that, and it is not, and it is not a whole name of the name of a mother who leads as a hungry, a hungry, a standing, and a resurrection, and it is with the right, For the Prophet and the Caliphate, and the Imam of the Prayer, but everyone who believes in it in anything, and if it is void as he indicates to him the saying of the Almighty: He made them imams They call for the fire, except that what is meant by here is the Prophet who is in the past, for whoever promises him to be the mother of the Prophet is not his imam, and his imam is like him As it is required to lend people, and the form of the name of the actor indicating the recipient, and the coming of the prophet is not harmful after him, because he did not send a prophet except for him By following him in the sentence, not in all judgments, for the sake of the company that is after him in all, so his imam will be the rest of the imam It is based on the fact that what was copied, even if it is not said to him, is not an elderly His mother who followed him, and you are to commit to the saying of the imamate of every Prophet, but in the dominance of al -Tawahid, and it was not copy His saying refers to him: Those who are the guidance of God, and they guided them, and the rest of the Shiwa is not a Muslim, and if he does not harm, and the peace be upon him This is without otherwise for a special that required that, you hardly hide, and it is planned.Then it is not hidden that the appearance of the verse indicates that the abuse was before the prophecy, because it is the Almighty to make those words to make it an imam, and it was said: It requires the preservation of the one, and it is answered that the divorce of the revelation does not have to be the resurrection to the creation, and you know that the slaughter of the child, the rituals, and the fire, if it was from it The matter, because this was after the prophecy, without suspicions, and so is the betrayal also based on what was narrated that he was praying and peace, when he was a good time So, it needs to be the fulfillment of the words because the imam is to adopt its generals to people, and to admire his prayers in the right This is what is meant by his words of exalted: So they are careful that he was groaning and the Almighty is aware of his condition that he (P-376) will fulfill them, and he will do so, and he will not be.The imam and the prophecy, and it is not hidden that the fulfillment refuses to be pregnant with this meaning.(He said) Biany, and the guarantee of his Abraham, peace be upon him, (and from my offspring) is a kindness on the cave, it is said: I will be honored, and you will say: Be from my offspring?Away, and Abu Hayyan went to the fact that he is attached to a deletion, and does he make from my atoms an imam, because he is peace be upon him, so he understood that I am making you a brother, And assume what was presented that the neighbor and the bitter do not reconcile with it, so how is it over to him, and that kindness is on the one who is the same, how is it possible.It is the one who is said Another saying, and the first was driven by the fact that the overwhelming addition is in the ability of separation, and from my offspring in the sense of some of my offspring, as if he said: He said: On the authority of the bid, the bid of the neighbor of the neighbor, and that his father is the most grammar Al -Aabab: It is a response in the seventy -seven readings, so whoever responds to that, he has responded to the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.It is a news in the sense of students, and as if its origin is: and made some of my offspring, as the one who was supposed to be destroyed, but it was amended from it to the one who is from the one who is from it.The words of the speaker, as if it is a right, like the one who is given to him, made himself like a deputy from the speaker, and the enemy of the one who is the one who is the same And taking into account the literature in avoiding the image of the matter, and in it from the briefed, the signed is what is eager to every view, and the counterpart of this kindness is what the Sheikh narrated from the authority of the son On the authority of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, he said: “(O God, the Most Merciful of the Places.And the shorters, O Messenger of God, said: And the shorters).The fundamentalists mentioned that the recitation was returned and changed it from the forefathers, and that it was signed in the condemnation as in the hadith: “(God is the Height of the Heat of the Harr The Messenger of God), “It was also assumed that the remembrance of the remembrance is claimed that the imam of his offspring is general for all the people of the Imam of the Imam of the Imam, and what is the imam of it Likewise, and it is answered that it is sufficient in the compassion of the like in the origin of the meaning, and it was said: It is sufficient for its acceptance in the right of our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, The young, then the one and the single children, and others, were said, and it was said: It includes the fathers, because the Almighty said: We carried their offspring in the darkness, and the wickedness of it, Its disagreement, and there are three languages, the annexation, their opening, and their brokenness, and it is a reciter, and it is either an action from the atoms or the atom, and the origin is the atom, or the atomic, and the first And the origin of the original J.Falas, an offspring, or a verb of them, and the origin in the first is an offspring, so the waw fell, so that the precedent of the offspring is like the second, so it was in the same way.He is an offspring, or a verb from the atom in the sense of creation, and the origin is an offspring, so the ham A verb of the atom in the sense of separation, and the origin of the offspring of the ritual railway, J, a sagging from the weight of the deception, as they said, I think you think, and I think you think, I spent, or a verb from it, and the origin is the atom, so the last Arabs fell, so the slurring came, or the act of it in the form of the lineage, they said: Its coming as a liberty, dignity, and its inclusion to the release, but it was included because the sons may be changed in the proportions in particular, as they said in the lineage.(He said) Al-Nafi'i is also a bayyan, and the guarantee of God is the best of his name, and he does not obtain the covenant of the unjust, an answer for what (P-377) is the one who took the literature in his request from the one who made it to make it.He was made with the eyes of the bush of some, which was inspired in his prayers, peace be upon him, by informing and affirming him, as he denied the ruling on one of the ruling We deny it, to be an indication of the evidence for the other, so what is repeated from the era of the imam, and that it is not here except the prophecy, and express it to it, to it to it, to it to it, to it to it.And his covenant, which he does not do except for those who will God Almighty from His worshipers, and the effect of the coming on the eelness is a gesture until the imam of the Prophet is one of his offspring, for the sake It is independent, but it is a woman in the face of his imam, each of them attains his estimated time for him, and he does not return from that shortening in the arrangement of the Prophet of the Prophet of God And he greeted, because he is a course of abstraction that, if that if he would be broken from her destiny, when he was blessed, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, he said: Abraham and those who are disbelieved from the unbelieving injustice, because it is the perfect individual of his individuals, and his words are supported by the Almighty: and the disbelievers are the unjust, so it is not in the verse in the verse Peace be upon them from the cabinet before the mission, nor that the evildoer does not reconcile for the disagreement, in which we have seized the disbelief of the disbelief who were the ones who were coming.Their hopes are empty of its nullity, and some Shiites inferred from the denial of the Imamate of the Siddiq and his companions, may God be pleased with them A great injustice and the shadow with the text of the verse is not attained by the imam, and it is answered that the absence of what is required is that the oppressor in the case of injustice does not obtain it, and the imam is that they are satisfied with them Like their faith, and the end of their equivalent, and it was assumed that (from) a whiteness, the question of Abraham, peace be upon him, is the imam, either for the one who is the same The unjust is the state of the imam, whether it was fair in the rest of the age or not, or the one who is in some unjust in some other, or the blessings, for the first, the first of the answer is obligatory The second is the ignorance of the succession and its entourage, and on the third one and its life, and on the four, either the one who is required, or corruption, and you are an expert that the building of the one is the one The prophecy and the imam that they call, and without its proof the excess of the murder, and the permissibility of some as the platform is not based on the commitment of all, and on the destruction of the ritual of the ritual The question of the imam in the meaning of the meaning of the vague one is not to bring the equity in terms, and the darkness is the case of the question, and the verse is a answer to its supplications with the increase of it, and it is not for us.The first slit, but the increase in it is an increase in it, and the answer can be made by choosing the third slit as well, by saying: It is on two sections, one of them is the one who is the one who is the imam and the imam is the one who is the imam With the time, it is divided, rejoicing that it became a repentant of the precedent grievance, so the state of the imam is described by the divorced and the second, and the second is the one who will be And he is distinguished from the darkness, but it is not described by the absolute justice for the duration Paragraph from the corruption that is the one who is required to obtain it, for the answer is the exile of the imamate of this division, and the sheikh and the murmur of God, may God be pleased with them.The paths of the first section are described by the sincere repentance, the absolute mode, and the established faith, and the imam must be the time of the imam as well And it is not true that it is called a disbeliever or an unjust in a language, a kfar, and a legitimate, as it was decided in the origins that the one who was derived from the beginning, It is not a metaphor, and the metaphor is also not mentioned, but where it is compatible, otherwise it is a boy of the sheikh, and the sleep of the waked down, and the rich of the one, and the richness of the And a living, and in the opposite, and also if he had been repeated, he is obligated from a solution that does not surrender to a disbeliever, so he greeted a believer in the case, except that he was unbelieving.It is a result of being rested, nor did he say about it, and from our companions who made the verse an indication of the infallibility of the prophets from the cabin Carrying the era on the imam and making it completely, and making it a shame for the prophecy, and the disagreement, and carry the unjust to the one who committed a disobedient disobedience to the one who has been picked up (p-378) The injustice is the disagreement of justice, and the face of the recipient is then that the verse indicated that the coming of the imamate does not collect the precedent injustice, so if it is fulfilled in the nick Their liability is the case of the next darkness, and that is either by not issuing from them what is required of that, or with his loudspeakers after his arrival, with the ritual, and he said: That the biggest breasts of the oldest, is it permissible before the mission or not, so the second is the one who is the infallibility, or what is meant by it is here the breasts of the sin, not the king In the dark as in the evildoer, the knowledge of the imam after the imam after it is made, and it is beneficial to the imamate of the imam of the imam on the authority of the imam, from what is decided The connotation of the text, or the measuring in the way to the saying of equality, and no less, or a comprehensive commitment and they are the restrictions The lamb over the whole, and the phenomenon was that the oppressive darkness and the pure immorality prevent the imamate with a meeting, as it is forbidden to appeal, because the contradiction is between the two description The time, and with it, some of the predecessors said, except that the gathering is on its dispute, claiming that the contradiction in the appetite does not require the contradiction in the survival, because the payment is more For him, if he said to a woman who is unaware of the proportions, he gives birth to his example: this is my daughter, it is not permissible for him to marry her, and if he said, he said to him The marriage did not rise, but if the judge is separated from him, the judge separated them, and this who said it is only a hand over if the injustice does not reach the limit of the disbeliever, then the disbeliever is, then the disbelief is, Also, without a doubt, and the caliph is removed from it, and from the people who inferred from the verse on that if the unjust, if they are bored, he will not be obligated to the one who is obligatory On the authority of Al -Hasan, he said: God Almighty did not make the unjust as a covenant, and he is as he sees, and the father of hope and mourning read, and the stomachs (the unjust) (the unjust) Introduction to the actor, as a promise and care for the communication,
