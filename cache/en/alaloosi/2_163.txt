The researcher, the God of your God, is one of the Gods: He descended as it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, when the disbelievers of Quraysh said to the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -: And the speech is general to everyone who is correct to address as it is the back of it, unable to be overwhelmed by the descent, and the sentence is given to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who conceals the story of the story, And it is all that the first is a market to prove his prophethood - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and this is to prove his body - the Almighty - and it was said: Their mine of what they treat their messengers to their milestones from their treatment of their Lord; Where they conceal his body, and say: Izzar and Jesus are a son of God - glory and exalted - and in it that, even if it is good for the system, except that it is in it.- And the addition of (God) to the guarantee of those who address the adoption of the investigator, not by adopting the fall, because the gods are not the most worthy, and the return of (P -30) (P -30) (P -30)) With the only one to benefit that the one who is the one who is the one in the faces, and the fulfillment of worship, and if not for that, it is enough for you, and it is one of it, then it is a house and the one who is the same One scientist.And Abu al -Baqah said: (God) is the news of the beginning, and (one) is a row for him, and the abuse here is the adjective; If he said: And your god is one, it was the intended, except that in his remembrance is a more affirmation, and this is like the situation that is slow, as I said: In the news: a good person is a good person, and perhaps the first is kind, and more people are on the fact that the one is here in a sense that we do not look for him or his youth in himself, nor in his attributes, or in his attributes, or in his attributes, or in his attributes, or in his adjectives It does not have a sense of light, and it is not permissible for him to divide, and he does not take part in the first place, and the meaning of it is not here the principle of the number, and the most correct of the words is that He who has no counterpart or his youth has in the investigation of worship, and he is obligated to every father of a father in which there is a lower, silent and eternal.There is no god but it is: a second news of the start or another attribute to the news or a subjugated sentence that has no place in the Arabization, and on any estimated, it is a decision of the two On what was said - when he may be deluded that there is a god, but he is not worthy of worship, and the guarantor who is saheeh is valid, with the exaltation of the one who is the one who is in the authority of the It is a permemable allowance from a light, and he was disagreed with the exile: Is the idol right or the idol in falsehood, so Muhammad al -Shaeseni said: The slave is invalid, downloading the house of the number, and Abdullah al -Habti said: Rather, the gods of the worshipers are touched, and for all, and for all of you The right with the second; Because the idol is invalid, it has a presence in the outside, And it is provided in the believer in the description of his being false, and it is provided in the infidel of the infidel by the same as it is true, so it is from where it is in the absence of it.Because the self is not exiled, and so on where it is idol in a false invalidity that is also not exiled; As it is a slave of the falsehood of a true matter that is not valid for its negation, otherwise it is a lie, but it is exiled from where its existence is in the infidel of the infidel from the one who is in the same way.It is a right idol, so the slaves of falsehood were not implemented except from where they are in truth, and it was not implemented in this word.Hope - I understand, and you will come to realize what is in this good word in his place - if God wills Almighty -.The Most Merciful 163: Two others after the news of the news or the news of its saying: (Your God) or for the beginning of a deleted, and the sentence is a bidder, or a bond, or a bond, or a bond, With them, to distinguish the self -affiliated with the same, as it is, and the answer will be an agreement to what they asked, and therefore reference to the pilgrimage of the Haddani; Because when all of the blessings of all were the origins and a minimum and the last, and what it has either is either the best is pure or the best of the majority, and it is either a blessing or the blessing of it.However, it is to contain all in the need to need it - the exalted - in the existence, and what it follows from the mission.
