The researcher is the one who lends to God (who) is an intercession of the transcendent of the place, and (who) is his news, and (who) is a description of him, or a replacement of it, and he does not have any.One name; Like: What is it, what is the same, as the father stipulated that the father stipulates; Because (what) is more important than (who), and the lending of God is an example to present the urgent work; Request for the later reward, and what is meant is: either jihad that is densely disgraced to the soul and money, or the divorced work of good deeds, and in which there is an entry into it, the first of all The two estimates do not hide the sentence of the sentence of what is before it is a loan either a source in the sense of lending, so it will be a stake on the source, or with the meaning Al -Maafaliya, and his saying of his grace: a good description of it on the two of the two, and the face of goodness on the first of the first, for example, and on the second, the solution and the good, Omar ibn al -Khattab _ may God be pleased with him _ the good loan: the stigmatization and the agreement in the path of God Almighty, and on it the accommodation of the arrogance, the healing of it And make him double metaphor; Because it is the reason for the double, and the permissibility of added estimation; That is: his reward is doubled, and the form of the reaction is not at its door, as it is not a shame, but it was chosen for the shiring language to it, and it was read, and he reads, and he reads One of them: to be a shift on a source that lends to the meaning; That is, whoever is a loan from which he is a double from God, the Exalted, and secondly: that there is an answer to an interrogation, also; Because the concept (P-163) is about it, even if the lended is in the memorizer; However, it is in the sense of lending, as if it was said: God is the most exalted, and he will be multiplied, and this is what the father of the survival chose, and it was not permissible for the answer to be the answer.Because the one who is accused of it is in which the lender is not the loan, and it does not have his kindness to the source who is (a loan), as the verb is overwhelmed by the source of the addition of; For two things, it was said; The first: that a loan here is an affirmative source, and it is not estimated by the fact that the verb, and the second: that its kindness is upon him, it is necessary for it to be a work of this (it is valid), and it is not valid, Because the doubles are not attributed, but it is a verb of God Almighty, and in which there is a contemplation, and Ibn Katheer read: He weakens him with raising, and the one who is more It weakens it with the installation, weakening the total number of things, and it is the same as the thing in the prohibition if it is added to it, so it is not a source, and the source of the oscillator or the use of this is the use of this, and the weakening is, or the use of this is the use of this.It will be a state of distraction in (it is doubled), and that it will be a second effective in the sense that the doubles are included in the sense of the formation, and it is permissible to be considered a source of the location, So he erects the source at that time, but rather gathered and the sources are neither bent nor gathered; Because it is a stimulus of the truth in terms of the intent of the different types, and what is meant by it also, then that is the truth, but it is intended from the one where it is in the way Under it, many people do not know except God, the Exalted, and the Imam was brought out by Ahmad, and the son of the alert, and the son of Abu Hatim, on the authority of Abu Uthaman al -Nahdi, who said: “God Almighty will write to His servant who believes in the same goodness, a thousand thousand goodness, so I did not do so, and I did not want to do this I was done by Abu Hurairah, and I said to him, and he said: This is not this, and he did not preserve the one who talked to you, but I said: God Almighty will give the servant to the one Well, then Abu Hurairah said: Or do you find this in the book of God Almighty: Who is the one who lends to God with a good loan, then he will be lost to him, so he will make him a lot of people.More than a thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand, and whose souls are in his hand, I have heard the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him _ he said: He says: God is the best of God Well, “And God will hold and simplify, that is: it is seized on one, and it is expanded by one, or it is stated by Tara, and it will be expanded by the time of the time.Its secret has been knocked, and its destiny has exalted, and if you knew that it is the hand and the mediator, and that what is with you is from its simplicity and its giving; So do not break it on it, so lend it and spend what expanded you with the way it expanded and gave it, and do not reflect that you will be in the way of you Reflection, that he will be held and he will be seen after what he expanded, and I appreciate you on spending, and for a murder, deaf, and dagge It is on it, so the words are like confirmation and registration for what he accepted, and the delay of the simplicity is on the other Reading to the poor, and reading: it is a place and it is returned and you will be rewarded for what you came.* * * And from the sign of the sign that the prayers are five; The prayer of the secret with its testimonies is the place of the unseen, and the prayer of the soul is with its darkest from the reasons of the Lord, and the heart of the heart with its monitors is the lights of the revelation, and the prayer بِحِفْظِ الحَواسِّ وإقامَةِ الحُدُودِ, فالمَعْنى: حافِظُوا عَلى هَذِهِ الصَّلَواتِ الخَمْسِ, والصَّلاةِ الوُسْطى الَّتِي هي صَلاةُ القَلْبِ الَّتِي شَرْطُها الطَّهارَةُ عَنِ المَيْلِ إلى السِّوى, وحَقِيقَتُها Touring to the load; And for this, it is invalidated by the dangers and the warning of the same as the game of the self and set up to God to go to Him.That is: it is obedient to him, back and inner; By paying the malays, then if you fear the shocks of the majesty if you travel to God Almighty; So they separated two men in the manner (P-164).Sayers on the feet of honesty, or rider on the merits of determination, and fear does not repeat you from that.Remember God, that is: separate him with your entirety until you think about it, or if you believe in the reference to the survival after the annihilation; Remember God Almighty; To collect the difference after the group at that time, but before that, there is no male, as there is no bias or preferred, and it was said to the grooms: Do you love?He said: Who is me?!I am, and some of them said: I am who loves and whoever loves, I am the spirit of the spirit of our solutions, so if we see me, I will see it ∗∗∗ and if you see it, we will not see it.That is, their hidden ones, the headquarters of their whims, their residences and their offspring from the world, and what they have left to them with the types of passion, and they are the people, and they are the people of the With the most desperate people who are exalted in God;
