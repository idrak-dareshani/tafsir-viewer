The Quranic researcher (P-2) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, will say the foolishness, that is, the fear of the dreams or the one who is inspired by the cure and the symptoms of the man The denials to change the kiss from the hypocrites, the Jews and the partners, and narrated from the Saddi, the confinement over the first, and on the authority of Ibn Abbas al -Muqtar al -Qayyimi, and from the second The restrictions on the third, and perhaps the intention of a sect, this verse has come down in their right, not to carry the verse on it; Because the collection is in it, a solution with the imam, and it benefits the general, so he enters in it all, and the specialization of some calls for a call, and the informing of the lord of the one who said to the one who said: The soul is with it, for the surprise of the perpetrator is more painful, and the knowledge of it is before the fall of the fog.For the characteristic, and in the proverb: before the threw, the arrow is broken.Let the fall after the news, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: The face in the custody is the learning and the alert that this is the one who has been said, He does not care about him, and he does not pate from him, and he is mentioned to him that the knowledge and the alerts are reminded of the masculinity of the remembrance of this question and the answer.Al -Qaflal said: The verse came down after the kissing of the kiss, and if he memorized “he will say” he wants from the past, and this is as the man says if he does a work, then he will do so His enemies: I know that they will obey me as if he wants that if he remembers once, they will remember him other times, and he supports that what he narrated from the wealth On the authority of him, he said: “And when the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, came to him, he will be blessed with the house God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, loves to turn to the side of the kaaba, so God Almighty revealed: We have seen flipping and your face in the heavens, so he said: What they do not have to do with the last of the verse, and in the narration of Abu Ishaq and Ubayd ibn Hamid and Abu Hatim from him an increase, so God Almighty revealed: And the appropriateness of the verse, as before that, the first is a praise in the origins, and this is in a matter related to the branch, but it was not overwhelmed by alerting it to the resignation of each of them.From the people in the position of a position in the case, and what is meant by the sex, and the extension of its male, the alerts are on the same as the mortality of their murmur with the measurement to the gender, and it is said: Bayan is that that is the storyteller, and every individual of that kindness, but from their hardships, is used to those who are accustomed Hide.What they have has anything to do The guardian, which is the second, after the first, is not chapter, and the understanding of the denial.On the authority of their kisses, it means the house of the sanctuary, and it is a verb from the opposite, like the face of the face, and the origin of the situation that was on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was in the abbey, (P-3) The interviewer is directed to the prayer.Which they had to do with it, and the connection is the righteousness of the kiss, and in its description of that after its addition to the guerrilla of the Muslims, it is a certainty of the denial of this, and this is a certainty of the denial On the basis of the reckoning of their grace, the grace of the transcription, and their voices, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, are upon him in the kiss, until they said: We follow you and believe in you, and perhaps what they wanted with that, except for his death on him, peace and blessings To it and the victory about it, without it, so that they were saying: He was a desire to kill his fathers, then he returned to it, and he returned to them, and he returned to them.The hypocrites are different from the contradiction of their origins, for they are of Jews and others, and the people differed in the period of its survival, which is accepted by the place of the place; In the narration of Bukhari, you did not know, and in the narration of Malik Bin Anas, nine months or ten months, and from the one twenty -month, a month, and from the sincere, and the one who is a honest one, He accepted others before it was done by Mecca or not?They say their second months, which is the narrator also from the sincere, may God be pleased with him.Say to God, the deceased and the Moroccan, that is, all the places and the mourners are full of Him, and it is equivalent to the lineage to it, the glory of it, and it is not for it.The lesson is for the compliance of his command, so he may cost his worshipers to receive any place and any destination, and he will guides whoever will be made to a righteous path, that is, the way of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The tendency to the house of the sanctuary is one and to the other Kaaba, and the sentence is the same as the detection of what was presented, and it is a sign of the correction of the recipient, and this is to the one that is like it.For the recipient of the municipality, God is the Almighty to whom he will be blessed and sealed from his worshipers, and we have been specialized in it, and he has praise.
