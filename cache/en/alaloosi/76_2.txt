place of the host, the virtue of the righteousness, the righteousness of the They disagreed with a general and a privilege that missed the millions, and there is no doubt that the bearing is upon him, peace be upon him, in this, and there is no face for him, and we do not break with him on the will of the gans, and there is no one in the power of it.Yes, his saying is a sperm from the sperm on the

Abbas also, and he said in the narration of Abu Salih from him, who passed by him four years before he was blown away by him And the sects.In the narration of the laughter of him, that he was created from clay, and he set up four years, then from the time of the elderly, and he set up four years, then a prayer, so he stayed, so he stayed.After one hundred and ten years, then the soul was blown in it, and the Mawardi narrated from him that the one who is mentioned here is the long time that is not known.It was narrated from Akrama, so Abd Bin Hamid and Ibn Al -Mudhr al -Mundhir were removed from him that he said that from the time when he does not realize, and he said: Until God Almighty created it.And I saw for some of the authors that this is the denial of the denial, so it is in the sense of negation, that is, what came to the human being when the forever is not a thing that is a little The human being in time in the sense that there was no time except for a human being, and he is the loyal foot, as he said with him who said from the philosophy, and he is disbelieving in the gathering (P-152) The evidence for the feet of the human being has with that advertisement without the affairs of the provision of the harm that it is the same as it is an objectionable time and is guided to this.358 One of the angels is if it was not in the world who is on the image of the truth, what the intended one has obtained from the knowledge of the truth.I did not know, so I loved to know, and I created the creation and recognized them, so know me.He made itself a treasure and the treasure is only a hindrance in something, so the treasure of the truth was not itself except in the form of the whole human being in the matter When the human right was dressed in the matter of existence, the treasure appeared with its appearance, so the whole person knew it with his existence, and he knew that it was a place in it in the matter With it, it is not hidden, and it is not hidden that all things are in the matter of evidence, and there is no human being alone, and perhaps they say that the human being is everything because he is the one who has said that the imam said

of mixing in the sense of mixed mixed, it is said: the thing is watered if it mixes it and mixes it, then it is irritated and marked, and it is a row, and it is a row and a row of the righteousness of it.A single because what is meant by a group of water, women, and collection may be said on one of the one, or by adopting the different parts of them, in which they are, and a ritual, and a ritual,

descending of the description of the house of the house of the gathering It was said that it is a single that came on verbs as a tree and a lash in their saying, with a tenth of the tenths of any fraction, and the cold, that is, the spindle of its murmur.And his choice of Zamakhshari and Al -Mashhur from the text of his Sibuhi and the gathering of grammarians that actions are not a group and it was reported that he went to that in the year and the meaning The most sperm was mixed and mixed with the water, and it was said: Dollars, licks, zeroes, and sovereign were mixed with, and the shreds of the same mixture that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who

the veins that are in the sperm, and it was narrated from that of the people of the soul It was narrated from Akrama, and so Ibn Abbas said that he said “tactics”.We have a state of our creation, and

will be after making it a hearing, not a good.His two sayings, so we made it a visible hearing, and the words were said to be old and late, and the sentence is an alleged navigational (P-153) Let us

not.The first and the first direction, and this is the cause of the caused by the reason, because the intended is the one who made it, as well as to look at the verses of the horizons and the souls of the name So, he was kind to the creation that restricted him with fulfillment and arranged for him his saying.
