The researcher of the Qur’an is up to the Almighty: I saw if it was on the guidance or commanded piety and his saying is glorified and exalted: I saw if he lied and turns the first and the first of the first and for the first and for the first and for the first and for the first and for the first A deleted, and it is a guarantee that he will return to him or the name of a reference to which he refers to it, and the second verb for the third is the saying of it: I did not know that God did not know Also, which is estimated at them, and its purification is left, in a way You have been asked to it, but it is necessary for a right and that is not from the conflict; Because the sentence is not valid, but it is one of the intellectuals and the deletion in the other hand, and the condition of the condition in the two sentences is deleted to the one who knows it.As it is required by the industry, and it was said: It is indicated by it: (I saw) intended for what will be remembered as a relative if God Almighty wills and appreciate the same, and the words are not.An enforcement, and the guarantee that is the one who is not far from the actions of the end and what is meant by: "I saw" my news; (P-184) The vision is when it was because of the knowledge, the concession is done for it, the course of the informative about its comment and the consequences of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Husing the questionnaire here, and this procedure is what is understood from the words of some of the imams, it is with the visionary vision and the heart of the heart, and for the sacrifice in it Everyone is what a group has chosen for everyone who reconciles to be a address to those who have a hold.It was said: For a human being like a speech in your Lord.And you intend to "slave" on what is the appearance of the words of some to the denial, and the extension of the forbidden with the kindness will feel that the forbidding of the prayer is in the case In the matter of disgrace and the bounty, where I feel that every sentence is intended for it, so they were preached by the first of the forbidden, the first of which is from the prayer, By saying the Almighty: I saw the one who etc.; That is, tell me who has the lowest distinction, or whoever, whoever forbids the prayer, some of God, the Almighty, did you not know that God Almighty will see, and he will be blessed.And his grace was subjected to him secondly, and he was prepared for him, and he is also able to limit him to his limitations that he claims his claim to this With piety; Because the forbidding of something is a matter against it or a commitment to it, so he said: “I saw if it was etc.”; That is, tell me about that forbid, did he not know that God is calling and he will be rewarded if he was guided and guided in the same thing, or if he was a matter of time.He was subjected to a third of him, and he promised him to be able to do it.And when he says, he is lied to the truth of prayer, taking over it, exposing it to its action by saying the Almighty: I saw that if he lied, etc.; That is, tell me about that forbid, did he not know that God is upholstered, and he is informed of his conditions if he lied to the truth of what he forbade and exposed to what he said, It is the Heavy and promised to the forbidden from the prayer with the end of the case of the state of al -Nahi al -Za’di or al -Haqqi, then it was foolish and the most promising of it, Then he was grateful and exalted and promised to exposure to his true condition, and this is like a promotion in the mine.And the gathering is on the authority of the two parties in the part of the conditions of what we mentioned, where they said: If it is on a chain of narration, while it is forbidden by the servants of God, or the worship While he is commanded by the worship of the two as it is the benefit or the falsehood of the right and the one who is on the right to the right thing, as we say, and it is mentioned that the second condition is for the second condition.The first: It is not at the guidance, and it was explained that the insertion of the condition of the condition in the first to relax the tenderness is a picture and the judgment is true; As it is not forbidden for his worship and the command of the worship of idols, the guidance of bit, and in the second of that and the recklessness of the first; As there is no doubt that it is a liar who is began, and they are their fosters to one.It was said: The vision in the first sentence is a vision, so you do not need a second effective, and in the second and third hearts, and the first verb is on what is provided His preoccupation with the first conditional sentence with her answer, and he was in the last, did he not know, etc.For the remembrance of it before it is a deleted, it is not over it, and the last was not overwhelmed by what accepted it to the permission of the erection of its argument with the rituals in the soul of the matter The answer is infected with it, but before it, the condition of the condition is in it, it is only for the mobilization of the circle, and it is the secret of his repentance from the answer and the referral of it, with the answer to it, And the discourse is in all of those who reconcile him, and the call to "servant" to be disappointed by prayer and peace be upon him, and the end of the forbidden and the affirmation of the strangeness of it: If he was guided when he forbids him from the worship of God, the Almighty, etc.He mentioned what he did not know that God sees and looked at him, and he will be rewarded for it.It was said: “I saw” in the three sentences of the heart vision, the first verb for the first priority, and its second action is the premature sentence with the first condition of the first.It is for the second condition of the conditional.As it is known as the harm of the interview.And the second "I saw" a remedy for the first, and "I saw" the third and its first effective is deleted for the readers.Because it meets the first To meet between the two policemen, his saying means: If it is etc., and his saying is his grace: (p-185) if he lied, etc.And in the coming of the last sentence without kindness, a filter for the crying words and alert it to the condition of the condition It was presented first and the words before the description and the relaxation of the tenderness, and therefore it was said: “worship” and he did not say: a prophet who is repeated, so it was said: Tell me, whoever tells me, who is the one who has been.This is the one who ends up the servants of God, the best of the Prophet, who is obligated to his prayers, if that is the forbidding of this, while he is forbidden by the servants of God He commands him from the worship of idols as it is claimed, and so if it is a denying the truth and the one who is correct, as it says: Did he not know.It was said: (I saw) in the second and third sentences of the first and the two conditions, with their answer, two prevailing the lion of the second verb for the first, and the one who did not know.The second and the first answer is deleted for his path to him, and he did not say: Or if he lied, etc.Because he is not in a chapter of what he accepted on what was said.The meaning is the same as what you heard, and all of these sayings were mentioned that in the convergence of the two people in the way of the condition, without the fulfillment, and it is not the fulfillment of the condition His revelation and the satisfaction of the satisfaction, and testify to him with his saying: Say: I see you if the torment of God comes to you with a thick or a wicker, does he give you the oppression of the people We transfer the zamhiri itself in the detail, and the transfer of others is the obligation of fulfillment if the penalty is a constructive sentence and the understanding, and if it is not left to the right, it is not necessary The revelation of creation.Abu Hayyan said: The fall of the sentence of the interrogation is an answer to the condition, without fulfillment, I do not know one of them.It is deleted only in a harm or poetry.Al -Daamini said in the explanation of Al -Tasheel: If he makes: Is it a problematic reward for the bond of fulfillment of fulfillment, and those who are associated with it in the same way.It was also assumed to make the conditional sentence in the position of the second effective of “I saw” that its second effective is only a sentence that is not the same Live and group, or division as in the guidance.Al -Khafaji said: The condition of the condition is in the location of the active and the interrogative sentence in the position of the condition of the police, either on its appearance or on the authority They were made, as if they were for their lion, the lion of the verb and the answer, and what was mentioned, the satisfaction of the one who is satisfied and the Imamini stated in the explanation of the sacrifice in the chapter on the name of the sign, then what was said is that the one who said: "You see" it is not a championship, contrary to what They stated that he is the choice of his Sibu, so I did not fulfill it, and they did not make it when the speech was mentioned to the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and for the sake of the peace of God To the exit of the forbidden and the one who is from the universal of the speech.And he appeared in the sea.What is meant is to visit the situation with a total title, which is as it is seen.It was said: The bruise in “if it is, and command” to the worshiper servant, and the guerrilla in “lied and fell asleep, and knows” to the one who ends.And he has the meaning of what Al -Fura said: I saw the one who ends a servant who prayed, and the one who is at the guidance and commanded to piety and the forbidden is a liar who is in charge of what is more liked.And it is clear that the condition of the condition is a deleted, and it is: What is likes to be a village (you see), for it is the admiration of the admiration, and the vision is in it.A deleted, like this answer, and it was said: Basriyah and “did not know”, etc., a ritual sentence, to replace what was before it and affirming it, It was said: The rhetoric in (I saw) the second of the disbelievers and in the second of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The last, as if he had grabbed him, he said: Oh, infidel, tell me if his prayers are guided and his prayers to God, upholding a matter of piety, ending him?And tell me, O Messenger, if the forbidden is denying the right to be on the authority of the correct religion, did he not know that God Almighty rewards him.This one who said about the speech was silent in (I saw) the first, and it was said: For everyone who reconciles for him, and it was said: For a person, and it was said: For the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.And his saying: It is forbidden, it is impeded that he made him an effective to see, and it is possible that it is the condition of the condition or as it is in its past, and perhaps the remembrance of the matter of the ritual (P-186) The forbidding of what was said was about prayer and the command of it, and it was a phenomenon that he should mention in the first sentence, too He was deleted with his remembrance in the second, and he was fired on the remembrance of prayer, and it was not reflected because the matter of piety is a saying, and the prayer is a prayer, and the ritual is a prayer Say.Rather, it was a call and an command because the one who was stalled with it, if he did a verb, was in the power of his saying: Do this.It was said: The reminder first is not forbidden from prayer, but the forbidden at the time of prayer, and it is an innervated that it is for it or otherwise, and the general prayer of the prayer for what is in the way The worshiper with worship and the unimaginable of it, so that it will be forbidden in that state that will be from prayer and supplication with him, so if he is mentioned in the second sentence.Do not be forgiven.The Imam was permitted as the one who has the speech in all of him, peace and blessings be upon him.[Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and
