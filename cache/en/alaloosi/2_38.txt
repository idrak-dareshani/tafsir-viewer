that he is the highest that he wanted, and had it not been for his will, it would not have been, and that is the bond of frustration to his soul, with the time The chain of transmission to the Satan,

who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the divorce, A covenant, and he is known, and in what is meant by it, there are sayings, so it was said: the books that are revealed, and it was said: the messengers, and it was said: Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him His proponents came upon him, peace and blessings be upon them, and fulfillment in (who) for the bond (and what) after a conditional sentence, and I was answered for the first condition for me: To you, and Al -Sajandi said: His answer is deleted, that is, they followed him, and the choice of Abu Hayyan Koen (who) is this connected to what is in the opposite of the one who is in the case, Let it include the meaning of the condition, and the appearance is placed in the position of the dominant in (my guidance) as a sign of the high, because the guidance in the view of itself, and the one who fulfilled the same I add to it the extension of the addition of a more fresh and more right to be followed, and it was said: He did not come to him as a guarantee because he is better than the first to be included in what he did, and he is not.The guidance, so that the eye does not repeat it as well, because the denial is mostly in the first place, if it is repeated, it was the first eye with what is in the addition to its soul, it is not the highest.It is defined by the imam, the fear of the fearful in the future, and the sorrow against the secrets is taken from the sorrow, which is what the land is overlooked, as if it is not the same On the most

the fear is made for the denial of the punishment, and the denial of the sorrow is a man from the denial of the Al -Sarah and Akkad, because it is like the pretext of something with a statement and the meaning: there is no fear for them, as a matter of being a good person, and they will not be lost from them, and they will not miss them.The exile from the guardians is the fear of the solutions of the deceased, and the sadness in the hereafter, and it has a sign that it enters the paradise that is the house of the secret and the security, and there is no fear in it And then, the interview

rich richness from his example, as well as what was said: that the exile of the one who is the one who is exhausted, The indication is that the fear is on the authority of them, and this is read (Hada) with the universe Al -Jahdari and others (Haddi) with the heart of the thousand J and its slurring in the ya on the language of this, and the Zahri and others read (so no fear) By raising from
