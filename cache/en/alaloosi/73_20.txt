The Quranic researcher is that your Lord knows that you are lower than two thirds Say what is between them from the bias, and it is in it a messenger that is sent, because the proximity requires the lack of bias between the two things, so it is used in its necessity or in the division The analogy between the near and the few to be there is a slogan and the abuse is closer, and the good and the goodness, and Abu al -Hayyah and Ibn al -Sama’a, and Ibn Mujahid, were read The full "third" in the place of the mother, and that came from Nafaa and Ibn Amir, while the owner of the lamp was mentioned.And his half and the third of the setting is a lower one, as if it was said that you are raising than the night less than his thirds, and he will be described, and he will be seen, And his half and a third of it with the righteousness of the night, that is, it is less than the third and less than the half and is less than the third and the first of the third and the first is the custodian Between the righteousness of the half of its completeness and between the righteousness of the deficiency from it, which is the third and between the rise of the one who is the one who is the minimum of the third and the second is the way to the one From the third and between the third, which is lower than the half and between the quarter, which is lower than the third, so he said otherwise, so do not be forgiven and the command is formed from How is the health of the knowledge of God Almighty for their signs, and they are not collecting and answered that this is according to the facts of the hamters, so he fell in every time, so there is no time for him, so there is no time for him.This place is in terms of the ability of the matter of the matter, and it is more than that it is obligatory, either the violation of the Prophet ﷺ for what he was commanded by him or his abandonment and the sin (p-111) (p-111) correct.As for the first, he is a backward, not, as well as the matter of the obligatory prayer Step and I answer with commitment that the matter is and responded to the least, but they have increased caution against the fall in the violation, and it was difficult for them and the knowledge of God, they did not.They signed in the violation, so we were copying the matter as well as it was said, and he contemplated.Those with you are kind to the one who is in the way that is established and the separation is good between them, that is, a group of your companions, and God is not able to do the night Their hours are as they are (except) God Almighty.If his name is presented, a beginner, based on it, is appreciated by a significant man If you will not be counted, the guilt is for a source that is appreciated, not to do the concept of words and meaning, knowing that the affair will not be able to do so that you will be able The hours do not come to you with the equity and leveling (except) that you take the nine for the time, and that is difficult for you to be from you, so that you will be blessed with you.The estimated and the lifting of the follower from you in its blessings, so the words are on the verge, where the semi -relaxation is likened to the acceptance of the repentance in the lifting of the follower, and it is used in the ritual of the seed.In the likeness, as in his saying, the Almighty, he repented to you and forgives you, and now they will be blessed [the cow: 187], and some of them claimed that he is what he is from him, so he said: He left some of what he was commanded and not in something.Read what the Qur’an is pleased with, that is, separate what you can make from the prayer of the night, expressing the prayer by the sake of the prayer, as he expressed it with the captives of it.The words were said to his truth from seeking the Qur’an with its eyes and in which there is a distance from the one who is the one who is in the context of the context and whoever goes, that is, the first said that God is the Almighty, who will be supposed to be.In his saying, the night, the night, etc., then copy it by the resurrection of some of it in his saying, and they will repent to you, so read the verse, and the command is in the matter.That the duty was first, it was a certainty and secondly, it was divorced and then copied the grapes of the resurrection of the nation, divorced with the five prayers, and whoever is the one who gave me the good They were permitted to leave all the resurrection and commanded the rule of something from the Qur’an at night, as if it was said, and he was repeated to you and he was permitted in the blessing, so read what you will see from the Qur’an.If this does not make it hard and obtain this reading, the reward of resurrection, and a group stated that they read on this matter that we are deflected by this.And know that they disagreed with the matter of glorification, so he was a fighter and Ibn Kaisan that he was a murk before the prayer was imposed by the fifth of the fifth, then it is not.Al -Bukhari and a Muslim in the hadith of Jabir, and the Imam narrated Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawid, Al -Darmami and Ibn Maja and Al -Nasa’i, “On the authority of Sa`d ibn Hasham, who said: I told me about the creation of the Messenger of God ﷺ She said: Did you read the Qur’an?Until I died, then I seemed to me, and I told me about the rise of the Messenger of God.The night is at the beginning of this surah.God Almighty at the end of the surah is the slightest, and the night has become a voluntary.And in a narration on the authority of it, as long as it is a period of one months, "and on the authority of a year that lasted a year or two years, and for some of them that it was obligatory, but the seduction was signed in the place.Two years, and the man was as the dog said, he will be a fearing that he would not memorize what is between the half, the third and the third and the third, and it was said that it was a nose in the same way And the saying of the Almighty, and from the night, then you will find it for you [the princes: 79] it was narrated by one other than one, and they discussed in it, but the imam said that the owner of the revelation said: The selection contradicts the garment, but it is inferred by the sequence, and that the exhibitors have limitations (P-112), which were nine or narrow, and it did not negotiate with the one who delegates to the one who delegates the repetition to A good deed.By that, it is a pleasure for you that it is an excessive one on the exhibits.He prevents him in the right of others ﷺ and the verse is indicated by him, so we do not look at it, then when he mentioned his chances in that surah (and from the night), that is, the one who is the night) And here we have come to the authority of the nation, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: He is the one who has come to the one The negligence in its right and the right of the nation, and this is a narrative saying (except) that his saying is the Almighty that you will not count it, and he will adopt you to support the first and the first of the first The prayers and peace be upon him, and on the nation and the many effects of the effects of which he testifies to him, but in the sea that his saying is the Almighty and a group of those with you, for those who are with you.On the whole, if he was unaware of them, the installation was ((and those with you) (except) that I believe that it was one of them who was in his house and whoever is from him The satisfaction in the right of the whole has ended and you know that it does not appoint a being from the whiteness, but it is necessary to be a bias and whoever says the one who says: By carrying it on that without the membership, by adopting the awareness, it is not in that, and God Almighty knows.We call the readings of something from the Qur’an at night and in some antiquities, “Whoever reads a hundred verses on a night that the Qur’an did not arise” and in some of it, “Whoever reads a hundred people in a hundred” Fifth of a verse and the one who is dependent on it from the two sayings in which the first saying was heard and you have heard that The matter is for him for the positive and that it was obligatory to do something of the night, then he copied and answered the nation with the pupil of the five prayers, so it is the right of the day After the interpretation, they read to pray and the story of what was said of the copying, and this matter is when it is a matter of permissibility, and the good and the son of Sirin said: Ibn Jabir and a group is a custody of it, even if it is in the capacity of five, the end of it.And the appearance of his face is that these are the ones who said with his souls today, and that he did not copy the garment divorced, but he copied a sinner, and this is the disagreement of the The night of the nights of the Messenger of God ﷺ and became a virginity and the remaining of that is an abuse on the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and I think the matter is rich in The saying and the say that the righteous predecessor was persistently rejoicing to the rituals of Islam, because of this in the cell with the sake of the sake of God It is up to our success as he succeeded and grants us as (who) to them.There is a search here, which is that the Imam Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him, was inferred from him, and he said: “So, read what is easy from the Qur’an on the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the prayer.With its own, it is a phenomenon on the saying that he has expressed in it the prayer with its rub, and it is the reader as it expressed it with prostration, the righteousness, and the kneeling in the places It was reported by Al -Mawardi and a third of what Ibn Al -Arabi and the question reported in the Pharmacists, and the Shafi’i specialized, and the owners of what is easy to make it easy Her readings in the prayer with many arguments, from which the father of Hamid al -Asfarin said about the son of the one who was warned by his chain of chain of his chain It is read in the book of the book.And from it what was also narrated from Abu Harir from him ﷺ: “Every prayer was not read in it with the opening of the book, as it is cheeks, it is a cheek.” That is, a decrease in the vagina or a shortage, and it is exposed to the fact that the decrease does not indicate the number of permissibility and it is answered that it is indicated that the abandonment of the prayer is in the prayer We were immortalized when you come to the ranks of Al-Kamal, when the two decreases must be up to the original and not come out of the era (p-113) and confirm the saying of Abu The day of Eid is eliminated by Ramadan with the correctness of fasting in it, in which he is bound by him that the obligatory prayer is upon him the fast and fasting in this day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day And from it: His saying ﷺ: “There is no prayer (except) with the opening of the book.” It is a phenomenon in the intended, as the estimation is not valid (except) with it, and it was subjected to a palace that the estimation would be not a complete prayer.For when the denial of the name of the prayer was prevented to prove it without the conqueror, it was not necessary from his behavior to the ruling of its rulings, and it is not from the sake of the sake to the sake of the validity.And I answer (that) we do not receive the abuse of the entry of the negation on its name because it is the conqueror if it is a part of what the prayer is denying what it is for the sake On its name, but it is forbidden, even if it is proven that it is not part of it, and it is the first of the question, we gave it to him, but we do not surrender that he was not to be valid to the validity of it, not from the validity of it.Because the bearing on the relative metaphor is when it is excused for the sake of the truth, but rather, but it is obligatory for consensus, and there is no doubt that the struggle that is not the right to be correct.It is complete and because the origin is the meeting of what was the one who is to be the same and that it was because the deprivation of the forbidden is more likely because it is more than that, and that the prayer is with the light of the conqueror It is not a harm to the consensus that the prayer with it is better, so it is not permissible to destiny to it because it is a curehr The Muslims are good, for God is good.And from her that its readers require the exit of the task with two stories, so it will be the most intense, and it is obligatory to say with its weapons to the text: For the mind, which is the payment of the harm of fear from the soul, it is obligatory.And as the obstacle of the confrontation, the fear is inherited by the pharaoh, as our mistakes are opposed to the contradiction of its numbers, so they will be met.It is obligatory, and the righteousness is not so, and our Hanafi Sadat answered what they answered.And they inferred that the duty is easy from the Qur’an, not the conqueror, with its privileges with matters of what Abu Uthaman al -Nahdi narrated from Abu Hurairah that he said: And calling, not a prayer (except) with the readers, even if the book of the book.It was driven by that he was opposed to what was reported from Abu Hurairah that he said: “The Messenger of God ﷺ commanded me to leave and call me, not a prayer (except) with the opening of the book.” And that it is permissible for what is meant by his saying, even if the book of the book is that if he would be fired on the conqueror, he would not be enough, and it is obligatory to carry upon him the whole, and it is a whole, and it is a gathering The first in the answer is the permissibility of the universe, even if the book of the book is what is before the understanding of the saying of the saying, not life (except) with the power of the might, and if the bread is not the day of this day, and it is not this day.From him and on him the hadith becomes one of the evidences of the obligatory, and from it that if the conqueror had been given to the truth of our saying, the whenever the reader is obligated, and the conqueror is obligated, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the sake of the sake of it.Al -Fateh did not answer, and the reader has to be a journey The release of the readers with consensus, so the two of the advances produce if the Fatihah would not have to be obligated, and the Fatihah is invalid.And I will answer the minor, that is, we do not receive the sincerity of our saying, even if the Fatih did not answer, the reader would have to be the one that is the duty of the conqueror, and it is permissible.The assignment is the raising of the divorced woman who is firmly established by gathering, but we do not receive the impersonation of our saying, even if it is not obligatory He mentioned a nose and made some of the measurement a pilgrimage to the Hanafis, because everything that was obligated and its existence was established, and its existence is a harmful and replied, and it was that it was that it was.The mandate, and it is our saying, even if the conqueror does not have to be fixed in the same matter, and it is not like that, but it is a steadfastness on the estimation He becomes a pilgrimage to them and the blame of speech on that is in his position and that you know that he is on the second saying in the verse that does not appear in the way of the one who is in the authority Prayer, as there is no more than the matter in it with the readers of the Qur’an.And the saying of the Almighty, knowing that there will be a satisfactory satisfaction of the one that is the most difficult of the provision of the determination And dismissal, that is, know that the affairs will be satisfied and others who will strike in the earth, traveling in them for the merchants who seek the grace of God, which is the goodness of God To get the knowledge and the sentence in the position of the situation and others, they will fight in the path of God, meaning the Mujahidin and in the Qur’an of the travelers to seek the grace of God In the reward, Said bin Mansour and Al -Bayaki were removed in the peoples of faith, and others are from Omar, may God be pleased with him It comes to me and I am among my people, a mountain, I seek the grace of God Almighty, and this verse is followed, and others will strike etc.Ibn Mardawi was brought out of Ibn Masoud.His house was with God, “Then the Messenger of God ﷺ” and others who are harmed in the land, seeking the grace of God, and others are fighting.He knew that he will be among the believers who are difficult for him to rise, as he knew his charity, the hardship of statistics of the ability Read what you are facing from any of the Qur’an, without the hardships, and the prayer of the prayer, that is, the disposal, and the Zakat is like that, and on this, the most of the people are the most.With the present prayer Fifth prayers and zakat on the voracious sister.And I was formed that the surah is one of the families of what was descended in Mecca, and the fifth prayers were not imposed except after the prosecution and zakat, but it was imposed in the city and the coffee of the city and that it was done to These verses are civil, and it is said that zakat was imposed with a makkah from other than an appointment to the news, and it was imposed in the city of the one who is aware of the time of the time, so that it is the right of the time.The vocabulary in the sentence, so there is no prohibition on the essence of the verses.A vocabulary that contradicts the relaxation, and it is permissible for the verse to be from what is delayed by his ruling from his descent, and not to do so, and they will be loaned to God.The good or the payment of zakat on the best of faces and its benefit to the poor.And what you were presented to yourself is the best of any good that was mentioned and what was not mentioned by God for God is the best and the greatest reward for any of the one who is delayed to the one who is late And good), secondly, you find it, and it is a confirmation of the guidance that you find, even if it is in the image of the mark Al -Ridhi mentioned it or a guarantor of chapter, and if he does not fall between two knowledge, then I will do from the ruling of the definition, and that is why it is forbidden from the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge From the guarantee of his extension and his illusion, the father of Hayyan is that it is obligatory for him and read the father = the blades with the blame, the enemy and Abu al -Simak in the Kaf, the Ghannaw By raising them on the authority and telling them, and made the sentence in the position of the second effective, Abu Zaid said it is a language of the children of Tamim, who raised after the separation, and it was the one who said: By raising, and on him the saying of Qais Bin Jarah: You are to my son, and you left it, and you were on it with the fullness.For the lift and the righteousness is a light and a narration and the forgiveness of God in all of you, because the human being is ahead of what is considered a release of the lineage to the one who is the one who is the same The vision of the worshipers of his worshipers was said, and for this sign is an order to seek forgiveness after the preceding people in the establishment of prayer and the payment of zakat and lending (p-115) So the guilt of those who seek forgiveness and mercy be forgiven, and he will be exalted, and in the deeds of the work, there is no significance of the general, and the separation of the words is in it.His forgiveness and mercy to us, our religion, and the sufficiency of my believer, his righteousness, with the prohibition of the master of his creation, and the bond of the people of his family.
