The researcher of the Quran, the oppression of those who prevented the mosque of God, descended in Titus bin Esianus Al -Roumi and his companions, and that is that they invaded the children They wandered them, burned the supply, raised the house of the sanctuary, and threw it in it, and slaughtered the pigs in it, and it remained alienated until it was built in the mother of the Muslim.The rhetoric, may God be pleased with him, narrated a gift from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them The forbidden, and on the first, the verse will be given to the words of the Almighty: The Christians said that the story of a story of a story of their loved ones, and on the second, and on the second, In a lot of a sentence between the conversation, it means: they said, take, and the one who is given to him means: I said to the Jews, to the state of the partners who have been the one who has been seen.The book, for the two publishers who are comparable to them if they are the injustice of the disbelief, and the appearance of the general verse in every reason, and in every mosque, and the privileges of the reason, it does not prevent it.The impact of the news of those who are intended, and it is not intended to understand it, but it is in the sense of the negation, and it is referred to the news, that is, no one will be darkened by that, and this is the same, and this is the same.It was reported in the Qur’an as whoever is darkened by those who mentioned the verses of his Lord, then he will be exposed to it, so whoever is darkened by those who are overwhelmed by God, who is a liar, so whoever is wrong with whom However, if the meaning is on this, it is necessary to contradict, and it is answered by specialization, either with what is understood from the soul of the prayers, or with the naps to whom it comes from the one who came from the one who came from the one who came from the one It is for the precedent in manufacturing, or the expatriate, as well The meaning, so the first is to be answered by that that does not indicate the negation of the settlement in the oppression, and the closeness of what is understood from the verses is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is mentioned in it If you say: No one will be worsened from the increase, age and immortal, it does not indicate more than a denial that one of them is one of them The mosques of God is an example, and God did not fool as a liability of the less injustice than those between them, so it is not equal in the oppressor, because this is the one who is in this way.In it, as the infidelity is one thing in which it is unable There is a violation in it, the father of Hayyan said it and does not hide what is in it, and one has said other: if you say: (Whoever is darkened by whoever does such) is a denial, because there is no one who is from him for him, And if it was not the reason for the installation of equality, and its negation, except that the fascist and the recovered recovery is witnessed to him, then if it is said: It is better than so, so what is meant by it is the fact that it is generous than every generosity, and more preferred than every virtuous, so perhaps the first one may return to one of the two answers with the observation of the words, and the words of the words Granding exaggeration of the exaggeration in the supplies, and the dirt with the cutting of the view of the negation of equality, or the increase in the same matter as it was said by the arbitrator, And the saying, and the say, is considered, and it is planned, to mention its name a second effective to prevent it, or the effective for it in the sense of (P-364), preventing it as a reminder of it.The mosques, and the second action is permissible, i.E.Its righteousness, or worship in it, or its grace, or the people of the mosque of God, or not to be able, and the verb, and the verb, and the verb, With the remembrance of the name of God, the Almighty is what is signed in the mosques of prayers and approximation to God Almighty with the hearts of the heart and the gossip that are permissible to do with it.And he sought in its murder, that is, its demolition and its obstruction, and the one said: It is a sense of interpretation because it is its worship with worship in it, those who are unjust in the one who are in the way.They would not have entered it except the disagreement of the pain in (for them) either for the elimination of the face of the year, as in the majority of the mare, and what is meant by the fear of the fear of God In the paradise of the believer, and it is intended from the fearful fear of the believers, or to the conjugation of the crops, that is, what was for them in the knowledge of God, and the one who has the same He will only come, and the sentence on the first will be angry with a question that arose from his saying, the Almighty: He sought in its horse as if it was said: So what is the dignity?What is meant by injustice is then the place of the thing in other than its position, and on the second, the answer is a question arising from the saying of his followers: and whoever is from the one who is from what is from what is from what is from it Their right?What is meant by injustice is the behavior in the right of others, and on the third, there are symptoms between two words, connected to the meaning, and in it and the dimension of the believers, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.And to fulfill that and his mediation, and God has succeeded and promised, and praise be to God.It was narrated that he did not enter the house of the sanctuary.There is a victory in the house of the sanctuary, except that it is a warning, and it is notified of it in the wise one, and we do not condemn the calamity of the sins, and to keep the house of the sacred in the mother of the A year, until the king is used by the goodness of religion, because the achievement calls for its verification in some time, and there is no significance in it on the righteousness, and it was said: the denial of the meaning The forbidden kinette from The abandonment, and the ownership of their income is the mosque, and that is required that they only enter it It is forbidden for the abandonment and the ownership of the power of the disbelievers and their prohibition of mosques, there is no use in it except for the notification of the enemy of the believers and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the believers So the bearer of it is one of the first things, and the imams were different in the entry of the unbelievers, so Imam Abu Hanifah visited him, may God be pleased with him They benefit their entry with fear and fear, and because the redeeming of the rituals offered upon him peace and blessings be upon him, so the mosque descended them, and he said: (Whoever enters the house of Abu Sufyan is safe, and whoever enters the kaab is safe), and the end is forbidden to enlist He is upset with him, because of his saying: Rather, the partners are unclean and the mosque must be abandoned from spoils, and therefore the side is forbidden from the entry, and it is forbidden to enter the entry.The Shafi’i Imam, may God be pleased with him, separated him from the mosque and otherwise, and he said: The hadith is woven with the verse, and the servant of God has read (except for the sake) A treasure, that is, a great person, killing their heroes, their elders, breaking their idols, and sorry their dreams, and their exaggeration from the island of the Arab Their heads, or by the confusion of the reward for the

in the two people for the eagerness of what is mentioned after it.* * * And from the chapter on the sign in the verse: whoever is lowering and deficient in the right of those who prevented the positions of prostration to God Almighty, which is the hearts (P-365) in which he knows, The one who is mentioned in it is mentioned in its own name, which is the greatest name, as it does not appear

entered it and prayed to it, except for those who are broken by the appearance of the truth in it, the right to the right in it, and the right in it.And a humiliation with the appearance of the heroes
