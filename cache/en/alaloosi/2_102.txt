The researcher followed what the predecessors recite a kindness on (renounced), and the guarantee of a group of those who have given the book, on what was presented about the dam, and it was said: Before him, the compassion of the story is for the story, and the guarantee of those who were presented from the Jews, or those who were in the time of Soliman, peace be upon him, or those who were in the peace He is upon him and peace be upon him, or what everyone is in charge, because that is not back, as it is required to enter into (what), and their followers, this is not a chain of transmission.God Almighty, peace be upon him, and in which you have learned from the saying of the six -year The distance, but it is not presented to him by those who have gone a dignity of fairness, and what is meant by the followers of the seizure and the acceptance of something in the whole, and it was said: (And Talato) I prayed, meaning: it follows, or read, and it is a story of a past condition, and the origin: followed, and the saying of the Kufic: the meaning is what you have been.If there is an estimated, and the one who is repeated from the thieves is the murder of heaven, and it is the saying of the most, and it was said: What is meant by the people of humanity, which is the saying of the one who is the one who is the one The good, and the laughing (the shirts), at the same time as the one who narrated the Arabs from the Arab Related to (Talawo), and in the words an added deleted, that is, the covenant of his king, and his time, or the king is metaphor for the era, and on the one who is in me () (Ali) In his words, the Almighty: And to your origins in the trunks of the palm tree, and it was stated in Al-Tasheel with its coming to the perception, and it is for him to do so, and this is the same.The covenant does not reconcile his being a reader of it, and from the companions who deny the coming (Ali) in the sense of (in) and made this one of the two (you are tired) A phrase about Al -Karsi, because it was one of his king's machines, so the words are at the same time: I read the al -Muabar, and what is meant by what the magic follows, so it was lost.Jarir, the ruler, and corrected it, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, who said: The demons used to hear the heaven, so if he hears it, then he heard them.A thousand lies, and the hearts of the people were drinked, and they took it, so the exalted be upon that, so that Solomon Bin Dawid, so he took it and took it, and took it, and took it.Soliman died, Satan rose up with the way, and he said: Do I not show you the treasure of Solomon, who is not a treasure for anyone like his manicne,?They said: Yes, and they broke it up, so if it is magic, then the nations were harnessed, so God Almighty revealed Solomon as they said From the magic, and it was said: It was narrated that Solman was a many of the sciences that God has summed up with the Almighty under the authority The burials, when a period of time went on, the people of the opponents are connected until they wrote through that things from the magic that are appropriate for those who are from those who are from those who are from those who are from those who are from those who are.After his death and inform the people on those books or their delusions that they are from the knowledge of Solomon, and the weakness of this narration is not hidden, and Solomon is as in the sea: The knowledge of the scientific and the legend, and its counterpart from the Ajamiyyah in the fact that the last one is a thousand and important noun, and what is two and Shaman, and his abstinence from the flag of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge As a mission, because their increases are eager to derive, and to disgrace, and they enter the diligent names, and a lot of people today, on the other To see Solomon, peace be upon him.Solomon reminds with the prophets, but it was wasting, the wind is riding, and his grace crossed the magic with the disbelief with the way of the kinna as a pursuit of the one) His exalted say: But the two devils are disbelievers, they teach people magic, so (they disbelieved) with it is used in its realistic, and the sentence of the one who knows) The devils are, and it is answered that (but) does not work immediately, and it is answered that there is a shame of the verb, and it was said: a replacement of those who disbelieved, and it was said: I am normal, and the guarantee of the people, or for those who are not.Follow, and magic in the origin is the source of magic, magic with the opening of the eye in them, if it shows what is tight and hidden, and it is one of the abnormal sources, and it is done, What is meant by a strange matter that resembles the supernatural, and does not do this in which learning is running, and he is used to obtain it by approaching the one who is the one who says it Population, praise of the Satan, and its mockery, and work as the slaves of the makers and the commitment of crocodiles and the brochures of the debauchery, and the consequences of the charity of what is required to be close to it, Thus, only those who adopt it in the stray, and the breath of the soul, are not satisfied, for the appropriateness of the condition of solidarity and contempt, so that the angels are only the same In the perseverance of worship and approach to God Almighty with words and deeds, as well as those who are not accustomed to only the rituals that are similar to them in the betrayal, and the one who said, With this, the magician is distinguished from the Prophet and the guardian, so he does not return what the disgraced said: that if only a person was able And the arrogance of the absences, as the way of the prophecy is the way of magic.Tara, and on the elaboration of the emptiness of the other, and with the pharmacy of the medicine, such as Narnsjat, or the owner of the light of the hand shows, so his name is magic on the one (P-339) When some, and the nawye stated in the ritual with his prohibition, and the crowd made it easy to be the habit of the nomadic, the soul of the evil, And the gathering is that he has a truth, and that he has reached the witch to where he flies in the air, walks on water, kills the soul, and turns the human being, God is exalted, and his Sunnah did not leave with the sinking of the witch from the seas of the sea, the brightness of the dead, and the scope of the old, and otherwise of the verses of the messengers, and the peace be upon them, The expression of our companions is that there is no truth to him, but it is a seduction, and I disbelieve the disbelievers who said with the rhetoric The prophecy, and not as they claimed what is not hidden, and from the investigators who separated between the magic and the miracle of the miracle of the miracle, with no one, for the other His appearance on the hands of the claimant of a false prophecy, as God's habit of the exalted, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The work with it is a disbelief, until the informed sciences said: There is no difference in that, and its promise is a type of cabinet, the stimulant of the trace is not contrary to that, because the disbeliever is the one who is the disbelief From it, and there is a search, but first: because the sheikh is Abu Mansour, he went until the saying that magic is disbelieving on the divorce, but it is obligatory, but it is obligatory to search for it, That is the response of the condition of the condition of faith, so it is disbelief, otherwise no, and perhaps what is gone to the science is based on interpretation first Second: Because what is meant by the trace is in the past of the bonds, the divorce of the infidelity, or the types of infidels are removed from them, then the magic that is an infidel is killed by the male, and there is no male, and there is no male, and there is no male, and there is no male, and there is no male, and there is no male, And in it the soul of the soul is in the ruling of the ritual of the way, and it is equal to the male and the females, and its repentance is accepted if it repents, and whoever says it does not accept it Their repentance was accepted, such as in the context, and perhaps to the origins, and the most famous of Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him His saying is accepted: I leave the magic, and I repent from it, for if I acknowledge that I was a period of time, and I have left for a time before him, and he did not kill him, and he did not kill him That a neighbor of the mother of the believers, may God be pleased with her, was exaggerated, so they took it, so she confessed to that, so I commanded the servant Hatman, may God be pleased with him, was that he killed her without his time, and what was narrated from Omar, may God be pleased with him Satar, and Al -Shafi’i looked at this pilgrimage, and exposed to the saying of the killing, divorcing that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, did not kill him, and he did not kill him.The believer is the same for his saying, peace be upon him: “(They have no Muslims, and upon them what is on the Muslims), and fulfill it in Al -Farawah, And he learned it, and it was said: a disbelief for this verse, as the ruling on the ruling on the appropriate description, and it is feelings of the high, and I will answer that it is not for you, and I will not answer that The meaning is that they disbelieved, and they are with that they teach the magic, and it was said: They are forbidden, and it has the interruption of the gambling, and it was said: Makhuhan, and it is the gold of the bit.The argument for the vilification here is the prohibition of learning of the seduction and the misguidance, and the money of the Razi Imam, saying: The investigators agreed that the knowledge is not with the knowledge of the Because the knowledge of itself is a mourning for the general saying of the Almighty: Is it equal to those who know and those who do not know, even if he did not know the magic of the Magic The miracle, and the knowledge of the miracle is a miracle and a duty, and what is required is the duty of it, then it is obligatory, so this requires that it be the knowledge of the knowledge And you should be a forbidden and a dome, and some of them transferred and his knowledge of the Mufti until he knows what he kills with, and what he does not kill him, and he is not killed in it, and he will be in it, I have a sanctuary for the masses, except for a legal fare, and when God's mercy said it, the Almighty is a view, but first: because we do not claim that it is a chaos, but it is the same.It is arranged on it, and it is forbidden by it (P-340) from the door of the bridal of the arms, and how many things are forbidden for that, and in the hadith: “Whoever protects the domination of the one who is about to fall into it) The difference between him and between the miracle is based on knowledge of it, not to see that the most scholars, or all of them except the one who knows the difference between them, did not know the difference between them It is enough for a separation between them what was presented, and if he had learned it, he would have been obligated to this The duty, and this saying came to him, or that he was disturbed by it as they were overwhelmed, and a third: because what is said about some of them is not correct, because the mufti is not the opposite His knowledge is required to know the magic, because a picture His statement on what was mentioned by the son of the son of a stone, if he witnessed the knowledge of the magic, and he repented from him that he kills most of the magician, otherwise, no, this is not, and this is not.The magic is on the walk among the people with the name, because there is a heart of the friend as an enemy, and the enemy is a friend, as it is called the goodness Because it is in it, and it is called a halal magic, and it is his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him: For the eloquence and rhetoric is distant, and if the people of the people went to the hadith, and the appearance of its saying is the Almighty: (they teach), etc.It was said: They indicate that of those books, so they will be released on that significance in order to release the causes It is harmful and beneficial, and that Solomon, peace be upon him, was fulfilled by what was done with that, and the release of it is the release, and it was said: They know in the sense that they know, and they know that it is from the flag, and it is known With what or with those who learn about it, or from it magic, and read a bonus, Aidaim and Ibn Katheer, Abu Amr (but) with tension, and the son of Amir, And the reaction of what is after it with the sake of appealing, and the news, and it is permissible for its work if it is reduced, in which there is a disagreement, and the collection is forbidden, which is correct, and on the authority of Yunus and the elderly, and the righteousness, And among them is those who claimed that it is a compound from the navigational, and the discourse is sufficient, and that the diligent, deleted, is the ghost of the inherent, and it is to corruption, and what is revealed to the angels, A kind of magic, and they are only one, but it has come down to the concept of the concept, a house that is the same as the one who said: ؎ To the king, the Qarm and Ibn al -Hamad al -Batt.The elaboration that they teach them what is gathering between his being magic and between his being, descending from the owners of the ablution, and he will be exhausted by their goodness.It may be intended by the argument, and it is another stronger type, so it is from the special kindness of the year a sign of its aspect, and Mujahid said: It is without magic, which is what is separated from it And his husband is not otherwise, and the first famous, and the convergence of kindness on what (Talto), as if it was said: Follow the magic collided in the books, and others, and others, and others To teach the magic in the way of God Almighty for people, whoever knows and does with him disbelief, and whoever learns and stops his work, he will be established on the faith, and for the sake of God, and for the sake of God, and for the sake of God The people of Taltout are open to the river, and a distinction between him and between the miracle, where he has multiplied in that time, and the magic appeared in the affairs of the affairs of the heart, in the affairs of the heart of the heart of the heart, So God sent the high -ranking of the owners To teach the gates of magic, until the likeness of the similarity and the harm of the way, it was said: That was in the time of the administration of peace be upon him.They violated what God has commanded, and they said to him: If we were not disobeying you, he said: They chose two owners of you, so they would be chosen, and they were tied to the land.On the one who is the youth, and it was governed by the people, so we fled with a woman who is said to have a flower, so he asked her and it was forbidden except to worship a word, or to drink, or a murder, So, then I learned from them what I went back to the sky, so I became up and dirty this amazing, and they wanted the elderly, and they could not, and they could not, So they chose the torment of the world, so they are now tortured in it, so that it is not the effects that have been tied and twelve, so the judge has denied it It was mentioned by the people of the news, and it was transmitted by the interpreters in the story of Harbot and Marut, and nothing would return from it, nor the validity of it, or the authenticity of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace It is taken with the measure, and he mentioned in the sea that all of that is not valid from him, and it was not correct that the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, is upon him God Almighty is a disagreement for those who narrated it, and Imam Al -Razi said after he mentioned the narration in that: This novel is a ponded, unnamed, and it is not the same.Whoever is hidden in Harut and Marott is that they are not tortured by their sin with the flower, so it is disbelieving in God, the Almighty, for the angels are not the angels.They are their command and do what they command, and they do not grow up from his worshipers and do not be able And the land, and the saying that it was represented by them, so it was what was, and it was returned to its place other than the reasonable and not acceptable Haban and Al -Bayaki, and others, they narrated it, on the authority of Ali, and Ibn Abbas, Ibn Omar, and Ibn Mas'oud, may God be pleased with them.The stand on her almost cuts her health for her frequent and powerful power, and some investigators went that what was narrated is a story of what he said, and he said, and he is a story of what he said.And his heroes in itself does not contradict the authenticity of the narration, and what the Imam al -Sayouti said to him, but he is returned to those who denounced the kidneys, and perhaps from that The two kingdoms are intended to be the mind and the mind that are from the world The skirt, and from their exposure, has their knowledge of what it prepares, and whoever carries them on the tinkers that they must be mine The desecration of their phenomena, and from its difficulty to the sky with what it learned from them to the highest fullness and mixed with it with the sake of the sake of it They are tortured by their murderers, who are busy with the mobilization of the body, and their deprivation from the elderly to the sky of the urbanization, because the sort of the mind is not the one who does not Whoever said in the solution of this symbol: The spirit and the mind that are among the worlds of the crowds have come from the sky of the ingegence to the land of the attachment, so they loved the body of the body that is the same And the beauty, to stop as their money on it, so I was given the intermediate sins, and the evil, and to obtain the pleasure of the worldly minimum, then the sake of the world, then the sake Their mansion to the tallness of it, then it is dirty that the consequences were cut off and the supporters were separated, and they are tormented by the torment of the sake Painful with spiritual pains of the situation, where he was overwhelmed by the conquest, and the nearby is reflected in the distance, and it was said: the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one that was from that Follow the lust, it was lined up by the angels of the angels, to the dignity of the domain, and whoever is a woman with a lust if she broken her lust and prevailed over her, and she is overwhelmed to her The sky of the homes and the times, and he wrote themselves to his solution: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ And my day is my mother, so I would like to go to my Rams ∗∗∗ the principle of my enemy and the end of my senses.He remains in this sense of this, and whoever says: In the authenticity of this story, the same thing is the same, and he carried it on its appearance.He cries the life, sees the opinion of Islam, and raises the heads of the disbelief, as it is not hidden from the descriptions of the scholars who are achieved, and the son of the son, And Abu al -Aswad, and the laughter (the owners), by breaking the mother, bitten the readers of the conquest of that, so he said: They are a man, except that they are named.And what is said by what was said: They are Dawood and Solomon, and the saying of goodness is returned to him: They are the reasons of the Babel of Iraq, and some of them say: They are among the angels, Carrying the fracture on the conquest on the opposite of what it was presented, and the removal is either on its appearance, or in the sense of the slander in their hearts, (in the door), with the meaning of me, and it is in the meaning of me, With a deletion, he signed a state of the two owners, or from the guerrilla In the descent, and it is as Ibn Abbas said, and Ibn Masoud, may God be pleased with them, said: a country in the darkness of the kufa, and it was said: Babel Iraq, and he said: It is from Nasib.It was said: The mountain of Damuand, and it was said: a country with the Maghreb, and the famous day, the second day, and when some are the first, it was said: I was called Pabil, so that it is the same He explained Namoud, and he brought the Dinwari in the sitting, and Ibn Asakar from the way of Naam ibn Salim, and he is accused of Anas ibn Malik, who said: “No He sent them a honest and western wind, and a kiss and a sea, so they collected them to Babel, so they gathered a day, then they looked at what they have, so they did not.Westering about his right and the righteous from his journey, and he is confronted to the forbidden house in his face, so he has the words of the people Qahtan ibn Houd, you are, so it was the first to speak to the Arabian, so the call is still calling for those who did so and so, so he is so and so, so that they are so And seventy of the tongue, the voice was cut off, and the elderly turned, so I called the door, and the tongue was on the basis of Babeli, and I am in the saying of the two, but the one, but the one, but To him that the Babel is a domain name, as the father of Hayyan stipulated that there is no Arab, as he indicates to him the words of the fearful, and that in the original, there is a name for the righteousness of the great, And I have been given to that land for the closeness of the Furat from them, and perhaps that before the name of the name of Baghdad, the house I know it today in any book, and I think it is close to what I mentioned, so let him preserve, and prevent some of them pray Al -Bayahqi in his Sunnah, “On the authority of Ali, the Exalted of God, the Almighty, is that my love, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, The chain of transmission of this hadith is an article, and I do not know one of the scholars who forbade prayer with it, and it is similar to that if the hadith proves that it is forbidden to take it as a mother, then it is a mother, then it is a mother.In it, and this is in the matter of commenting in the knowledge of the Bayan, or perhaps the prohibition is for him in particular, not to see he said: We are forbidden, and the same is an other hadith: (Nahni).That is a warning of it with what was found in that way, Harut and Marut It was said: Two Arabs from the Haret and the Bitter in the sense of the fracture, and their name was before: Ajaz, and his glory, so when the righteousness of the sin is called, and it is formed from it.Scientific, and some of them cost him that it is enticed to be said: They are nomadic from the city and the passers -by, and the blockade of justice in the murdered weight is as well Al-Hasan and Al-Zahri by raising them on the fact that the stance is Harut and Marut, and what the wonder makes from what the Imam al-Qaribbi said: that Harbut and Marott (P-343) (P-343) The readings of tension, (and what) in and what was revealed is navigational, and what is meant by the king is Gabriel and Michael, because the efforts were claimed that God Almighty revealed them with the magic And the last, and the ability: and the disbelief of Solomon, and what was revealed to the owners, but the demons are Harbot and Marott, they disbelieved, they teach the people of the magic, and the magic is the way.Some of all, and we have to be mentioned to their repetition, and to be a head in the teaching, or the replacement of each of each, either by building that the gathering is on the authority of the whole, They are two emotions of two tribes of the demons, and they were not in this row, and I am surprised by his saying, this is his saying: and this is what he did.Tawil and correct what was said in it, and do not fulfill what it has, and it is not hidden from every fairness that he does not want a believer who carries the words of God, and he is in the highest It is less than that, and it is nothing but a copy of the book of God Almighty, the glory of his affairs, and his frustration for him from his affairs, and the spoilers of the lack of goods are not, and it was said: People are special, Harot and Marut, and the negation is the negation.And what we know is from one until they say, but we are a temptation.He learned from us and did with him disbelief, and whoever you know and find out of faith, (do not disbelieve) with his disbelief and the permissibility of doing it with it, and it was said: Do not know.Until it is atoned, and it is built on my opinion that the magic is a voicing, and it is seduced, and whoever believes in his right is atone, (and from) from the sake of the To benefit the affirmation of the darkening, and the individuality of the temptation with the number of the experienced for it to be a source, and the bearing is a collide of the vagina, and the slander is that it is for the sake They take it as a matter of others, so that the people will know about its learning, (and even) for the language, and it was said: in the sense of only, and the total in the place of the monument is on the right ( And it is clear that the saying is once, and the saying is that it is three, the seventh, or a nine that is not proven, and it is different in how the knowledge of the knowledge is not.It is one of them, one of them, but two years are different from them.They refer to the learning with themselves at the time of the abusers, and the closeness is that they are not when that on the royal image, and what was brought out by Ibn Jarir, and the son of Abu Hakim, And Al -Bayaki in his Sunnah on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that she said: (A woman came to me from the family His death, you ask him about something in which you entered from the matter of magic, and you did not work with it, she said: I had a husband who was absent from me, and I entered it, and I was on the authority of it You did what I commanded, I made it to come to you, so when the night came to me with two calaters, I ran over one of them, and I rode the other, and the other, and it was not, If I am two men suspended by their legs, they said: What came to you?So go to that enlightenment, and I was in it, until I said: So I went and I walked in it, so I went to a horse, who is in the same way.So I came to them, and I mentioned to them, and they said: You believed, that is your faith came out of you, so go, and you will not want anything unless it was), the news of his height, then he is what he said Those who are from the stories in this section, which is not dependent on the doors of the doors, and the feet of the likeness of such a woman who is the one who is the one who is in the authority This is the story in which nothing is valid for the Messenger of the Lord of the Lord, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The sane person believes it, even if it was the relief of dreams, and he was inferred from the verse of those who have learned the magic, and it was directed that there is a sign of the struggle They are their silence, and learning is a lot of it, but they are limited to the same self-esteem by advertising like the positive (P-344) and the obligatory, and it is not hidden that there is no significance in it, Because that learning was for the abuse and the distinction, as we came, and those who say the prohibition were mentioned: if the magic learns, if it is imposed, then it will be broken, and it will be broken in His corruption for them, to return to the right, is not forbidden, as it does not prohibit the regret for the text of the man Launching the saying about it, and whoever says: Harbut and Marut are from the demons.With it, it is not like that in that, so it is atoned, and then I do not lend originally, and what we mentioned is that the saying on the way of the advice is in this way, and it is It is on the way of mockery, not advice, and it is the most appropriate In the case of the demons, and read the authority of Bin Marsaf (knowing) by lowering the media, and on it, some of them carried the readings of the tension, and read the father of the Some of them are overwhelmed by the exile sentence, because it is in the power of the stabilized, as if he said: They teach them after that saying, and they will learn, and they will not know.The advertisement, as the father of Ali was delusional from the words of Al -Zajaj, and his kindness to them (know) is deleted, and some of them (they come), as well He (one) is the one who is the people, or for anyone, carrying it in the sense, as it is in the words of the high So the reference of the destiny is then a phenomenon, and it was said: In the words, it is deleted, that is, they learn, so you will be a sentence that is a premium of what is given to it.The name is on the verb, and we are attributed to his Sibuyeh, and not good, and Adam (from them) is a good one Finitah and magic, and compassion (they learn) on (teach), and hold (what we know) on the negation, (until he says) on the affirmation of him, that is, he does not know.He ended him until he said, etc.Infidel), and he is as you see, what they separate from the woman and his wife, that is, who, or something, separated from it, which is the magic that is removed with the way of the path of the Lord, The two sites, the signed of the abundance and the obligatory arguments for the separation between them, and it was said: What is meant is what separates it for the disbelief, because it is a disbelief, because if he learned He married him, or if he learns to do, and people will be seen, and they believe that he is a right, and they will atone, and they will show their waves, and the man is the man, and the man is clear.The annexation was reacted as a divorce, and the follower was narrated to the movement of the Arabs, and the femininity of the woman, and his collection came with wow and noun, and they said: The vision, and the Zawj: It is here the relative and the naughty brother, and from it from every young man with a foolishness, and those who have been wronged, who were wronged, and they have read the good and the flower, and the murdered (the one) Ishaq (the woman) is to be guaranteed by the mood with the prodigy, and the lustful is fracture and prodigy, and it was narrated from the good, and the Zahri also read (the bitter) with the conquest, and it is the conquest, With his harm to one of the guilts of the magic of those who have returned to them (and they are learning), and it was said: To the Jews who have returned to them, and they have come to them, and they are.And a pioneer with him is a good (for what), (and from) an increase in the exile of the negation as if it was said: and what they harm him one, Al -Amash (my harmful) read the deletion of the noun, and it was removed from the fact that it was lowering, and if the name of the actor is not a link, then the text of the son of Malik was lost For his saying: We are wearing us, if you come to my grocery, so that you are not that we are not able to speak and say them: a scatter of your whiteness, and the white of it, An estimated deletion of his saying: Oh, Tam Tam is a nomad, in one of the faces, and it was said: to add to one of the parts of the neighbor, part of it, and the part of it (P-345) He is heard, as in his saying: ؎ They are a brother in the war who does not take it ∗∗∗ If he feared a day a cabinet, then he called them and the choice of that zamhuri, and in it, and in it, and in it that The pilgrim is not something, because it is influenced by it, the part of the thing is in it, and it is also the chapter between the two of the people, and the one who is the same Abu Hayyan said, and this is a way out of this.With a deletion, he was signed at a state of guerrilla (harmful) or from his acting, which is the one Here is the abuse between the enchanting and the freedom of magic, the good said, and there is an indication that there is a deposited harm, if God wants to be exalted, there is no one between him, and he will be between him, and if he wills, and if he wills, and if he wills, and if he does not, then he wills The predecessor is gone in the paths of the causes and causes, and it was said: The ears in the sense of the matter, and it is permitted by the formation of those who are formed by the relationship The universe of the doves are taught to it, so it is the denial of the cores influenced by its own The science, and there is no sign of it to the negative effect of the same as the first two.And they learn what harm them because they intend to do with the work with a firm intention, and the intent of disobedience as well The work of evil, which is the whims of the soul, the form of the one who is in the first place, and for the second one, and the second, (and does not benefit them).A pure and frequent freedom, not like some of the harms, with the benefit and rhetoric, because they do not mean to dismiss it from the abuse of the lies of magic, nor the ritual of the harm, and the ritual of the harm is from the harm.There is a benefit in the sentence, and in the two (without) indicating that it is not useful in the two house For those who are heard while he is a martyr, about his use, and a burning of motivation from him, and some of them were married to be (not benefiting them) on It is it, so it will be in the position of raising, and the waw will be for the situation, and its weakness is not hidden, and they have taught them to be attached to the saying of the Almighty: Recorder in the between, so the guarantee is for those of those who are, and it was said: The guerrilla of the Jews who were on the covenant of Soliman, peace be upon him, and said: So do not disbelieve, and he brought the gathering of collection on the saying of those who see that, for whom I have waged, that is, what will be replaced by what the devils are in the book of God, and the blame for the sake Mudaraa, and its entry into the past with many, and it is obedient to it, and on the beginning of the beginning, if it is presented to him and on the work of the news, if it is done, if it is located.They make it in all the answer to the estimated division, and not in the existence of them with a mother, as he refers to it as the words of the one who is satisfied, and it was suspended here (knowledgeable) In transcendence of a verb, or two effective, from a beginner connection, and his prayer, and his saying, is the Almighty: What he has in the hereafter from the creation of a sentence) Much in the beginning, (and in the hereafter) is attached to what the news is related to, or a state of the guarantor in it, or from its reference, and the creation of the share, it is said, and the one said, or the one said, or the one said, or the one said, Abbas, may God be pleased with them, or the destiny, said by Qatada, and from him saying: ؎ So I have a house for the tall ∗∗∗ and what you have in the majority of the creation (P-346) said: It is used in goodness, and it will be for the evil of a few, and the father of the survival went on to the individuals until the lam is slow to the division, (and from) the condition of it (and the condition of it) He has), etc., the answer to the division, and the condition of the condition is deleted, it is upon him, because if a division and conditional is gathered, their predecessors must be prevalent, and it is in it that is what is in it, because it is in it.He said at the condition of (who) here is that it is not a conditional position, and the father of Hayyan directed him that the verb is a past, and it is not, because the one is not a matter It is valid, because the condition of the condition, if it is a past, is not possible, then it is necessary to be an accepted meaning, and the satisfaction of the satisfaction is in: a good man, that the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first, that the first is the first The appetite is useful for affirmation, and the oath is not valued as the keff did, because the origin is the number of estimation, and the affirmative is required of the division, and the division is from the division, A certainty for the first or an increase is what is hardly correct, but the first is because it is to build the word if it is on one letter that is not confused, but with the baptism Al -Radhi was included, and the second is because the bodies are the increase in the neighbor's lame, and it is broken in the phenomenon.And by the misery of what they have been misled by themselves, the pain in which there is no mother, as well, and the famous is the answer to the division, The sentence is given to the first division, (and) is a distinctive denial of the vague guarantee, in the misery, and the one who is devoted to the omit The phenomenon is the phenomenon, that is, by God, the misery of something that they have been well -known for themselves The magic or the infidelity, if they knew any defamatory, the purchase of the purchase of it, they would not be forbidden, and do not contradict the proof of knowledge for them, for the first, for the first, and for the second, The stabilization of them is the strange mind, and the exile from them is the gain that is from the term of the mandate, or because the first is the knowledge of the sentence, and the second is the knowledge, the knowledge is the knowledge of the For example, the ugliness of the thing, then he does not know that his action is ugly, as if they knew that the breath of the soul with magic is a defam The sentence of that ugly, or because they knew the punishment, and they did not know its truth, and its intensity, or because the words are out of the revelation of the scholar, and the one who is the one Something is a house of its numbers, because it is a fruit, where they did not work with their knowledge, or on the download of the scientist with the exaggeration of the news, and it is necessary to do so.His saying: If they had known with it, if they had knowledge of that law, they would not be forbidden from it, that is, they have no knowledge, so they do not believe, and this is the one who does not, The science is that this news, if it was imposed as its being, is loyal to them, so there is no meaning for their being, two scholars, with its guarantee, how are you, and it is true, That they have knowledge of it, and after the one who is not meaningful to download them, the ignorance of the ignorant, that they have no knowledge that those who have been shared by what he has in the last, if there is no one, if only They are revealed by the ignorance of the ignorant of that they have knowledge of that, and it is answered from it: either first, because the speech is clear to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Second, that the one who has learned from and has known the knowledge of them is a right to them, and it is beneficial from the news that is given to them, the knowledge of the knowledge of them, and there is no contradiction, and there is no contradiction, and there is no contradiction, The scientist, if he did the difference of his knowledge, is a scholar that he is the ignorant house in the number of the arrangement of the fruit of his knowledge, and this science is required to be given a reason for you, so that it is a matter The scholars are in it that they have no knowledge, and that they are in the ignorant house in that purchase, and this science is required that they refrain from it, and if they did not give it a person, they would not be forbidden, and they are not.On the basis of this knowledge, then the news was thrown to them that they have no knowledge with their knowledge of it, such as it was said, and the intensity of it is not hidden from the severity It is contradictory that it is an effective (they know) what was indicated by (for a good evening), etc.The hereafter, and the knowledge that we do not have the right to the hereafter.The formation of the bound is removed from the forefront in the last, with the knowledge of the knowledge of it, as it is reprehensible.Average (know) is deleted, that is, they have known that he is harmful to them and does not benefit them, (and for those who bought it) is associated with the first story, and the one (Laqim) I wage it) very much, and with a smile, it will be bought, and the payment of the inconsistency was paid that it was the first knowledge of what they worse The world, because the misery of the general ablution, the exile, the knowledge of the absolute misfortune, means that if they knew his harm in religion and the world, they would not be forbidden, but they are forbidden.That the stabilizer is first knowledge that what they have erected in the hereafter is a share of it, not that they have made them misled by them, and they brought it out of their hands, but they were in the whole, but they were in the whole, but they were in the whole, but they are the same The prophets intercede for them in the last, and the exile is this science that does not hide what is in it, but first because the general defamation is in misery, and if it is said to him, but it is for it to be in it Its soul is without exposure to the elderly and the possibility, and the commitment that does not deviate from a darkening, and secondly, it is that the share is allocated with it, with it, with it, with it, with it, with it.The context of the argument for the elimination of what does not call for it except the narrowness of the gift, and the answer by returning the guerrilla (know) to the people, or the devils, (and for those who are bought) To dismantle from other than a warning to it, there is no clear consort that indicates it, and after every first account when I am in the answer, as the words of the words are out of the word This is provided in the Glorious Book, and the domains that were mentioned before the sewers of the words are in it on the necessity of the phenomenon that do not leave in the interior of anything.
