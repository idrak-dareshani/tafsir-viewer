The Quranic researcher is the lion and is called the Surah al -Assad, and it is an angel, and any of the five is without disagreement in the two things.And when he mentioned his chains while he entered the people in the religion of Islam, he was punished by the masculinity of some of those who did not enter it.؎ On his soul, so let him have a lifetime and have no share of it from it, and there is no arrow as it was said in the face of communication, and it was said: It is from the connection of the one who is happy and in the good And peace, and the imam said in that: He is the Almighty when he said: You have a debt and a debt, so that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “My God, so what is my part?” And God Almighty said: You have victory and conquest, and he said: “What is the part of my uncle who called me to the worship of idols?” He said: He turned his hand.The promise was presented to the return (P-260) to be the victory, connected to the words of the Almighty: I have a debt and the bounty is back to his saying: “You have a debt of your religion The verse...So this homosexuality is contemplated between this surrounding, with the surah of victory from the last of what we descended in the city, and it is from what we have come to.It was composed by God Almighty and his command, glory, and then he said: And another direction; It is that when he said: You have a debt of religion, as if it was said: God is what is the reward of the obedient?He said: The victory and the conquest.Then it was said: What is the part of the disobedient?He said: The loss is in the world and the punishment in the punishment, as it was indicated by Surah Tabt.He ended as he was seen.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful They want the mother of a hook from the pyramid and miracle; That is: I was lost as Ibn Abbas and Ibn Omar said, and from the first, she was also disappointed, and on the authority of Yaman ibn and Thab: it was zero from all the best and it is on the authority of the sailor.Al -Shahab said: The material of the chapters is taking place on the piece and it leads to destruction; So he was interpreted.Al -Raghib said: He is the one who is the one in the loss, and the recipient was included.My father is a flame, he is Abd al -Uzi ibn Abd al -Muttalib, the uncle of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The collection of the ritual of the megarius said: “We are in the market with a metaphor if I am a man of the hadith of the Sunnah, he says: O people, say there is no god but God, and they will be fulfilled, His legs and his arms and say: O people, he is a liar, so do not believe him, so I said: Who is this?His uncle is a flame of flame that claims that he is a liar." Imam Ahmad and Al -Sheikh brought out from Ibn Abbas, he said: “When I came down: and the closest of your clan warned The Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, pursued the locking, so he called: “O sons of a vase, O sons of my enemy.” To be a Quraysh until they gathered, and he made the man if he could not go out, send a messenger to look I told you that a horse in the valley wants to be tempted by you.They said: Yes; We did not leave you only.He said: "I am a vow to you among the hands of a severe torment." And Abu Lahab said: You have a walk to the days of the days, why did you collect us?So she went down.And the like of what was presented, and his chain of transmission to his hands, as well as from what Al -Bayhaqi narrated in the evidence of Ibn Abbas, also that Abu Lahab said when he came out of the people Muhammad prepares our things that we do not see as a being; Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.They are their own.Al -Farah said: The first is a supplication with the inhabitants of his sentence on the fact that the hands are either as a severity of the self and the soul because of the necessity in the sentence, or a metaphor of the sake of the part of the part.The costume of the Sunnah, and the saying in his response is that it is involved in all of it.With his disagreement here, and in his words, the Almighty: Do not cast your hands to the consent or what is meant by what was said by that condition, it is a right or a ruling in the ruling, as well And the hand on the one who is the one.And he obtained the saying of the jam: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ As the son of Masoud was read by him.This reader is obeyed to be a supplication; Business is tired of hands mostly.The second is a news about the destruction of itself.And in the interpretation of the hand in the sense of the blessing, and it was good for the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and to Quraysh and say: If the matter is for Muhammad, then it is for him, and if he is a lord, then he is the one who is lying So, he was told that he had lost his hand that was at the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.Quraysh and their destruction in the hand of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, so this is the meaning: my father will become a flame.What is meant by the second is the same as its own, and it is mentioned in its destruction, and I wanted to teach it with the invitation of the bad, and that it is the same In the month of his knowledge, he woke up with that.And that supports the readings of those who read: “The father of a flame” is as it was said to me, the son of Abu Taleb and Mua’awah ibn Abu Sufyan; If nothing will be changed from it, then it will be formed from the poison, or for the remembrance of the remembrance of his name Al -Qabih, or because it was as it was narrated from a fighter that he would have to do so, and he would be so So he reminded of that insulting him and his launch with that, or for a bastard embryo and agrees with it.And the saying is that it is not a discretion that it is not in the faction, and it is an illusion; They did not involve him in it or to make him a none of the hell, as it was said: He died in Hell, and that is because the father is to be affiliated with the father of the father.His clothes for him and his mandate, as it is said: He is the father of good, the father of evil, the brother of the best, and the brother of the war for those who wear these things, and the obligatory It is necessary to be a paradise, for a nose By reflecting on the choice of the two opinion in the Kniyah; The obligatory between them in the sentence is achieved in the outside and the delicacy, except that this is obligatory, but it is according to the first place.The original suffering.Abu Lahab, with the adoption of the scientific position, is used in the appointed person, and he will move from it by adopting his original place to the sake of the flame, and the mandate of it.It is a severity of the adjective in mediation, and this is what the second science has chosen, because it has a none, without a median, because it is the original meaning of me, I mean the hearts of the God, with no With the mark because a father is used in the appointed person and speaking on their own, their original suffering in Al -Kanni is transmitted from it to the meaning of the meaning Al -Jahni, and it is not noticed with it with its original meaning The piety of its formation is not the same as the synthesis of the group, and what was said: The realistic meaning is not intended in Al -Kiniyah, and that the abundant and the righteous.And here is the intention of the inspired self, so it is not something; Because the kinna is noticeable, I want it to be with it with the permissibility of his will with him, so it is permissible for us to be both meanings.In the key, it is permissible that what is meant in the kiniyah is the real meaning and its all is still, and the master claimed also that the kinna in my father is a flame, because it is famous for that Hell, and his name was replaced by his hell, a sign of a hill that is a horse.It is necessary for him to be the same as the likeness of the person with that knowledge of that science, and not as well, then they will move from the nickname to what is the same The origin is from otherwise standing on the month.His father (P-262) that he has after it.Ibn Muhaisn and Ibn Katheer read: “My father is a flame” by the distraction of the distraction, and it is from the change of flags on what is in the scouts.Abu al -Baqa said: The conquest and the homing are two languages, and it is a measure on the kefy gold.
