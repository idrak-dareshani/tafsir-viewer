The Quranic researcher is a lot of the people of the book, and they are a group of incense of the Jews.Our religion, it is better for you, the one who narrated it from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, and narrated that Finjas ibn Azuraa, and Zayd ibn Qais, said: May God be pleased with him from a long hadeeth, the preservation of the son of Hajar was mentioned that he was not found in anything from the books of the hadith, if they would return to you, a story Speech on (if) this, so I sing about the return after your faith as disbelief, that is, the two people, which is one of the guerrillas (P-357) who addresses, it supports the comparison of the disbelief The infidelity is obtained by the extension of the extension with the severity of the view of what it responds to, and therefore it is not said that if they return you to the infidelity, and it is permissible to be a state of one) It is a second effective (to return you) on the guarantee of the response, the meaning of the formation, as some of them do not disbelieve until it is returned to it, so he needs to be in the way of being in the We are full of that in this is the disbelieving disbelief with the exclusive way, and it is entered into the heaven, and in the saying of the Almighty: (from after) with that the phenomenon (from) is the one who is the one who does (from) By obtaining faith for them, and it was said: A mediator is repeated to the convergence of the fullness of the hamper of what they wanted, and the purpose of its distance from the fall is either for the increase of the sacrifice of the sacrifice His prestige, or for the faith of faith for him, as if it was said: After your faith, the righteous, and in it from the provisions of the believers, what is not hidden, the grace of the heart) Because they want to increase their divorced, and do not increase them with the envy, and they have been married to be a source of the case in the case, that is, the envious, and it is not a matter of it Weak, because making the source immediately as the father of Hayyan said, it is not measured, and it was said: It is permissible to be based on the source, and the work in which it is deleted, that is, the one who is omitted.Virtue, which is as you see, from themselves attached to a deleted, and a liquid, either for envy, that is, the envy of the origin of their soul It is an ethnic exaggeration, and this confirms the matter of obedience if it is made to multiply, or the glorification, or for the concept of the concepts of (friendly), that is Self, and desire them, not by the displacement and the inclination to the right, and make it a custody of a work (a hand) or a envy, as it was transferred from the one, as it is transferred from the They use a word (from) as Ibn al -Shujari said after what it was clear to them the right to the core of the one who is mentioned in the miracle, and the miracles, and this is like the ritual With the ink, because the show is with that, but it was To them, not for the ignorant, and perhaps whoever said: Al -Waddah is also one of them, so that their religion is not overwhelmed, who inherited it, and the pillar of their inks will be invalidated, Feasings, so what is meant by many of their disbelievers and their hypocrites, and its remembrance is to be a breakthrough of those who believe in a secret and a glory that claims that the one who has the same Also, its causes are different and varying, and this is the one who is overwhelmed by the suspicion, because whoever witnessed the brilliant miracles, and the noble verses of it as a distance from it, as it was The right to the truth, the knowledge of the sects of the sincerity, except that the fortunes of the religious, the worldly lusts and the Satanic arguments are the ones who made the veil of the faith, and the one who has gone away from the faith I restricted in the restriction of the mutation, so forgive and forgive the pardon, leave the punishment of the sinner, and the forgiveness is left to be installed and repeated, and it is the most abundant of the pardon The human being, and does not forgive, and perhaps it is taken from the pharmacy of the face of the face as symptoms, or from the annexes of the jurisprudence if you passed away from it, and the effect of the pardon of them, and the effect of the pardon of them.You can betray the believers for the disbelievers.Until God comes with his command, he is one of the people, and what is meant by the matter is to fight by saying his praise: Furdish those who do not believe in God, or the one who does not believe The killing of a Quran, and the evangelization of the children of Al -Nadir, and it was said: One of the affairs, what is meant by the resurrection, or the reward on its day, or the power of the message, and the many of the nation, and the abundance of the nation, Safeh with symptoms of them, and leaving their mixtures, and made the absence of pardon, the verse of the fighting, and the symptoms of God, God Almighty, and his goodness, and his goodness of peace The dog is, and it is not something because it is necessary for the matter to be carried on one of the tamers, and the one who is a matter of things, and it is when the investigators are gathered, and the one who is the one, and the one who is the one, and the one who is the one, and the one who is the one, And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them: The verse is forgotten by the verse of the sword, and it is formed (P-358), that is that the transcription is to be the same as the way The street, and a payment of the phenomenon of the appetite for the release of the lineage to us, requires that the woven judgment be free from the vengeance and the people, for the time, for the time, for it was not.The copyist has a bite of the lineage to us as well, and if it was a prestigious, it was a start, not a bay, the lineage to the street, and the matter is here, it is affected by the absence, and it is not.That the verse of the fighting is a place for its inclusion, and that is the weakness of what the Imam al -Razi answered, and follow it in it, many of the ones that the end that is suspended if it is not related Under that the newborn was not removed from being a transcriber, and a place is dissolved, so forgive and forgive until it is copying it for you, so this is not the same as his saying Exalted: Then you complete the fast until the night, and the goodness of the good for him with the judgment of the deeds and the Gospels, because he mentioned in them the end of the time of the ruling of the ruling With the grace of his words, the Almighty: Those who follow the mother of the illiterate prophet who find it written in them in Al -Tawara and Al -Najil, and it was the one who has the same He greeted copying, and he returned to him what is in Al -Talwih that the location in them is the evil of the Prophet, may Godâ€™s prayers and peace be upon him The rulings are for the sake of the return to him by adopting his being an infidel, or a reporter, or a substitute for each other without some, so whoever is the same It is divorced, and it is understood from it, so it is a copy of it, and it is answered by the questioning that it is not far from it.It is said: Perhaps their knowledge is easy to meet with their deaths or by the rise of the hour, and perpetuation, but it contradicts the release of judgment, if it is an absence of the ritual, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, and if it is for the sake, and if it is if it is, And the copy is in it at the gathering, it is said by our salleic Mawladi, except that the phenomenon does not help him, so he managed.God for everything is destined to be sure of what he understood from his prime, and there is a notice of righteousness from the infidels, and a promise to the believer, After that, it is a remembrance of the acceptance of his command with pardon and forgiveness, and threw up for those who violate his matter,
