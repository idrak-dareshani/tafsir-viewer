The Quranic researcher is the opening of the book in it, so they are more than an angel, but rather from the parents of the Qur’an, which is the narrator, and it is the one who is on the authority of Ali And the most companions, and on the authority of Mujahid that it is a civilian, and it has been separated with that, until it is a matter The kiss was transformed, to know that it is in the prayer as it was, and it was said: Some of it is an angel and some are a civilian, and his weakness is not hidden, and the people of the people have been hidden from the people In the verse of the stone: And we have given you seven of the second and the great Qur’an and it is an angel of the text of the scholars and the narration from Ibn Abbas, and it has no ruling, and there is no ruling for it In the right of the people of Mecca as it was said, because it is based on the fact that the angel was not in the right of the people of Mecca, the famous of its disagreement, and the strongest of the righteous from the ritual They witnessed the revelation and the download, because that is a first place for the interpretation of the second seven with the conquest, and it is if it is correct in the hadiths, except that it is true He is a homes and otherwise its interpretation of the seventh long, and secondly on the abuse of the two who are given to the distress before his gossip with the fact that God Almighty has blessed God and may God bless him and grant him peace With matters before his giving to you, as he said: “We open up for you, and it is clear, and it is before the conquest in the years, and the abbrection is for the past The disagreement of the phenomenon, especially with the revenue of the mother, and the word (may), and its coldness in the exposure of the time, and the dominant in it is the precedent of the fall, and the kindness: and do not give it to you.However, it was not said that this is not said: This is not indicated that it was descended with Mecca, and as for the negation of its descent in the city (P-33) The negation is the original, and on the prosecutors of the confirmation and that I am, and what they said in the answer to the symptoms that the descent is an appearance from the world of the unseen to the testimony, and the appearance of it is not.The appearance of the appearance of the heroes, as the case of the pretext that it was in every one for a sake, or that it was on a letter again and another other for the (money) With a lame, and a bodies, and with it, the doctrine and the narratives are correct to the fall of the fall, which is not obligatory, as it is not hidden, and the surah is not a matter.It was one of the seams, which is the rest, because the rest of everything is some of it, and it is his beginning if it is from the wall of construction, which is the house or the wall of the city, to surround it.It is the high and the rush to reiterate it as the words of God Almighty, and the house is called the ravine, as in the saying of the nap About it, it is lying down A Qur’an that includes a light and a rhetoric, and it was said: an independent sect, to come out of the verse of the Karsi, exaggerated, and the name of the whole has been established, He who said in his hatred to be said: Surah is like this, but a surah is mentioned in it, such as this, based on what was narrated from Anas and Ibn Omar from the forbidden of that Mawzal, and the hadith of Ibn Omar is on the authority of it, and if it was narrated from it with a true bond, and the conqueror in the original is a row that made it either for the first thing, for the first thing, So all, and the time to move, or the exaggeration, and does not take it with a garden of a mark or a source that was released on the first to be called a name, with a name, with the ritual of the rhetoric, As if the soul of the conquest, as he attached it to him first, then by his midst, he is attached to the group to form a part of it, and it is said in the end, so it is in the absence, so it is in the absence, and it is in the absence, The last is first, and all of it is in its midst, and this is not the first for a few effective in the sources, except that it is first of his being for the family, or a source, because this is a matter And a comparison of it, and the majority is that the machine does not describe, and the emitter is not compared, because the machine is here it is not appropriate for it to be deluded that some be uninterrupted, and they are not.For the proportions, that is, the same opening, with the faces of the other, ((and the book) is the person of the person, and the conquest of the conquest of the measure to it, not to the destiny, and the one who is in the destiny, and the sake of the destiny.It is achieved in the knowledge, the inspiration, or the house of pride, so it is not a harm in the feasibility of the surah in this name in the first, and the first addition of the addition of the name to the name, which is the name, which is the name, which is the name, The mother is as in the part of the thing, not in the sense of (from), as in the conclusion of a silver because the added is a part of the old woman, and it is some of the sake of Islam, and he said: The part in the sense (from) the whiteness, but rather in the luminous and its explanation: from the estimated in the addition, it is divorced, as well In partiality, it is divorced, and some of them were in general, and the privileged privacy as in the example, and made it in the divorce as the city of Baghdad, and it is not.And for this generous surah is the names that some are reached to a nose and ten years, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is its principle on the path of the righteous, not because it is in the time The learning, and in the reading in the prayer, as the imam al -Sayuti claimed it, nor because it was the first surah that came down as it was said, but the first and the third is because the principle is from the principle of You call for the observance of the synchronization in the rest of the parts of the book from your two, and there is no doubt that the learning and the Nazouli are not as well as the second I knew (P-35) That the one who is intended is not the right, the righteous, the righteous, is what is read in the prayer until it is considered a name for it, and it was mentioned in the name of it Because it is the first surah that was written in the wave, and it needs a transfer, and if it is correct that it is the formation of the Qur’an, which is in our Qur’an, as in the Loop, then it is the same The one who is the one who is the dominance of the suspicion is another matter, (and the second) is the opening of the Qur’an, because we did the example of the calf with the slander, (and its third and its lords) the mother of the book and the mother of the Qur’an: They say one of you, the mother of the book, and to say: the opening of the book), “I do not pray for it, but it has been established in the chapter, its name is called it, as it is not hidden from the one who has been hidden from you The appetite is a book, a recitation, or a descent on a saying or a prayer in it, and after that it is followed, it is like the mother who forms the child after her, and it is said to the mother, and it is also said to the mother: To present it and follow the army for it, and it is the mother of the villages, or to disobey it as the science said on the purposes of the suffering in the Qur’an from the praise of God, and it is the one who is God.With the matter and the forbidden, and from the return, the praise is back, and the worship is from the praise of God because it is for the knowledge, so it is valid for the affairs of the affairs On the authority of the sentence in the sentence, and we do not see it in it, or from the guidance of the straight path, if I want the religion of Islam, or from the estimation of the people, and from the name of God, and from the name of God.Either from you worship, it is a news about his specialization with worship, and it is the fulfillment of the slaves of the arms of what the master commanded or forbidden, and it is forbidden, and it is not permissible, and it is not permissible.He responds to the dismissed, the precedent of the precedent and the origin of the origin, and it is obligatory for us after the numbers of the pronouncement of the first of the servants, and in the righteousness of the servants, and in the righteousness, and in the righteousness To him, not, and may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him On them other than the angry, or from the Day of Religion, that is, the penalty, and the rewarding either what is easy or what is harmful, and they are the reward and the punishment, but it was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is And the books are removed from the servants, and a guidance to what they reconcile with a pension, and a return, and that is with the knowledge of those who are able to communicate the blessings, and a supply, then the one who is more The bid is, and the increased is action, and the purpose of what is led by it to the return of the attribute, and the prevention of the assault with hearts and bodies, and the one who is a bodies, and the one who is the one.He has with him with the investigator, and the definition enter the ranks of the majesty and the beauty, and with what is from the transmission, the landing and the devotion between the obedience, and the sinner, and the faith, so the faith is in The prophecies and the hostile to the busts, and the worship can be able to communicate and communicate, and enter into it from the face of faith in the prophets, and what is attached to it, and what is attached to it, And the end is the rumor of the confirmation of that in the sentence, and the promise and the return include faith in the restoration, and they are sent to worship, and people like a hundred camels, and there is no one in it, and there is no one in it.They were sent by desire and dread, and their mediators are hopeful and fearful, and the properties and a little are what people and the hibernation are, for the three of the guidance, the guidance was made to the place of the pension The face of this is this, so the masculinity is a breadth, and you are to return the three to two, so the praise is perpetuated in worship, as there is no judgment, and it is not true.To him, he is all, until the thanks of the blessing is a mind, observing the delayed deeds, and the goodness did not accept that, so he crossed with what he crossed, or from the authority, or from the authority, Its suffering from the theoretical wisdom, the ruling of the operation that is the righteous paths of the path, and the view of the pricing of the pricing, the homes of the hardships, and the first (P-36) (P-36).The surah is to his saying: The Day of Religion and the second is from his saying: We do not worship and after it, and your peaceful path On them, etc., in which there is a promise and a return, so they entered it, and the proverbs and the stories that are intended with the preacher, as well as the supplication and the blessing, and this is the sentence of the Qur’an.It is more simplified by this that it is said: It is a disgrace to four types of the sciences that are the areas of religion, (the first) the knowledge of the origins, and its handicapped is the knowledge of God.With his saying: The Lord of the Merciful, the Most Merciful, and the knowledge of the prophets, and it is intended with his saying, the Almighty: You have been blessed with them and the mummy to him.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so the branches threatened to reach, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the prayer is to the presence of al -Samadiyyah The fee is in the homes of these high ranks, and the signal is by saying: And we seek help from the righteous, the righteous (the lord), the knowledge of the one) Salaf Al -Da’i and Al -Ashqaya, and what is connected to it from the promise and the return, and it is what is meant by the words of the high You came in simplified of that, and these two sacrifices are calling for the book of the book on the suffering, or its appreciation in the installation The additional, and the first face does not require it, and from this, the bone was made, and if it is more accurate and more beautiful, not because it is formed on them what he responded to that the conqueror is the same It is proven that the bulls are not equal to detail, so the increase in its buildings is a three -third of the reward.Inclusion, and commitment, and they are the third of the connotations, and I say: the most surprising of this is the most merciful of God, with what Dilmi narrated in the Farda from Abu al -Darwah: It is permissible for something that is not rewarded from the Qur’an, even if the opening of the book was made in the palm of the balance, and the Qur’an was made in the other palm, it was preferred to be the fatwa of the Qur’an.Mitteries, because he is not dismissed from him except for the reward in the reward, so he will oppose his appearance that news of his success, and on the face of the owner, the owner of the said, does not contradict it, Exclusivity between the two experts, and with it the forms goes away by the fact that the first was the first and the multiplicity of rewards secondly, nor a stone on the wide mercy, or that the disagreement of the state is the case, or that it is the case of the state of The whole thing is amended by its thirds, or by the Qur’an in one of the two experts or in them in the sense of prayer, the same is the same in his saying: The Qur’an is the Qur’an that was the Qur’an.Thus, it is different from being dismissed by the paths of people in their readers and their prayers, so he should be managed, and on the ills, they are not measured by what was said in the face of the name, because it is the same Because it was forbidden as the prohibition of the Qur’an, or because it is the fear of the people of faith to it, or because it is a judge, and the courts are the mother of the book, and I do not supply The face of the name is not obligatory, but I delegate the matter to you, and the peace of God is upon you, (it is not said): If the conqueror is a gathering of the suffering of the book, then the book is from it I know the dé Excellency does not look at your images, and it was seven in accordance with the number of the verse that includes many of the secrets, and it was from the shadows of the darkness that was not found The light, and it is collected after the projection of the deceased: (a path on the right to hold it), which is the mauran, which is covered by it with its light family to the sign of the majesty to the greatness of the With it, it is reducing what indicates the mercy in Al -Fateh, but the remaining seven did not fall from this species, so the Nurani will be cleared to know that the matter is not.Except the losers, and in the words of the Almighty: I predict my servants that I am the Forgiving The Most Merciful and that my torment is the eternal torment of a sign and any sign of that to those who contemplate the state of the two sentences, that in the universe of the Nuraniya, it is four twenty -year -olds.(P-37) with its perfection, and the shadow is a seven of it, and if the Sundays are touched, Nurani will be with him a shadow, and a pure and a pure sign of the sake of the sake of the sake, The light of his faith did not like the injustice of his transgression, and a believer has been young, and there is a symbol that there is no contradiction between faith and disobedience, so do not be guided by the injustice of it.A believer) “It is forbidden for the fullness, and the search is not for this, and if the fallen is noticed, which is the shadow of the custodian, referring to the unjust, the forth from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The pure light, referring to the pure believer, and the corrupted light, referring to the distressed believer, the secret of the triangle appears in: from them is the oppression The precedent of goodness is the permission of God, that is the great preference The fall is proven, or the seventh is taken from this, and this is for the pleasure of his knowledge, and his ignorance of his ignorance, peace be upon him, in the cow of the fallen, so that it is a slander, so that it is a slander, so that it is a slander.And the two in the between, for this, this is the hijab, and the clothes were harvested, and this is what we swear to our proverbs from the secrets of the book of God Almighty, and where is what appears to those who are unknown, Those who are misleading from the water of its secrets.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in investigator, the lowest imam, as he made the causes of this virginity, so that it is the sacrifice, so that it is a good It is indicated by the coffee, and the gym is the first letter from Hell, and the fear is felt by the treasury, and the Zay and the shin are from the exhalation and the righteous, and the okay is denied, and it is denied, And the first shadow in his saying is up to the Almighty: they went into a shadow with three peoples and also indicating a shadow, and fulfillment of the separation, then he said: If they said: There is no letter Reminded in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so it does not remain because you are mentioned, so we say: The one is in it is that he said in the description of the hell of Hell: A part of a divided and then the highest seven of the forefathers from this surah, and it is the firsts of the conservative indication of the torment, alerting it to the one who has read it, and the one who reads it, Its truths, it became safe from the seven parties in hell, ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit him and does not enrich him, as he said to say: And the eye, the eye, the m and the guy, as the waw is from the wew The torment, the m, is from the guidance, the richness of the Gawashi, and the verses are back, and everyone is in the people of the fire, and the good is in its overthrow as the one who is unique in the projection May God have mercy on him, other than that, but with the peace of his peace from what was said, or it is said, I do not seek it for pride, and he is the master who has become happy, His family, and as for his attribution (P-38) to the Commander of the Faithful, upon the honors of God, the Exalted and his face when he asked the Romans to be Muwadiah, so he did not ask, so he did not.So, I do not pray for him, and on the ability to surrender, then what is permitted to be satisfied with this fate is only an alert to the questioners on what is not hidden from you, so that it is not hidden from you.It takes care of your guidance.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, the surah of the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, as for its disgrace on the praise, it is an appearance, and so on the thank you, for the one who is the best of God.To be asian as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the four as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth).We seek help, and the following is the twenty -one, the sixteenth and the twelve eighth) is the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths of the righteousness ( Ten) the surah of prayer is because it is a duty or a child in it, and the junction is the gold of some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, and it is said: (I divided the prayer between me and between Abdi Nasfin), and wanted the surah, and the linguistic metaphor for the relationship of the kidneys and parties, or the necessity of the righteousness, as a right Obtained, (and ten) the light for its appearance as a lot The Qur’an, (and the ten and ten) the great Qur’an, which is the back of what we presented, (and the second and ten) are the second seven because it is seven verses with an agreement, and what we have seen.And the saying that it is eight is like saying that it is an abnormal nine that is not packed with, or an illusion from the one, except that from them Whoever promises the name is a sign without you, and among them is the opposite, and the path of the narration, then the second does not dearely that the adultery of the verse does not suit the adultery of the sake of the good The victory is what is from this section, and it is praised and risen in every rak'ah and prayer with a kneeling, or what is noticeable is the most difficult of the prayer, so the one rak'ah is not mentioned in the one or the prayer of the one in the prayer The bodies are disturbed, and the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, not a righteous prayer, and it was said: It was described with that because it is praised by another wall, or because it was a long A supplication and a blessing, or because it is the same as the servant reads from it a verse that God is exalted, with the news of his action as in the Hadith of the famous, and it was said otherwise The second will be from the trinity, and it is enticed to be of praise for the praise of God Almighty, or when he returned from the praise of those who recite it, and that it is the one who is the same, and that you will be We excluded it for this nation and praise to God for this grace, then the wisdom in the mourning of the Qur’an is like the books, the dispute of the Lazski, to be the same And I send the crops like the migrant if he cut off a tendency or a copy of that breath of that, and active for the walk, and if the preservation takes the surah, he will be taken away from him.It is independent, so he grew up with what he has preserved, and also the sexes if it is folded under it, types and kinds of kindness, it was better than that it would be a single door, with it, with that of that The surah with its inception is miraculous and a signs of God Almighty, and the rule in its color is long and short, it appears to be hidden.
