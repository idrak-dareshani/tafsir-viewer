or do not go a lot until it was the first to descend, so the Tabrani was brought out in the oldest by his bond on the condition of the validity of the one who said: Moses Al-Ash'ari reads us, and we will sit with a shower, upon him the garments of Ramadan.On Muhammad, the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Al -Hakam has been brought out in the header and Al -Bayhaqi in the evidence and corrected it from Aisha.And one of the most of one was brought out from Mujahid, who said: The first of what was descended from the Qur’an: Read in the name of your Lord, then n and the pen, and narrated the sheikh on the authority of Abu Salamah ibn Abd al -Rahed.Abdullah: That is, the Qur’an was revealed first?He greeted, “The hadith was brought up in the hadith of what he claimed and answered the first of him with the number of guerrillas that passed its remembrance.It was said: Al -Fateh.And he was carried out by a hadith that was sent by his men, which Al -Bayahqi brought out in the evidence and al -Wahadi from the way of Yunus ibn Bakir from Yunus ibn Umar on the authority of Abi Umar on the authority of Abi Umar on the authority of Abu Shahrbil, and it is answered that what is in it is enticed to be a news of what we have come down after read, and you who are inherited, with the most powerful of him, and it is stronger than him.It is more important that the first of what we descend is read, then "n", then, O, the binding, then O, the developed, then the conqueror.And it was said: The first thing that came down to its chest is not known to the cave of Hara, then the last of it came down after that, with what God Almighty wills, and he is the back of what the Imam and the one who did not come to the Imam Al -Razzaq and others from the way of Ibn Shihab on the authority of Araba ibn al -Zubayr on the authority of Aisha in the hadith of the beginning of the revelation, and in it: Al -Jahid, then send me and said: Read in the name of your Lord who created the human being from a relationship, read and your Lord, the honorable who knows the pen, did not know.The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, has shivered with his bids until she said: Then he did not like and shine to pass away and fled the liking.” At the end of what they narrated, Ibn Shihab said: Abu Salamah told me about Jabir bin Abdullah Al -Ansari, he said while talking about the veil of the lion, and he said: I heard a voice from the sky, so I raised my eyes, so if the king who came to me with the homes sitting on my chair between the sky and the earth, I was brought up from it, and I was brought up, so I did not return Zamlon, Zammlon, and God Almighty revealed: O you who are inherited, and warn, and your Lord, grow up and your clothes, purify and ritual.The weakness of the reciprocate is known to him as the one who is the first one who descended from the Qur’an to release what was narrated from the first of the mortal as the one who is not the one who does not hide from the one who is not.It is upon him, and we mentioned the chest of the words in Surah, who is in which he said in it while he talks about the virginity of the one, and his saying: “So the king came to me.” “The greeting and follow -up,” that is, after his time.And in the sentence: the correctness, as some say, and it is the one who chose it that the chest of this is the generous surah is the first of what the Qur’an descended on the divorce, how is it and it was mentioned.The narrator on the authority of Aisha is one of the most correct of the hadiths, and in it: “The king came to him and said: Read.He said: I said:“ I am not a reader, so I took me, so he covered me until I am.” And it is clear that “what” has a navigator, but the nawye said is the right thing and that is perceived first Al -Bayyan and we will refer to it, if God wills.And in the revelation: the face is the pregnancy of the saying of Jabir on the full surah, and in the explanation of a Muslim correctness: the right thing is that the first of what was descended: read any: divorced, and the first, and the first is the first Al -Waha: O you who are inverted, and the

Qur’an, so the one is estimated with the vertebra of the place, as it was said: and the verb is not a house that is obligatory, nor is the verb of his saying that he said: As (P-179) Abu Ubaidah said and claimed that the meaning: Remember your Lord, but it is the original and its cursing is the same and it is attached to what it is in it or with the same.The meaning is a start or a conquest in the name of your Lord, that is: Say the name of God, then read, and it is an apparent that he was unhappy with the name of his name, and the name of God, and the name of God.Thus, the name is a part of every surah, and it is searching, and so that it is based on it that it is not from the Qur’an for the opposite; For a saying, it says: It devotes the Qur’an that is effective.And some of them He inferred that it was not a Qur’an in the ills of the light that it was not mentioned as it was correct from the news of the beginning of the woven revelation of the Kayfiyyah, as this is the same as

from the way of laughter.Muhammad, seek refuge and then say: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, “And the saying was that it was the first thing that was revealed by one of the

down to release and in which it is a phenomenon as it is not hidden.It was permissible to be the costume for the use of the one who is attached to what it has or with a deleted one immediately and the perseverance was shown in its peace from the illusion of the name of the name of the name What is related to that is the first book, then it is not in the remote matter to be a depression of what is not unbearable, whether the matter is indicated by the Fur or not; Because he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, knew that what was revealed by a Qur’an, then the cost of his readers is upon

the fundamentalists mentioned that this is a bias for the mourning of it in the saying of Jabriel, peace be upon him: Read the masculine in the hadith of the beginning.Al -Amidi said when the male of the evidence of the last of the last of the two people from the time of the speech that is gone to a group of Hanafi and others: and from the evidence that the evidence is that He said to the Prophet,
