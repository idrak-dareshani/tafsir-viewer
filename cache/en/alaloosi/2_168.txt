The Quranic researcher, O people, eat what is in the land that was permissible in the polytheists who have forbidden themselves, the lanted, the night, the connection, and the weld.Abbas - may God be pleased with them - and it was said: In Abdullah bin Salam and his Arabism; Where they forbade themselves to the flesh of the camel, when it was forbidden in the debt of the Jews, and it was said: in the people of a vulnerable, the sons of Amir ibn Sa`sa, and the sons, Where they prohibited the dates and the most powerful on themselves, and (halal) is either an effective (all) or a state of the connector; That is, they are the case of a halal one, or a description of a confirmed source; That is, a halal eaters.And from the two estimates of the two people to the metabolism; Let it be effective for (both) and on the first estimation, it is permissible to be a predecessor attached It will be a pretext, but rather it is appointed as in the revelation on the authority of those who made the origin in the perplexes of pornography, and that it is a whiteness that is based on what the satisfaction of the one who is satisfied.In the original, it is a prestige, except that there is something that is unjust or estimated, it is some of the pilgrims with (from) and the validity of the one is not required to do the time, It is an ovation to this estimation; Because it is in the location of the effective in it, and the verb does not install two effects while it is a building, on what is in the way and otherwise, that the one who is clear) And his mark is the validity of the one who is noticeable, and the matter is for the jujuba if the largest of the sons of the structure and the delegation, as if it is for the sake of the sake That, (and the appropriateness of the verse for what he accepted): that he - they are - when he explained the neutrality and his evidence, and what the repentants and the two families followed that, followed by the remembrance of it.To indicate that the infidels do not affect the piece of gravity, and the words of the Almighty: (good), a row (halal) and its meaning as the imam said that your money does not find it.He hates him, or he sees him as a purpose for the severity of the suspicion, and the righteousness of the ruling is the righteousness of the judgment, as in the words of the Almighty: there is no one in the land of the Lord.Some of the halals were forbidden, for the disintegratedness is a general characteristic that prevented the disagreement other than the Sufis, and the Imam Al -Shafi’i said - may God be pleased with him - The righteous desire for the correct mood, and it is replied by that what is not intended is either permissible, there is no suspicion in it, so it is not forbidden, otherwise it comes out, and it comes out.With the permissibility, the stipulation is stated in his solution, and this is what he did not want in it a text, but it is what is delighted and that the ritual pride is not in the way, and it is not in the righteousness, and it is not in the shadow.As ancient and anchors, and the first look The restriction is to say: The piety is not for the unparalleled of what the corrupt lust deepens, but rather its formation in its concepts; The good and those who are said only to what the straight lust deals with, and the extension of the righteousness is then the eavesdropping on the pornography of what is forbidden in the pornography of what they have forbidden On this interpretation, referring to the prohibition on the most important of the enemies and liabilities; Because that is not developed; Because the food that is eaten, as well as what the lust is evaluated, is that it is not eaten by the righteous lust, and between the two of the meaning, and between the two of the meaning, and between the meaning of the meaning, and between the meaning of the meaning of the meaning Some of the investigators, and some of them inferred from the verse (P-39) that those who prohibited a proverbial food, then it is a luminous, and it is not forbidden for it, and in which there is no hidden, no hidden, or the hidden, and they are not hidden, and they are not hidden, and they do Its effects - as he was told about the immortality - or his work - as it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him - or his sins - as it was transferred from Mujahid - And seek its Sunnah, then prohibit the halal and analyze the forbidden, and from the sincere: Nafaa, Abu Amr and Hamza by silence the Ta'a, and they are two languages ​​in a group (a step), which is between the feet of the livestock, and he read to me - the generosity of God Almighty - Tawjeh and Jahan; The first: What was said: The Hamzah is original from (sin) in the sense of (sin), and the second: Waw has gone a gossip; Because the guaranteed waw is flipping for it, the one (Ajuh), and this when the conscience was made, it was made as if it was on it, the gospel said: And this is a reward for it.Read with two conquests, on the authority of (a step), which is the time of the steps.It is a clear enemy of 168 to finish, and (indicated) from the meaning of that and appeared; That is: the appearance of the enmity with the insight, even if the mandate appears to those who are tempted, and for that he was called a guardian in his words, the Almighty: Owali That is from the door of the sword, and it was said: (Aban) in the sense of the appearance; That is, the appearance of enmity, and the first is the most promoted in the cessation.
