The researcher of the Qur’an knows that it is attached to the authority and the cause of it and the guarantee for any of the sake of that, that the Messenger is satisfied with the Messenger and the charity of the belief of the confirmation of the confirmation of a firm, a confident They have been informed, that is, the one who has been informed of the monitoring, which is before: the sons of Tamim, who killed more, for the one who is informed of the truth is one of them, and it is the same as it is the peace The famous that it is informed of the angels, peace be upon them, to the Prophet, the messages of their Lord, which is the appearance of it, as it is other than that Let it be a start and a sentence that he will tell him his news and a loyalty to form it to be the name of a communication.He said it to the Almighty and surrounded what they have, that is, with what the monitoring and the essence of everything, that is, what was and from what would be a number, that is, an individual, a state of the agent of the age With him, he will come to him for the more of the affairs of his knowledge of all the things and his uniqueness, their grace, with that, on the authority of his face, in which he does not have a face that does not Those who are the rides of knowledge, as if it was said, but the pharmacist is the Messenger, God Almighty knows, with the mediation He surrounded all the conditions of those (P-97) mediators, and the knowledge of all, and all the things in the face of a detailed partial face.He came to him for the sign that the monitoring themselves did not increase and did not shorten what they were rhetoric as if it was said that the Messenger knew that the absence The Almighty has learned all of them and knew everything, and if they had increased or they were excluded at the rhetoric of his knowledge of his followers, then what was the choice of them and what he chose to do so We will give me the self -esteem in the interpretation of these generous verses, and I am on the authority of his command, in order to be the same as the one who says it, so it is not the same The generosity of the guardians of seeing some of the seizures is not to be fulfilled because his saying is the Almighty, so he does not appear on his unseen one in the power of the judgment of a valid one.The general benefit in the way of the negative and the most of its narcotics is for the negative of the general, and he stated that it is here in the explanation of the intentions, not for the perpetrator of the negative, and it is the negative of the reward.Partial, as if some of the absence appear on my guardian, on the part of what he said, some of the Sunnis of the Sunnah said in his saying, the exalted not realized by the sight [Al -Anam: 103].It is not necessary that the discretion is that the Messenger is satisfied with a vast one, with the exalted, based on the fact that the discipline of the negation requires a positive thing And the effect of the penalty righteous, with the whole, is that he did not appear to be one of the one who was on all of what he knows, glory, and for you Because of the obedience of the disciplined, the son of Abbas, and so does not want that God Almighty denied the purification of something from his absence on one of the Messenger, but the Messenger is not.The angels on something of it, because the Messenger is here is a backward in the human Messenger for his saying, “He will see you, etc.That is necessary that no one of the prophets who are not a messenger is not appeared on the will of the special meaning of the Messenger here, and that is why we are not mentioned The pharmacy of the Messenger shows something of the unseen that does not relate to his premature and does not disturb the emergence of it with the provisional judgment, as there is no time It is attached to the abandonment, but it is referred to to the one who is attached to it to fulfill the place for that, and the being of every absence that appears to the Messenger, and it is only a comment to stop.And for those who are interpreters, there are words, not a miserable, with his remembrance of what he has and what he has to do is according to the place, then the matter after that to you, so we will say when it was the same With the honor of the guardian by looking at the absence, and the appearance of his saying, the high school of the unseen, does not appear, etc.It was from the appearance on the absence, because those who are added to them, and if they were the guardians of the two, are not the messengers, and God has summed up the lord of the messenge And the abuse of priesthood and the dignity, because their companions are something of the etiquette and put it in the line.Glory be to and accuse, believe, and see the interpretation of the verse on a face that does not contradict their time He exalted on his absence of a form of a general, and it is sufficient to work with his necessity that the transgression of his creation will not appear on one of his unseen, so we will carry it on the authority What is meant by the verse is that it is not the same as this absence, so there is no significance in the verse that it is a groan that does not show anything After his saying, he said, "If I know, I will come to what you are promised and what is meant by the day of the Day of Resurrection, then he said," If you carry this, then he said: A Messenger with the fact that this absence does not appear for anyone of his messengers, we say, but he will show it at the proximity of the resurrection And the angels are descending [Al -Faraqan: 25] and there is no doubt that the angels know in that time and also it is necessary for this to be the discretion of this.It does not appear on his absence The specialist is the resurrection of the resurrection, and then it was said except for those who are satisfied with a messenger, for he asks those between his hands and from his successor, a memorization of his memorization.And it is followed by the fact that in its absence (P-98), what indicates the generally as you heard first and the righteousness does not refuse to them except that he is stabbed in that.Also, his first answer appeared about the saying, as the one who is intended for the Messenger in the verse of the royal messenger, and he refuses to say what is after his words, so that he is the same The angels, according to the hour, on the day of the sky, the sky is not shown, but it is from the clearing of the absence, and it is the end of the testimony, such as the emergence of the ritual, and what is in the righteousness.Put it to otherwise, and also the deduction on the face, which he mentioned very far, as it is in it in it that is cut off from the precedent and the right to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who said: Likewise, it does not harm in the interruption, and it is said that the appearance of the absence in the sense of seeing it on the authority of my face, where he will be the highest of the knowledge of the knowledge, nor the knowledge.It is harmful in that income that benefits the general in the way of negation, because the base is more frequent, not a chain of transmission because of its saying, and God does not love every feedback [23] And the saying of his grace, and God does not love every sinful disbelief [Al -Baqara: 276].This is a text on that of the flaws, so the meaning is, so it does not appear on anything from its absence, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger, for he is a chapter, for he is a chapter.That he wages, etc., and he does not want the dignity of the guardian, as it is not from the removable purification, as he does not get the highest times of knowledge with the unseen that he tells him, but he is taught to him, Or the like, as well as other than the arms of the infidels, and others, and it is followed by the fact that the Sufis of the one who said like the Sheikh is the religion of the religion of the religion.The guardian and his arrogance, with some of the absences, sometimes and guide him to his descent, to whom he said, the Almighty said that those who said, our Lord, and then they are righteous: And if what he gets for him, then he thinks, or like it, there is no knowledge, such as the knowledge that has the Messenger, by the medium of the king, does not give up on the search, but may be in the authority of the The pioneer is the one that comes to the Messenger, and it is necessary that the king does not appear on the absence, as the messenger of the Messenger of the Messenger of the evil is on what is the apparent and obligatory that it does not appear The predecessor and appears in his midst of what is not in the first place and also that it is necessary that what is obtained for the Prophet is other than the Messenger in the meaning of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same As you see.It was said that the unseen in the two sites is the gender and the emergence of it on what you heard, as well He preserved it and increases the owner of the revelation in the response to the absence of the absence, if it is an interpretation of what he made in the saying of the Almighty who believe in the absence of the absence: [3] Because it is permissible for you to know his flags, or with his indicative installation.This is the second, meaning the mind is denied by the verse and guided until the way of the methods of evidence is also by the mediator of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon them.On the other hand, on the other hand, that the meaning of that meaning is not informed of it except a messenger or take from them, and there is no dignity in it in the first place.Specialization in agreement, so there is nothing in it, and if it is interpreted by the enemy, as he mentioned it in his saying, the high of the unseen and testimony [73] Specialization, and so if he was interpreted by what was absent from worshipers, or by the secret that the appearance of the verse is that he is the highest world of every absence, and he does not appear on the authority In particular, his attributes are glorified and exalted with the addition of the addition, except for a messenger, and he is like that, because his absence is a transcendent, and it is not informed of it except with the flags of a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger, or a messenger or a Repeated to him, but rather, and the least of the few than him, so the concept referred to the fact that this is not this special type than the unseen, and it is not forbidden from the knowledge of God.Without regret.Then if he was peace, then the second is either asking, and if he said his pursuit, he will not be informed of all of him, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger that did not indicate that it is not permissible for the one who is permissible.Either a divorced woman who comes to the fullness of it, so he returns to what we have seen and add to the indications of adding the addition and release, so it is not a face to know it with this and the one who is the same From the verse on the heights of the priesthood and the dignity, it is not up, even if their heroes are truly because they denied it, and it is a preference for the atonement In this verse, as our good sheikh transmitted it from the one (P-99), the glasses, and the one who is lonely, ended.And he discussed in it that the bearer of his absence on the absence of the meaning of what is attached to it is the Almighty and his attributes are glorified and exalted, which does not suit the context, and that it is a matter It requires the ability to connect the discretion and positive against what we have denied to the attribution that the Messenger appears on all his absences, to what appears to appear in the knowledge First of all, it is understood from what was said to be carried by his absence on the general of the seal, that is, the general of the unseen, which is devoted to it, and it is not the same, so it is not the same The Messenger is on the human Messenger and the condemnation is interrupted.His uniform, with whom his knowledge is high, except for those who are satisfied with a messenger, and he will appear on some of his absences until he is his brother, so there is no good.With the verse on the denial of dignity.And the choice was interpreted that he does not know him with the self, but he is a true knowledge that is based on me, as well as the reason for others, but it is his sake, and it is his knowledge of it.There is no knowledge of the unseen except by the reckoning of the back and the proportions of some of the human beings, and it was said that he wanted the unseen, which is not the same as the high Those who are in his flags are exalted, as it is additional to the lineage to those who did not know.And he said second in the answer to the recipient, and perhaps he wanted the answer to the people what he stipulated and his answer is to specialize the Messenger with the king and the emergence of what is the one who is the same The absences will be received from the angels, that is, by puffing in the horror and its grace.He obtained it that the reciprocate is that it is fulfilled if it would be achieved as the being of the Messenger, the Messenger of Hashar and the king, all or the messenger of the human being, and only the Messenger of the No, and everyone is varied, as it is permissible for the Messenger to be specialized in the Messenger of the king and that he is intended to purify the collapsing without a medium, and the meaning is, so it does not appear without a ritual That is to contradict the formation of the guardians of his absence, because it is only by the mediator, and it is an answer by preventing the two of the provides, even if it is sufficient for it to prevent one of them, as it is the same as the imam, and the imam is not.The intentions are followed by the fact that the messengers of humanity may recite otherwise After what was said and the strangeness of what was said in this place was only in his saying, except for those who are satisfied with the congestion.The meaning does not appear on his absence, nor whoever is satisfied with a messenger, and his condition is not hidden, then if he interprets his saying, he is the same And the patients and the memorizers who descend with Jabril, peace be upon him, on our Prophet ﷺ about what was brought out by Ibn al -Mundhir and a group of Ibn Jabir His response from Ibn Abbas said: What God has revealed to his Prophet ﷺ is a verse of the Qur’an except with four of the angels, they will keep it until they are kept until they are kept until they are kept The scientist of the abnormal verse.And with the revelation, it may be more than that in some news that he descended with the wall of the year seventy thousand king and came in the matter An accuracy with my lukewarm risk when there is an example in the stomachs of the books, which is that what is meant from his hands in the verse is the apparent forces and from the successor of the inner powers, and he said that he said: Etc.The angels memorize the districts of the phenomenon and the inner of the demons and disobey it from the whispers of the two sides, and if it was the intention of the one who is not the same When the lighter is removed, then you will be leaned, and you will hear it, so you will throw it to the priesthood, and it will be informed of it before the Messenger of the Messenger, as it is the one who is the one who went to it, as it was the one who is the one who went to the one who is the one who went to the one who is the one who gave it to the one who gave it to the one who gave it to the one who gave it to the one who gave it The arrogance of the words on the remote face is that it is a phrase.The two authorities are specialized, but it is appropriate for what we mentioned, not what they mentioned, and it is not hidden that it is the same as the signal, and the transgression is to be made.To fly the flaws from which the demons come with the hard -working gaps and the accurate behavior, and in that of goodness is what is in it and he went to a lot until he is a guarantor to the one who knows They canceled (P-100) either to monitor or to those who are satisfied and collecting with the meaning of the meaning of whom the individuals are in the two guerrillas before it is a reason for its memories and the meaning is that it is the meaning of it.The one has informed the messages of their Lord with knowledge, followed by the part of the part, which is to know it, the exalted, with the actual, as it is in the saying [Muhammad: 31] The absence in the truth is the rhetoric, jihad, and the inclusion of its knowledge, to be exalted, for the highness of its entirety, with their affairs, and the urge to the arrangement of the reward for them.And warning about the deviation in them and its saying is the Almighty and surrounded etc.In the knowledge of the knowledge of what was mentioned from the monotheism of the monotheism on the face of the remote or kindness as some of the claims of a guarantee that it is not the knowledge He knew that, surrounded, etc., and a conscience to be a guerrilla that knows the Messenger inspired by him and the redeeming of the most designed to the descendants.It was narrated from Ibn Jabir who supported him or the messengers, and he surrounded the etc.They informed in it the distance in which it is in it, and on it this science does not fall into what is in the sea except in the hereafter and it was said that he knows that the messenger has been given the sake of the messenger that he did not know They canceled what they were revealed to them, and they did not be the ones who are lying in the excitement of hearing, and both of the two sayings, as you see, and set a number at the gathering of it.The one who is the one who has the most important thing is the number of everything, except that the father of a life said in his being fixed from the tongue of the Arab It is immediately any of the counters, and it is not harmful to the owner of the public, and that it will be a stake on the source in the sense of census, so you hope for all of that To your peace is good.And the "scholar" was read by the installation of the praise "and the knowledge of" a past action "the absence" with the setting and the son of Abbas and Zaid ibn Ali "to know" to know " And the son of Abi Abla, “To know” by adding the ya and breaking the pain from the media, that is, to know God Almighty whoever wants to know that he has been informed of the rituals of God.The son of Abi Abla, “Oat” and “Issa” read all the construction of the one who is active in the two actual.And raised "all" on the wounds and the actor is God, glory and exalted.
