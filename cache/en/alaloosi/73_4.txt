The Quranic researcher or increased his kindness as it was preceded, and the words in the guerrilla, and the meaning does not differ from the two words in it, and it is seduction of it ï·º between the one who is a luminous The half or more than that is the first that the first is in it, in which it made the criterion of the deficiency and the increase in the comparative half of the resurrection, and it is the first of the one who made it for the sake of the righteousness Equally as a quantity, and some of them are ignorant of the exaltation from the remaining night after the second and the two guerrillas, and he said in the reply from a few, not in the same way The dispensation is predicted by it is the remaining part after the one comparative to the rule, not for the part of the outstanding, and it is not hidden that it is on the way of completion.Likewise, the father of Hayyan was exposed to that exaltation by saying: The guarantee of his half then is either he returns to the virginity of him or on the one who is from the one who is from him) He returns to the vigor from it because it is an unknown from the unknown, as it is a few only half the half of the few, and this is not valid for it, the meaning of it On the one who is excluded from him because he abolished it in it, if the night was said, his half, or a shortage of it, or more than it is a few, and he will be over.And he distanced from the dress, and in which we choose the second and what it claimed from the linguistics, we have observed it to pay it and explain it with some of the sake of the saying: The resurrection and its prejudice, because the lack of one of the two descriptions is obligated to the few and alert it to the deviation of what was occupied with obedience and what is not made of the notification that the bit of the bit of the bit of the bit of the bit of the This is from the Bayan after the preacher of the possibility in the gold and the increase in the passion, and the heavens followed the first slit, too, that it is the saying It is correct because (the night) is known, and some of it is half of the half and what is without it and what is lost and not [Al -Baqarah: 249] Rather, there is no guarantee to replace an unknown from an unknown, as a group came to me, some of whom are pedestrians, and with this dependent on him, what was preceded.It was permissible for his half to be an instead of night, some of all, the discretion from it, and the words of the intention of adherence, the delay, the origin, then the half of the night, then the length of the night From him and on him for the least of the half -understanding half of the group of the triumph from it, as if it was said that you are less than the half of the night that you do not have a third of the legend A little that the quarter of the night will rise or increase that less than the half, and the release of this is between the least of the half and the least of the least, or the least of the less (P-103) With his eyes and his properties to seduction between the half, the third and the quarter, the difference is between This face and what was mentioned is the same as the morning, and in the scouts, what is understood from what was said that the seduction is behind the half, that is, while it is less than the half of He is informed of the description or the third decrease.He said in the revelation, but he made the increase without the half and the shortcoming, according to the third, because they had been tired of the correct fraction, it was the most likely to mention.The few are secondly indicative of the approach of that minority, and what is ended to a correct break, not with a little deficiency in the sense of this place, and the saying is in the side It is less than the half of the half, and it is a costly face, and it is like it.Representatives, not that the minority, the decrease, and the increase are counted, as it is mentioned.It also was permissible as the words of the words of the intention and the delay, as it passed a nose, but with the makers of the two guerrillas for the half, not for the least of it, as long as it is in that Between two things, between him, peace and blessings be upon him, less than half of the night at the end of the day, and between the choice of one of the two things, and they are the one who is the half of the half of the half of the half of the half of the half Less than half of the night at the end, decrease or decrease in the half, or increase it with a release.Increased, or more or old, and it is followed by the fact that it is assigned to the assessment of the extension of the extent, it appears that the exile is from the one after the one who is in the past The delay of the discretion is an essence of the original.Because the appearance of this is the return of the two guerrillas to the half after the discretion, because it is the precedent, not the divorced half, and the advertisement is that it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Nafal and the acquisition of the custody of the determination, then in it that it is not permissible to do the half and the fixed readings are returned in the seventh: that your Lord knows that you know that you are The night, his half, and the third of it [Al -Muzammal: 20] with the cycle, then he is inferred from the parallel of the minor on its pity for the consequences of the attachment, it is necessary to inform the exposure The half of that is also, and it is not hidden that some of this rejects the path passionately, and its saying was subjected Before, if you do ten, then it is for you [the story: 27], then the release is not on his right and in it.It was also a summary of the second in the sense of the half of the half, which is the quarter, and it is the one who has a few, and he made the increase on this.As if he was said to be half the night or a shortage of half.[Translation failed: Request exception
