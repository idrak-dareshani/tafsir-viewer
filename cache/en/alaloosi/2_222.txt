The Qur’anic researcher will ask you about the menstruation, the imam, Ahmad, Muslim, and Abu Dawood, Al -Tirmidhi, Al -Nasa’i, and Ibn Majah, and others, are from Anas - may God be pleased with them.(P -121) The woman was laid out of them, they broke her up from the house, and they did not eat it, and they did not drink it, and they did not collect it in the house, so the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - was asked?So God revealed this verse, and he said - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -: They gathered them in the structures, and make everything except for the marriage.Bin Al -Dahdah - may God be pleased with him - and the sentence is given to what it is presented from the same, and its appropriateness is for him that what was forbidden to be forbidden The people of faith showed a great judgment of the rulings of marriage, and it is the ruling of marriage in menstruation, and perhaps the story of this three questions with the conversion to the one who is in the past The question about the wine and the facilitator, as it was said: They are gathered among you the question about them and the question is about such and such; Each one is a starting question, and the collection was not intended between them, but the news is about each one at the same time, for this is not the wow was repeated between it, and the owner of Al -Anth And the leaving: The first of the conversations is appointed to the first from the crowd, but his answer was first with the behavior because he is the most important, and if he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not Then, when the first answer was not in the first answer, the question was given to the question, so that the question was returned to the question, and it is a virtuous pardon, so he will be forgiven.By the first, and the second question of the chair is a lot about the conditions of the orphans, and is it permissible for their mixes in the taling They woke up to them, and if he was kind to the question of spending, and the third question, when he was a disgrace to the restriction of the menstruation, the people of his kindness on what he did not have for what they were.They do it from the retirement of the orphans, and if the inventor's questions are considered to be the one who did not find a condemnation or a suitable suit.The month of the forbidden and the third of the wine and the facilitator, and between it from the second and the prohibitions that are not hidden, so it was mentioned, as well With the creations of the Bayan, which you find only in the dear book.Many-: The woman is the woman who is menstruating menstruation and a naughty, so it is like the coming and the evidence, And the origin of the nights, it is said: the night is menstruating and overflowing, Al -Azhari said: And from it it was said: for the existing is a tank; Because water is menstruating; Any liquefy, and the Arabs enter the waw at the ya; Because they are from one sex, and it was said: It is a place here, and we are attributed to Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them -.The one narrated from Ibn al -Sakit: that if the verb is one of the three of the three, it is like a prolonged, and he is menstruating, then the place of the place is broken, and the source is from it It is not the choice in its example, but it was said: The fracture and the conquest are coming in the name of time, place, and exporting, and on what was attributed to the transgression, and the choice of the imam, and the choice His Exalted said: Say it is a harm, that is: a place of harm, and so he needs the adoption of time in his saying of his grace: So they disgrace the women in the menstruation of the righteousness of us.The position of menstruation, and if the imam chooses it, and said: The meaning is: they disappear the positions of the menstruation, and the harm is a source of its harm, then it will harm it and then, and it is not said in al -Mashaur: For the sake, the intended meaning of it is resurrected, and it is pleased with it, and it is used in it with the way of the kinna, and the intended of the delay of the women is the same It is understood by the last of the verse, but the verb is given to the self for the exaggeration, as in the words of the Almighty: your mothers are forbidden to you and the apparent places of the apparent Creativity in its affairs; Where others are not deluded in the first place, and it may be said: there is no place, and the hadith of the return is mostly, but it is considered what we have seen to adopt it in what we have known (P-122) to the number of people, The power of the person who is to be able to estimate and its numbers are first, but it was described as a harm and arranged the judgment on him with fulfillment and was not satisfied with the answer to the matter of the arrival, Fall in the breath.And do not bring them until they purify a report of the previous ruling; Because the matter is still the matter that is forbidden by the kinship and the opposite, so each of them is decided, even if you are in the way of the concept, so there is no one who is over.Bayan for his goal, because the supply of the retreat is by saying that his praise and exalted: And it is understood from it, and it is not clear after it, and it is not clear to him as a slightness with disagreement until they purify them and the abuse of blood is when the imam is Abu Hanif.If the deduction is more than the period of menstruation, the proximity is to be in the abstraction, and if it is less than it, it is not permissible except with the abandonment or what is in the ruling of it.Al -Shafi’i is the expansion after the stomach, they said: It is clear to him the readers of Hamza and Al -Kisa’i and Asim in the narration of Ibn Ayyash: (Clearly), and what is meant With it, they are grabbed, not because the abandonment is a true meaning of purification, as it is delusional for some of their phrases; Because he recovered it as a great way to the glorious words and the hadiths on what is not hidden from the follower, but because the form of the exaggeration is avoided from the fullness of the fullness, and the fullness of the fullness, and the fullness of the fullness, For women from the menstrualism is the abandonment, and when the readiness of the tightening indicated that the end of the prohibition of kinship is the abandonment, and the origin in the readings of the arrests, the lords of the rituals On it, it may be claimed that the purification indicates the abandonment, as well as according to the language.His Excellency said: If you purify them, then they will indicate a commitment to the end of the end.Because it requires the delay in the permissibility of the two people from washing, it strengthens the fact that the one who wants to be lightened is the washing of the washing, not the feud, and perhaps it will be in the way The purification of his load on the loyalty if he did not accept what was presented, and on the satisfaction of this and this and that of this, and the return to the saying that the reader of the ritual is from the ritual The bloodshed of blood is neither unnoticed nor permissible, nor consort, and the readings of tension from purification, and the abandonment is beneficial, it is also said in the face of gathering as in the revelation: the reader: Because of the full end, and by lowering the deficiency, and even in the verbs, a counterpart in that it does not require the entry of what is after it, so the whole is the fullness, and the fullness, and the fullness What is an absence of all its parts, which is the outside of the temptation, and the deficiency is what is absent with the arrogance And the inner of the verbs is like that it does not require whether it is a part of what it accepted, so the blood of blood is absent from the prohibition with the last of its last In it, and the absence of it is for it with his first admission, so do not oppose between the two readings, and perhaps the extension of the two end of the two, with the sake of the prohibition of the kinship, and the rituals of the kinship, From his aftermath, and when our Hanafi's masters saw that we are the two readings of fear and tension, and that the first leading of the end of the deprivation is the same as the time of the solution The exhibiting deprivation ended with the harm, and that the second performer is a long time for it, but rather after the abandonment, and they saw that the purification is not to the one who is not.The abandonment is a language, but it is in it in the deduction of blood, which is the narrator of Ibn Abbas and Mujahid, and in the crown of Al -Bayhaqi: it was purified, the disagreement of the tumor, and in Shams al -Alam: Other than (E), her blood was cut off, and basically: a pure woman and women whispers are purified from menstruation, and that is not opposed to that in the dictionary for a pharaoh to be Payan for the recovery - even if it is metaphor - on what is its way in many of the provinces, and that the bearing on the abandonment is a metaphor from other times, which is not valid for what is not correct, and it is not correct They purified and they came to them as two centuries - based on what they mentioned - there is nothing, and what they mentioned in the face of (P -123) the significance of the need in it.Because the fulfillment of the interior of the sentence that does not reconcile to be a condition like the construction sentence of the abandonment of the bond, as it is stated in the son of the son By saying the Almighty: Say: If you love God, then follow me, and if peace be upon you, then the abode will delay the permissibility of the two people from the washing in the sentence, and there is no divorce.What is meant by the rule of lowering is also the washing, and that the saying that one of the two ends is inside the judgment, and the other is outside the disagreement of the one who needed to make it to all of them.It is independent, so hold the first on the severity of the period, and the second is to complete the habit that is not the greatest period of menstruation, as it was carried out.And running in (your legs) in the state of lightness and its numbers, which is the appropriateness; Because in the end of its proximity in the deduction of the most of the washing, its removal is a ruling, and it is contradictory to the ruling of the law for the prayer of the prayer for the prayer of the prayer.It is a clearance of the ruling on the disagreement of the completeness of the number, because the law did not cut it on the purification, but it is permissible to do so, and then, if it did not increase, and it was not the same, it was not the same, and it was not the same.In agreement, it is necessary that the requirement of the second is the prohibition of the sanctity before the washing, so the deprivation was raised before it, with the first time of the prayer - the one who is the one who is the time Judgment on what they said opposed the text in the meaning, and the answer is that the second reader was specialized from the image of the deduction of the twentieth with the readings of the lower The investigators, and what is hidden in the imam's gold is not hidden from the teaser and the stomach is not hidden, and it is narrated from Al -Awza’i: that the solution of the two is stalked on the purification, The menstruation, and it may be said to purify the laboratory, and it was brought out by Bukhari, Muslim, and the women from Aisha - may God be pleased with it -: God Almighty, peace be upon him - on his wash from the menstruation, and he commanded her before she was lost.He said: You purify it with it, she said: How?He said: Glory be to God!She purifies with her, so she lied to her, so I said: You follow the effect of blood.The imam is gone - and it is not hidden that nothing of that is complete purity for the women, but rather it is complete purity For their members, and it is the disagreement of the one who is the one who is in the verse, but the one who is the first is the first, and what is in the hadith, and if it is an order to purify the woman, but what is meant by the one in the way The position, except that it is for something that he did not declare - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and the launch of the purification of the purification of the place, but we do not deny it (Purification) on the one who purifies the positions of their menstruation and without proof, the men of the men, and he is inferred by the verse that he does not prohibit the resignation of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the rest He is forbidden by slow, and Aisha was asked - may God be pleased with her - while Ibn Jarir brought him out: What is permissible for the man from his wife if she is a menstruating woman?She said: Everything is nothing but gathering.A group went to the sanctity of the enjoyment between the secret and the knees, as it was brought up by your money from Zayd ibn Islam: And he greeted - and he said: What is it permissible for me from my wife while she is a menstruating woman?And he said to him - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - to be tightened by her wraps, then you will be with you.As if it is from the door of the batch of the arms in the sentence, and this is what he returned as the Imam brought it out of Ahmad: and the relief from that is better, and the matter is in the verse to porn it.The two people, but it is restricted by his saying, Glory be to Him: From where God commands you, that is: from the place that God has commanded you - the Almighty - by avoiding it, and it is not the same Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatdah and Al -Raba’i, and Al -Zajaj said: It is from the flaws in which it is permissible to bring the woman closer, and do not bring them closer to where it is not permissible, as if it is not permissible, if it is not permissible, if it is not.Or a custody, and he was supported that if he wanted the vulva, it would have been (P-124) in (he appeared in it) from; Because the two people in the sense of the consensus are often transgressing with it, and perhaps it is in the matter of prevention when the first people of the saying.God loves the twins from what is perceived of them from the commitment of some sins, such as coming in the menstrual menstruation of leprosy in the child, as he returned in the news, Imam Ahmad, Al -Tramidhi and Al -Nasa’i were delayed from Abu Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - from the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - he said: “He said:“ It was revealed to Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.A man to the Prophet - may God bless him and grant him peace The name "and the value of the woman at that time is a dinar, and this is if the two are at the beginning of the menstruation The blood is red, but if it is at the end of it, the blood is yellow, then he will be given to the half of a dinar, as the effects indicated.And the purified people love 222, meaning: the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is offended by the rulers of God The rhetoric is required, and it is metaphorically in the first place and the sun of the sciences, and on the authority of a gift: he carried it on purification with water, and the two sentences are an elaboration of what is done.
