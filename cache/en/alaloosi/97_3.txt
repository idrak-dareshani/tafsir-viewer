The researcher of the Quranic, his charity: The night of the destiny is better than a thousand months.If this is Arabized by the promise of its kinship, and on the authority of Safyan ibn Ayena that everything in the Qur’an is from the saying of the Almighty: (I do not realize) He greeted him, and what he says is his saying: (And what he realizes) did not know him, glory and exalted with him.The Bayan was passed by the expression of the two sentences and in the purification of the night of destiny in the two times from the affirmation of the greatest and the fool of what is not hidden, and it is intended to be removed from it One of the urbanized waves to the worldly sky, it was authenticated by Ibn Abbas that he said: The Qur’an descended on the night of destiny, and it was one to the heavens.The stars.God Almighty revealed it to his Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Twenty years, and in another narration from it, too: the Qur’an was revealed by one sentence until it was placed in the house of the pride in the sky, and it was revealed to him, and he came down to him.May God bless him and grant him peace with the words of the words of worshipers and their work.In the other hand, it was revealed in Ramadan, the night of destiny, and then it was revealed to the arms of the stars as messengers in the Shahur and the days.And the descent after two years is a saying of them, and some of them - which is the most famous - said in three and twelve.And another said: In five and ten years, and this is for the difference in the period of his residence, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.Al -Sha’abi said: What is meant is that we started to remove it in it.And what is famous is that the first of the verses came down: read and that it was the day of the day.Yes, in the sea, it was narrated that the king was descending in Harra was in the twenty -old from Ramadan, so if it is true and the intention was a night, then that, but he showed the words of the people, It is said: He wanted to do his landing to the worldly sky in it, and it is not necessary for it to be determined, and the convergence of his landing is upon him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.It was permissible for the chain of transmission; Because it has been supported in it for the part of the part, the metaphor of the parting or the guarantee.It was said: It is intended to be removed from the wave to the worldly sky separated in my life as destiny that what is meant is (the night of the night).It was said: The Qur’an was revealed to the worldly sky in two ten nights of destiny, three, twelve or five, and he was descending in every night of the night.Each Sunnah, then it is descended by its chances of all the Sunnah.This saying was mentioned by the Imam as an involvement and the conversion of the Qaribi As Ibn Katheer said about a fighter, but it is not dependent on him, and the validity is based on him as he said (p-190) Ibn Hajar in the evil of the Bukhari Loop, which is embedded to the house of pride in the worldly sky, but rather tells themselves.Yes, the saying does not go away by the fact that the travel is there, we will make it for Gabriel, peace be upon him, in the remote Layla.Mr.Jesus Al -Safwi answered that he is a warning in that, based on permissibility like: And others mentioned it in his message, which he wrote in the answer to the question of the deaf warning, or it is said: the guerrilla return to the Qur’an by adopting the sentence of the one who is the one So he is told about the sentence "that" we descended, even if it was from his sentence: (We descended), which is exhausted in his sentence, without his opposite.And they mentioned that the part is where it is an independent, who has a resource for him from where he is in the face of all, and in the mastery of Abu Shama: If you say: We descended from it, if there is no one who does not He descended a sentence, as it came down to a sentence, and if it is from the sentence, what is the face of this phrase?I said: It has a goodness; One of them is that the meaning is: (We) governed his removal at the night of destiny and we spent it with it "and we appreciated it" in the eternal, and the second is that he kept our past and we are with us.That is, it is revealed by a sentence on the night of destiny.I finish.And he did not appear to me in no faces, may God have mercy on him, a good deed, so he will be given in that look, so that you may see.It was said: The meaning: We descended in the best of the night of destiny or in its affairs and its right, for the words of the value of added or the custodian are metaphorical as it is in the words of the one who says: I was afraid that he would descend in a Qur’an, and the saying of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, will come to her: because I have been hacking in myself that he will descend in a Qur’an.And he made some of them in that for the captain and the guarantee, it was said to the Qur’an in the meaning of all of all and part.It was said: In the sense of the surah and does not refuse it to be it, we have revealed it in it when it passed a nose, so there is no need until it is said: What is meant by it is what we have sent down in the night of the fate: The group for its consequences on that and whatever it is to carry the verse on this meaning is not based The world of the unseen to the world of testimony or its proof of the travel there is or is that of that, which does not constitute its lineage to the Qur’an.And they differed in that night, and it was said that it is a news in that, and it was as the Kurman said.Because the last of the news reverses it and what is meant by raising its appointment in it.On the authority of Akrama, it is the night of the half of the people, and it is an abnormal saying that is strange as it is in the antagonism.And what appears Here with the appearance of his words, the Almighty: the month of Ramadan in which the Qur’an was revealed.And on the authority of Ibn Masoud that she moves in the year of the Sunnah, so she will be every year in a night, and the nawye attributed it to Abu Hanifa and his companions, and the most of them.Ibn Razin reported that it was the first night of him.On the basis of Al -Basri Al -Saba, it was ten because it was in her morning in her morning.It was narrated from Zayd ibn Arq and Ibn Masoud as well.On the first ninety -ninths.He was told by Ibn Masoud as well, and on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ishaq Al -Hadiyah and her twenty; Because in the two health and others, they are from the hadith of Abu Saeed Al -Khadri that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “I have seen this night - meaning the night of me I prostrate from her morning in water and mud.Abu Saeed said: The sky rained from that night, and the mosque was stopped, and my eyes were insightful.Twenty.And in a Muslim from the morning of three and twelve, and from what was accepted by the money of Al -Shafi’i, the mercy is that it is the hard night or the third.Ahmad and Muslim, and others, were brought out, “On the authority of Abdullah ibn Anis, that he was asked about the night of destiny, and he said: I heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace "The night is the night" and that night is the night of three and twelve.Ahmad and Abu Dawood and Ibn Jarir were brought out, and others were on the authority of Bilal.He said: “The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: And in the mastery and otherwise it is the night in which the Qur’an was revealed.And the son of Abu Shaiba was brought out on the authority of Abu Dharr that he was asked about the night of the destiny, and he said: Omar, Hudhafah, and people of the companions of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace Seven and ten.Ibn Nasr and Ibn Jarir were brought out in his distress from Muawiyah.He said: “The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: Ramadan.And in the narration of Ahmad on the authority of Abu Harra, he was the last of the night.It was said: It is in the middle of the twenty to move in it, it was said: In his futtar and it was said in his rush.Ahmad, Al -Bukhari, Muslim, and Al -Tarmah, were broken from Aisha, who said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: The month of Ramadan.In a hadith that Ahmad and a group was brought out on the authority of Ubadah ibn Al -Samit, he was exhausted and two hadiths that were brought out by Ibn Jarir and others from Jabir bin Sama What indicates what is also mentioned, but the authentic news indicated that there is a lot, and in the sentences in which it is very different, except that The largest is that it is in the twentieth of the most correct hadiths in that, and most of them are in its stars; That is also and many of them went to the way that is the next night of that fetish.It was correct from the narration of Imam Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawid, Al -Tirmidhi, Al -Nasa’i, and Ibn Hibban, and others, and others.It is excluded that it is a night of seventh and ten, so he said to him: What do you say that, O Abu Al -Mudhar It becomes from that day, the sun is looked at.Some of the news about Ibn Abbas appeared in that, and in some of the people who are delegated to him with what indicates the majesty of the seventh of which they said that it is a full number The two lands are seven, the seventy days, the seventh of the seventh, the seventh of the house, and the prostration on seven, so that it is not what he mentioned to what he knew from the ritual The time of weakening of the body, in which the work of the work increases, and the power of the power of the seizure of the manifestations of the more description, and that it is in the futtar, I hope for the hadiths, and it is also with the hadeeth, and it is also with the hadeeth that it is also with the hadeeth.The time.And Ibn Hajar Al -Haytami said: A group was chosen that it is not obligatory for a night with her eyes from the ten days, but she moves in his loyalty, or a year, or a day, or a year, Or the people will be two, four, or otherwise.They said: The hadiths that are opposed to them are not gathered in it except with that.And the words of Al -Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, in the collection between the hadiths, is required.I finish.It is not hidden that the collection is among that between the hadiths that are opposed in it, as it is not desperate, but the gathering is enacted by that between the hadiths in the way of the one who is in the way of the one who is in it The gathering is released that it is transmitted and what is correct from the two people in the sentence or on the verdict is submitted on the night of the night in the month of Ramadan, with the sake He was upon him and delivered that it was in the first month of Ramadan, and a night was like this.Prayer and peace be upon him: "It is a night like this." That is, in this month, Ramadan, and peace and blessings be upon him, that it is in the month of Ramadan after a night like that, other than that night, which is mentioned.And he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “It is a night like this.” And may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the last of the last ten days, said: “It is in the last ten.” That is, from this special month, and so, as it is seen.And according to the saying of her resignation, some of them claimed that if the first month was a night, then this is the four and ten nights, and if it is a night, then it is the night.And we mentioned it with its system in the anxious style, and there is no Hajj in this way.And in some news, it is mentioned.In the hadith of Imam Ahmad and Al -Bayaki, and others on the authority of Ubadah ibn Al -Samit from its emirates that it is a night with a clear and hidden way, not a hot or cold, as if there is no way in it Even the morning.And the one from him, Ibn Jarir, was brought out in his homage Specials like the one who is appointed to the integrity of its frameworks or its deficiency as it appears.And the judgment in its hidden is that those who ask for it in worship will strive for the worship, so that it can be counted as if the month of the month of Ramadan will revive, as it was in the authority It is likely from speaking with the same, and for my life, it has been in it in a clear easy and in which it comes to what is about to be informed of his ignorance, and the meaning of the sake of God It was called for what was narrated from Ibn Abbas and others that it is appreciated (P-192) in it and spending what is in that Sunnah of rain, livelihood, life, life, and life, to the year The manifestation of its estimation is the Almighty to the angels, peace be upon them.And the land, but some of the deadlines said: The time of the estimation in this night is formed by a lot of saying that it is the night of the half of the people of the people, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a people who is And the blessing in which God said: In it, every wise matter separates and answered that there are three things that are three things: the first is the same as the fate of the affairs, that is, the people of their people, and the people of it The eternal, and the second, the purification of those biopsy of the angels, peace be upon them, that it is written in the fragmented utensils; And that is on the night of the half of the people, and the third is the proof of those mines in copying and its delivery to its rabbit from the municipalities, so the transcription of the abundance of the ritual and the rituals is paid to the rituals, the rituals, the rituals, the dug, the dug, and the rituals, the domination of the ritual Peace be upon him, the copying of the warfare, the winds, the guns, the sequel, and the thunderbolts, and the luxury to Gabriel, peace be upon him, and the copying of the work to the sacrifice of peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.The death and that at the night of destiny.It was said: It is appreciated at the night of the half of the deadlines and the livelihood, and in the night of the destiny in which the good, the blessing and the peace.It was said: This is appreciated by what is attached to the pride of religion and what is in the great benefit of the Muslims, and on the night of the half, the names of those who die, and the one who dies, is written to the mother Knowing the case of the case.Al -Zuhri said: The meaning is the night of the bone and the honor from their saying: a man has destiny with so -and -so, any house and honor.And I was called that, because whoever comes with the act of obedience in it has become It is destiny and honorable with God, glory and exalted, or because obedience has it.It was said: Because he descended in it as a book of destiny by the king of an king of destiny on the Messenger of God with destiny for a nation with destiny.It was said: Because it is descending in it, with an angel of destiny.Al -Khalil ibn Ahmad said: The meaning is the night of the narrow one from the extent of which he was suspended, and it was called that because the earth is narrowed in it with the angels of the angels, and the angels of them A month of administering worship with the largest in the sense that worship is better than worship in a thousand months, and he does not know the abundance From him, he is glorified, and he has been greeted, and he will be specialized in what he wants, and the Lord of a little deed is better than a lot of work.This is not incompatible that everything was more and a fissure was better; To tell a Muslim, “He, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said to Aisha, may God be pleased with her:“ I have a reward for your staple.” Because it is the most difficult of what he said otherwise, and there is no doubt that the little deed may prefer the many to adopt time, and to adopt the place, and the advertisement of how is the performance of the performance.With a group, it is amending five and ten times a prayer, like it, which was given to the individuals to others.Yes, this is the preference that may be reasonable in some and not; As we are in it, and there is no stone for God, glory and glory, and he does not know what he has, except for him, he is the same as his affair.The thousand is specialized by the remembrance, it was said to either to multiply, as in the words of the Almighty: one of them is if it is if a thousand years will be built and many are intended to do so.And in the sea, it is a story that the meaning has a good from all of it, or when Ibn al -Mundhir and the son of Abu Hatim and al -Bayahqi have come out in his Sunnah, from the authority of the Prophet.And he mentioned a man from the children of Israel, wearing the wearing in the way of God, the highest of a thousand months, so the Muslims liked that of that, and they were limited to them, and they were limited to them Surah.Ibn Abi Hatim was brought out on the authority of Ali ibn Urwah, who said: “The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, mentioned four of the children They disobeyed him as a eyes, so I mentioned Ayoub Zakaria and Hazakil Bin Al -Ajouz, and Bin Nuna is shining, so the companions of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace.Jabriel came to him, peace be upon him, and he said: O Muhammad, your nation was surprised by the worship of these eight years, so that God has come to you.We descended, etc.It was said: The man, while he went to what a worshipe A night, if they lived it, they were more right (P-193) that they were called worshipers from those worshipers.Abu Bakr al -Warraq said: The king of each of Solomon and the two centuries were five months of the month, so God made the Almighty to work in this night, and for whom it is a good thing Because if I want the first two centuries, he is saying to him, he has a lot of possessions than that with many, and if I want the second one, I mean, then he is a fare.It was said: May God’s prayers and peace be upon him be upon him, so the nations of the nations are all, so he shortened the customs of his nation, so he was afraid of peace and blessings be upon him, that they would not be informed of the work The age, so God gave him the night of the night of destiny and made it a good one of a thousand months of the nations of the nations, and the Imam mentioned it as a money in the foot, and I have heard of what the reference to me Umayyad, and on what Al -Qasim said that the son of Al -Fadl said a thousand months that does not increase a day and does not decrease a day on what was said by two years, which is a thousand years of approximately; Because it is three and four -year -old and four months, and it is not concerned with that in the island of Andalusia after; Because it is a king who walks in some of the frameworks of the earth and the last of the Arabs of the Arabs, and therefore no one of them has no longer there.And they said by lending them with the tranquility of Marwan.And the judge, Abd al -Jabar, was stabbed in the verse of the verse as a reference to what was mentioned that the days of the children of the illiterate were a slave; That is, by composing the majority, then it is not possible to say that at night, it is a good one of a thousand people of slaughtering: ؎ Do you not see that the sword is the one who decreases, if it is the one who is the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of a The stick and it was answered that those days were great, according to the minimum happiness, so it is not far to say God Almighty: I give you a night The worldly happiness does not remain in the case, and it is different that that night follows its day or not.And the people said: The day of its day is like it, and it was said: Perhaps the face in it is that the remembrance of the Ley is followed by the days and from it if it is a result of it, it is not necessary for it to be.And many do not, but it was said: the guidance is enacted on its day as it is in it.Therefore, it came in its description that the sun is upset, and it has a beam, as it is presented, that is, the greatness of the angels of the angels, and those who are in it, in which there is no The knowledge of its day, and there is no extension in it, if it is not enhanced by it.It is permissible that it is permissible for the good to be known as itself to strive in it in terms of metabolism based on the fact that it does not move, and the appearance of the verse is that it is more than the one who is better Confinity, and the most of the imams are better than it for the verse, and because God Almighty has revealed the Qur’an in which he is and he did not descend on it, and because he is the same Ask it.Ibn Abbas narrated that he said in his saying, Taa’al: And seek what God has written for you for the night of destiny, and because he is glorified and made, he made it for the night of the separation and the righteousness of the separation and the righteousness.Every wise matter and named it and the night of destiny; That is, the estimation, and when it was narrated from Kaab that he said: God is the Heavy hours, so he chose the hours of prayer, and the choice of the days, so he chose the day of the gathering, and he was chosen.He chose the loyalty, and he chose the night of destiny; He is the best of a night in the best month, and because God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, urged work in it; It was authentic: “Whoever rises to the night of the destiny in faith and affiliation with his forgiveness of his sins.” And in the narration: “And what was delayed”.And peace and blessings be upon him, to summarize the night of the gathering with a ritual and day with fasting, and because it was his pneumators and the exaltation of its fear and did not help it as it was hidden from the prestige of it He has gone ahead of the prayers, and it is the simple prayer, and it is not.The most of the span, like my father, gave the good and Abdullah bin Bin Batta and Abu Hafs Al -Brameki, and others, until the night of the gathering is more than the one who is more Ibn Abbas said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “God will forgive the night of the Friday of the people of Islam Other than it.And the like of what was narrated from Ibn Masoud said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: For those who do not share anything with God.Because Ibn Bashkal narrated in his book: (P-194) Al-Qarbah to the Lord of the Worlds with his bond to Omar, may God be pleased with him I have in the night of the night and the day.The night of the plural, and the day of the Friday.And the abomination of the thing is his choice, and because many of them have narrated that the imam is Ahmad, that the day is the master of the days, the greatest and the greatest of God.Ibn Hibban corrected the news: “The sun does not come up and does not exist on the best of the day of the Friday.” It is for that, the master of the Ley, her greatest, and the best of her, and because she is a witness, a witness, whose special and general testimony is witnessed by male, female, young, old, with visionary, and a garden, And the dead, and the night of destiny is not appointed, so only a few are not intended.He answered those of the verse that when he wanted it to be better than a thousand months in which there is no night of destiny as he said, Qatada, and others, so he would not be a good thing.The night of a plural, and the two things are indicated that the most preceding descent is indicating that What is meant by the famous is the most famous of those who give us, and there is no night in it, no night, and the night of a collection, and on the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who is a ritual, and it is not the same No one denounced it, and the first they answered their benefits from what they answered and for the inconsistency, Ahmad ibn al -Husayn ibn Yaqoub ibn Qasim al -Muqarim said: The two sayings in the question are great among the companions and for all the evidences that indicate his correctness, so no one will be given to anyone to make mistakes to say to each Contemporary in the evidence of the two parties and the righteousness of its ways, it is appointed to you, the best of the night of destiny and the insignificance of the night of the gathering, and here is the saying The judge told Abu Ali that Abu al -Hosan al -Tamimi is from the Hanabila, as well as he said: The night of the destiny in which the Qur’an was revealed is better than the night of the gathering of what the gathering is from the night He who did not get the same, as for her for the sake of fate, the night of the gathering is better than it, and it was said: His counterpart is on the night of the naked with the night of the gathering.Then, the appearance of the words of some of the Hanafis, such as the owner of the jewelry, is that the night of the sacrifice is better than the night of the destiny and the path of the Sunnah of the Sunnah, and he will return to it.Sowing what was preceded.And the jurisprudence of it was transmitted to the passion for some of the Shafi’i, that the best of the night is the night of his birth, peace and blessings be upon him.And the naked, then the night of a custom, then the night of the Friday, then the night of the half of the peoples, then the night of the Eid, and I do not see that he has what is dependent on it in that.And God Almighty knows.And what is referred to to it is from the characteristics of this nation, which is required by the most of the news that is mentioned in the reason for the descent, and he stated that it is.Al -Quslani said: It is exposed to the hadith of Abu Dhir at the women, when he said in it: “O Messenger of God, be with the prophets, then if they died?” Then it was mentioned that the mayors of those who say that the news that we presented in the cause of the descent from his vision, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him And he pursues it with his saying: This is an innervolence of the interpretation, so the wound is not paid in the hadith of my father, as the two of the two said, as the son of a lot in the same way I finish.And the first right and wiseness to the preference of prevention.Al -Dakmi was narrated from Anas from the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, who said: “God Almighty has endowed my nation for the night of the destiny, and it was not given.” Take care and do not be afraid.
