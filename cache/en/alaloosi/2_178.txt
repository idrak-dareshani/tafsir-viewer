The Quranic researcher, O people who believe in the parties of some legitimate rulings on the face of avoidance of the excess of those who have been overwhelmed, with what is presented from the signs of the religion, And the re -written, that is, it was imposed and obligatory at the demand of the owner of the right, so there is no harm in the power of the guardian on the pardon The rulers or the killers, the origin of the writing, then it was written by the obligation (P-49) and the word (on) is openly in that.The penalty in the killing, that is, by their reason for a limit.It is mean that it is done with a person like what he did, and it is called the cut in a shortage of the equivalent of his two sides, and the story is a story; Because the story equals the storyteller, and the stories are stories; Because he recalls the same as the news of people, and the killing is a collection of murder as a hurry and a wound, and read: (written) on the construction of the risk, and (Al -Qadas) with the same The one who is reported before his remembrance is a masculine.The free and the servant of the servant and the female in the female is a clear sentence for what is before it; That is, the freedom is made by the free, and it was said: it is taken from it, it was narrated that it was in the ignorance between two lives from the life of the Arabs, and one of them was a long time Let us kill the freedom from them with the servant and the remembrance of the female, so when Islam came, they were tried to the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him It is also indicated that the servant is not killed by the free and the female.Because the concept of the violation is considered if it is not known that it is not aware of the consequences of the attachment, and it was known from the killing of the servant with the servant, and the slave of the slave, and the slave of the servant, who kills the soul The servant with free and female by remembrance of the first way as well as it does not indicate that the freedom is not killed by the servant and the male of the female; Because the concept of violation, as it is a violation of that condition, is a violation that it is not for the most recent discipline, and the hadith is between the good and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Between free, free, servant, and servant, so he prevented Al -Shafi’i and the king of killing the freedom with the servant, whether his servant or a servant other than him was not for the sake of God, but not for the sake of the As for the first, the son of Abu Shaiba was broken on the authority of Ali - may God be pleased with him -: And he did not provide him with him, "and he also came out that he - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said: It was narrated that Abu Bakr and Umar - may God be pleased with them - were not killing the free servant between the appearance of the companions, and no One of them is denied by them, and they are those who did not take them in God - the Almighty - for a blameful mother, and the third is because there is no punishment in the perpetrators between the one who is the one who is in the context of The killing of him, and when our great imam - may God be pleased with him - is killed by the free servant; For his saying - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -: “The Muslims are rewarded with their blood.” In them, and the differentiation in the same is not considered a manifestation that the group had killed one of them, and they were killed by it, and his saying is the Almighty: that the soul is the same We have a sign of its copying, for work with it is obligatory that it is a project for us, and from the people who said: The verse is indicative of what the violator went to; Because the freedom of the free is a bayyan and the interpretation of its saying: “He wrote to you with the killing of the killing, so it was indicated that the sponsorship of the priority in (Al -Hariyah and Al -Abdi” Al -Qasab) on (the free) by killing (the servant) is a thunderbolt of the pursuit of leveling in that sense, and this is required that the servant will not be killed except by the servant and does not kill the person only He did not go to him, and he is behind the phenomenon of the measurement and consensus, and whoever delivered this to us who claimed the transcription of the verse by saying the Almighty: that the soul is the soul; Because it is its general, the copying of the equality of equality in freedom and the maleity that benefits from it, and it is the narrator of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - The Shaabi, Al-Nakha’i, and Al-Tuari (P-50), and it was mentioned that the verse is the story of what is in the dew, and the pilgrimage of the story of the one before us, as it is not like that it is not.With it, and he stops that there is no contradiction in the Qur’an; If there was a people who were found for him; Let him delay him, so the story will be the story of the human being, and do not be a pilgrimage, as a virtue of being a dirt, and after the connotation of the connotation, it is not possible, as well Our Sadat Al -Hanafi, the Maliki, and a group went to the fact that the guardian has nothing but retribution, and the religion is not taken except with the satisfaction of the killer; Because God - exalted - was mentioned in the error of the religion, so that the punishment is that it is against the sin, which is the baptism, and when it is appointed by the pamphlet, it is amended from it; Like the increase in the text is not obligatory, and it is exposed to the fact that the texts of the text and the patronage of the sponsorship of equality in the pillars, and it does not require that the origin of the origin of the one, and the origin of the origin, The possibility with the way of equality requires their answers, so whoever pardoned him from his brother is something, that is: what is called something of forgiveness and hypocrisy, and if the lesser is less, then there is a little Al -Muwasouf, so his clothes may be from the active, and he has an effective with him, and from his brother, he may be attached to the act, It is permissible to be a state of anything, and in the establishment of something the act of the actor on a notice that some of the pardon is as if it is exempt from some blood or the pardon of it as a pardon, as well Quslaq; Because he is not fragmented, and what is meant by the brother of the blood is called a brother who is overwhelmed with the reminder of the brotherhood of the human being and the religion, and it was said: What is meant by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is intended to say: That is, from the blood of his brother, and his name is the murderer of the reference to the fact that the brother of Islam between them is not interrupted by the slander, and the pardon of the perpetrator and the escape of the escape ( And on his sins, and if it is prepared to the sin, it was intended, whether it was mentioned or not, as in the verse, it is prepared to the perpetrator (with the blame); Because the righteousness of the first and the benefit of the second, the intention is here to the crowning of the crime, except that it left its remembrance; Because the one who fulfills the perpetrator of the perpetrator, and some of them (on the authority of) this is inside something, but when you were deleted, he would benefit from his rituals, and he is a matter The shortcomings are with the hearing, and from the people who interpreted my pardon, then it is time, then it is a matter of time.The thing is in the sense that it is left, but the fixed was exempt, and it was answered that it was answered, and the imams of the language that are dependent on them in this matter, and it is not - The builder of the favorable to the verb that is the origin is the most likely to be adopted, and makes it the first of the famous, because it is the support of the unknown, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the original, And the saying that something is marrying by killing a deleted, indicating my pardon, which is not something; Because after adopting the meaning of forgiveness, there is no need for the meaning of the blessing, but it is a pillar as it is not hidden, so it is followed by the well -being and a performance of it with charity, that is, if only, and the one who is a good The will of the well -being is not to be tightened in the request of religion on the pierced for him and his view if he is an insolvent, and he does not ask him for the leadership of it, and the pierced is that it is not.And he pushes it at the place, and to this, the son of Abbas - may God be pleased with him - and goodness, mourning, and Mujahid, and it was said: What is meant is the one who has the pardon Its appreciation of its assets, the condition of the condition on the estimation of its condition, and perhaps it is inferred by the verse that the baptism is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the subject of the pods and alone; Where the matter was arranged by performing the religion on the pardon arranged on the top of the penalty, and some of them inferred from it that the religion is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not do the Extracting the comprehensive pardon for the pardon for all blood and some of it, but the satisfaction of the murderer is involved and its supplies by one, and it is exposed to the fact that it is not the same.For the immersion; Anything of pardon Its whole or some of it, but if it was to take it, then it was not; As the matter is the performance of some pardon, and there is no doubt that if it is achieved from blood, he becomes (P-51) the rest of the money, and if he does not accept the killer, and the verse is not, and the verse is in the good Objective to the mother, then if you seek it, it is with her, it is with her al -Badil; That is, whoever is given to him on the one hand of his brother, who is the one who has been given to him, for the one who is given, who is given and the one who is the one who claims to be a compliment and a good hand, Pardon) as it is the appearance of the word, and with it he said the most interpreters.That is: the ruling is mentioned in the guilt of the pardon of the pardon and the religion is reduced from your Lord and mercy for what is on the jocia of pardon For the loyalty of the murdered, and from a fighter that he (wrote) on Jews (Al -Qasab) and alone, and on the Christians (pardon) as a divorce, and he chooses this nation among the three of the three of the three And you download the judgment on the behalf of the homes, and on this, then whoever believes in the ruling of this project after the rule of the ruling was in the ruling, and the ruling was in the ruling.The story.Whoever takes after that, that is, it is permissible for what was done to be killed by the other killers after the arrival of this judgment, or the killing of the killer after (the pardon) That is: a type of torment is a painful, and the one who is repeated is that it is in the hereafter, and the narrator of the good and Ibn Jabir is that it is in the world that he is killed, and there is no one who does not accept it.David from the hadith of Samara Marifa:
