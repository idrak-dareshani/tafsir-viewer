The Quranic researcher is that the Qur’an is the saying of a messenger who informs him of God Almighty, for the Messenger does not say about his own as a generous person to God, glory and exalted, and he is the one who says: Ibn al -Sa’ib, Muqtiq and Ibn Qatibah, said: Jabril, peace be upon him, and his saying, is the Almighty, and what is the saying of a poet, etc.(P-53) The peace and blessings be upon him, a messenger, neither a poet nor a priest, as he feels this because of the descent and the clarification of that, that they did not say that they are in Jabril, and that is the peace of it They used to say it in the Prophet ﷺ, and if I would like the Messenger of a generous, peace be upon him, peace be upon him.Early, if you said, and what is the saying of courage, you have attracted what you deny and followed by some of the imams, that this is correct, if he is peace, that the meaning is to be proven by the one who is a person who is a person who is a person, not Exalted: It is the saying of a messenger, not a poet’s saying, as proof of the abuse of the way of the kinna, but if the intended is made from the context, the proof of the truth of the house, and it is the right of the house, Remembering a loudness and a misfortune to meet them, while he is a honesty and a durability that does not fast around him as a result of which it is shown after.For the second saying is also a good location, as if it was said that this Qur’an said Jabriel the generous messenger and what is the meeting of Muhammad ﷺ as well A poet and a priest, and he may have exiled from him ﷺ poetry and priesthood on the path of integration, and it is a good fulfillment.A little that you believe, that is, you believe that a little is a liquidation for the divorced effect To show his righteousness ﷺ to be believed to him, peace and blessings be upon him, in the sentence, and if they appear his disagreement with stubbornness, and his father, he wanted to go to the time On the enemy and negation, that is, you do not believe in the dirham, nor the words in it, except that it is the first in the back.And Abu Hayyan said: It is not intended to be a few, as it is the one who claims that it is only in the least of the least man who says like this, except for Zaid, and in the saying of a little In addition, it may be in a little and a few if they are two ways, we have what they have passed away in his saying: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ It was a few, and I was striking or a little.Little, if it is affected by the verb, it is not possible for many, and in a little, I was beaten that it is a source of export, so he needs to raise a few in the A position of lifting on the appetite uh.And you know That is, like that, it is not heard of the same as the time, without a sign, because the phenomenon is that he said what he said, except for a man, and he is the mare of the Lord of the Arab Those who are deleted, that is, a few time, you believe and that is what was said if they were asked whoever created them or who created the heavens and the earth, then they say then God.And Ibn Attiyah said, "We have a few with a reactions that are indicated by him who believe in and it is necessary to be a navigator, so their faith will be fulfilled, and it will be fulfilled, and it will be lost It is described by the few is the linguistic faith, and they have been believed in the things that are not a walk that does not enrich anything from them, such as the formation of the prayer and the chastity that was commanded by the prayer.It is followed by that it is not valid for a few with a reactions that indicate that they believe that it is either that it is what is estimated with it, so it is not the same, then the one is not the one who does not Likewise, he deleted what is permissible for what is permissible for him to destroy what he was more than more, and if it is a source, it was either in the position of raising, that is A little of your faith and rejects the obligation of his work from otherwise that you will be presented to him and his stabilization is not to him.It is a beginner with no news, because what was accepted by it is a man Ibn Katir, Ibn Amir, and Abu Amr, read the difference from them, the good and the Hurra “they believe” with the fulfillment of the distraction.
