The researcher of the Qurâ€™an is called and does not enrich the hunger, either in the place of the righteousness of the righteousness of the sacrifice, and the meaning is that their food is from something that is not from the human being This is a type of it that is alienated from it and does not bring it closer, and the food of the food is exile from it; And they are the pattern of hunger and the benefit of power and the heavens in the body, and if you want, say: It is from something that is deceived by it and it will be lost to God, and it will be raised to God, and it is called from God.And there is no food in it in the first place, or in the lifting of a liquid (P-114) for the "food" of the estimated; As stine: there is no food except food from a lump.The meaning is close to what is mentioned, and its universe is not a row for the male; As it does not indicate that their food is confined to the sacrifice, but rather indicates that what is not heard and does not enrich their food is confined to it and spoils the meaning.As for it, there is no place for him from the Arabs that he is in kind and the first appearance.It is narrated that the disbelievers of Quraysh said when they heard the version of the verse: The deprivation is to name our camels.She descended: He is not heard, etc.It was said: They do not leave either to lie or curse that of that, and he is the back, so he will return their saying with the exile of the thick The sweetener of your sacrifice, but it is not called and no hunger.And on the first, it is a confirmed adjective in response to what they claimed, not a detector; Because there is no hidden, and on the second is a special attribute, and whatever it is the fascinating of hunger to the compassion; That is, it is not enriched by hunger, and the delay in the negation of the enrichment of it to take into account the consultations and the consequences of it to the permissibility of the exile of both of the two things; If he was presented, he would not have been intended to the remembrance of the negation of the faithful, the harm of the negation of the negation of the hunger, and that is, and not to confirm the negation.And in the guidance: The two things denied it from it, it is not necessary for them to be in preparation for the sake and the name, except that it does not benefit anything from them, but rather that it is not prepared for it, nor is it to be prepared for it.This is achieved that their hunger and thirst are not before what the struggle is in this creation in a state of knowledge of the human being when the person is called to the domination He is tired of him to the dismissed and who is mentioned in which he is dedicated to them with the elderly and drink, and I seek to seek them from others when they are in the way A powerful power when they will be hungry, but their hunger is a phrase for their persecution when the fire is forced in their guts to the entry of something that is a thick thing that is so The flame, or that they have a longing to some person, and the virtue of it with the greatest, and seeking help from it from others and benefiting a force in it.Likewise, their thirst for their persecutions at the eaters of the hardships and its darkening in their stomachs to something cold, cold Let it be forgotten from them, so that they will be delicious with his drink or the benefit of a force in it in the sentence, and it is the meaning of what was narrated that it is the one who is the same Eating the sacrifice, then if they eat it, the thirst is overwhelmed with them, and they are obliged to drink the gums, so they will distort their faces and cut their blessings, God is the Almighty.I finish.It is the disagreement of the phenomenon, and the same is not said about the opinion and does not have it in what we have stopped on it.And the drink is that the goods and the thirst in the world have a lust for them, but they have had a way that the end of the end of God, the Almighty, the Almighty, the Lord, the Lord of the Lord So they are forced to do so, as it is obligatory for those who are overwhelmed by hunger and thirst in the world to the enemy of the bad one from the righteous and the evil of the one who is the one who is not.They take him, but they will be tormented by torment.We ask God to pardon and well -be of his own and generosity.
