The Quranic researcher sees the billion of the children of the fullness of the people: their faces and their honor, and it is a name for the group, no one has it from his memorization, and the origin of the door is not, but the door is not, but the door is not.The supervision was named; Because they are filling the breasts, or because they fill; That is, they take care of what is not more over it, and (from) to the metabolism, and the neighbor and the boring are attached to the deleted, and he signed a state of mortality after Moses: To seek, and it is attached to what is related to what he accepted, and the two letters are not harmful; To disagree with them, when they said to my Prophet to them, Abu Ubaidah said: It is Ashmil ibn Hanna ibn al -Aqir, and the most of the most, and the one who said: Ben Nuna, whoever was after before, and it is a phenomenon in communication, and he replied that this was a moses boy _ peace be upon them _ and between him and between the dawood of the verse, and there is a lot of people It is necessary, and (as) are attached to a guarantee that the position calls; That is, (did you not see) the story of the mortality or their hadith when they said: I send us a king, meaning: I stand for us as a prince, and the origin of the resurrection is the sake of the sides of the place that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who: With the disagreement of his attachment, it is said: The camel was sent from his blessing: if he raised it, and sent it in the walk: if it comes to it, and God will send the Almighty: if he lives, and he will come Excellencies with the arms (P-165), we fight in the path of God, as a result, and read the lifting of the state that it is an estimated state; That is: I send it to us, who are able to fight, or are inspired by a two -year -old; As if it was said: What do you do with the king?He answered: we fight, and read: fighting with a rewarding and exhausted on the answer to the matter and description of (king), and because of their request for that is what is in that Its walls are upset; Let God be exalted, and he will judge the victim, then its successor is like a core like that, then Hazakil is like that, then the same, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then The enemy of the people is the people of Golot, and they were the inhabitants of the sea of ​​the Romans between Egypt and Satin, and they appeared on them, and they dominated many of them Four -ups, and forty and forty people, and they were rewarded for them, and they took their humiliations, and there was no prophet for them if they were arranged, and they were the one who is the one who is a matter Except a woman of my rope, and she was born with a boy, and she was named Ashmawil, and it is: Asmail, and it was said: Shamsoun, so when he grew up, he was blessed with him, And a sheikh of their scholars guaranteed him, so when he grew up, God Almighty, and sent him to them, and they said: If you are honest; So we sent the king of the verse, and the sons of the sons of the children of Israel were to meet on the Malouk, and the obedience of their prophets, and it was The king is the one who walks with the collection, and the Prophet is the one who establishes his command, and guides him, and he indicates to him.That you do not fight) and the condition was separated by it, and the meaning: Did you not fight against as I signed it from you, and what is meant is that it is reported that the signed is the one who is signed, It was assumed that you are not fighting with its meaning: it is signed by the number of the fighting, and (what) is not understood by it except when it entered it, so it will be the one who is not.The signed, and it is not necessary to report that the signed is fixed, but the signature is being, and where is this from that?!I answer that the interrogation entered a sentence that is signed and signed, and there is no way to the first; Because the man does not understand his location, so he is to be from the signed, and when the questioning was on the path of the report; It was intended that the signed is a being, and it was said: when you were perhaps to create the signature, and do not come out of it; The arbitrary understanding was made to the signed, and it is the news that is the place of the good, so it was decided and proven, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one A whole, and it was said: If it is not from the dirty, it has been included in the meaning That is in the entry of the interrogation on it, and its fall is a news in his saying: I do not abound that I am a fasting person and does not hide what is in it, but rather it is mentioned in the disposal They are, with it, as it appeared to be attached to their words; They are in the way that they succeeded them, for if they do not fight at the satisfaction of the fight against them, with the affirmation of God Almighty; Because they are not fighting at the time of his satisfaction, and because what they mentioned, perhaps they are delusional that the reason for their successors is the distress, and we do not have the soul of the fighting, and this is the same.Ray until that resurrection is the one who is left to the fight, if it is located, but it falls on the face that arranges for it for the satisfaction.We do not fight in the path of God, that is: What is the reason for us until we do not fight?That is, to the leaving of the fighting, and the neighbor and the boundaries are attached to what is related to it (for us), or with it itself, and it is a news about (what), and you entered the waw to be informed of the words of this It was done to be done to be cut off from it, the father said it, and it was permissible to be an adulterer on the deletion; As if they said: The rest of the fighting is not sought from us, and we do not fight.Al -Tarib: We do not do or do not do, on that The sentence is a state, and when it is forbidden from that here, the source is not agreed upon by the adultery in which the adultery is agreed upon, and the fear claimed (P-166) is an increase (that) and that the work is not.The case, as in the shame, and it was said: It is on the authority of the waw, and it is interpreted to: what we have and that we do not fight; As you say: You are to speak, and it may be said: You will speak, and the meaning is on waw, and it was said: What is here is navigator; That is, we have no left, and our children have been brought out to our path and our children in the position of the situation, and the worker (we fight) and the exhibition of the news that they are fighting, there is no way, when he did not.Positively strong, which is the one who is from the elderly, the expropriation of the people and the children, and the individuals of the masculinity; For the more strengthening the reasons for the fighting, and it is turned over to the pilgrim, and in it a deletion is added when the father of the survival; That is: and among our children, and it was said: There is no deletion, and the compassion is on the same The fighting was written upon them after the question of the Prophet and sent the king; They took over and lost the command of God Almighty, but not in the matter of the matter, but after the scene of the many enemy and its disturbance, as it will come, but it will come, but it will come, but it will come.Jamal; Showing what is between their saying and their actions from inconsistency and the evolution except for a little of them and they are the ones who visited the river, and they were three and three of them Al -Bukhari was brought out, on the authority of Al -Barah _ may God be pleased with him _ and the minority is additional, so he does not want and describes this number sometimes that it is a forgiveness and God knows best They wronged the length of the fighting and the leaving of jihad, and their words and their acts were contradictory, and the total is a sacrifice that I want from the bond.
