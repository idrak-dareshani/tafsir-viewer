The Quranic researcher, God is no god but he is a beginner and a news, and what is meant is the one who deserves the slave, not otherwise, it was said: And for people in raising the destroyed in the way, then in the name Five sayings of five sayings: they say they are considered, and three are not dependent on them, so the arrogant saying: one of them: that it is raised by the ramiya, and the second one, and the second: The expertise and the first is the neighbor on the Sunnah of the Arabs, and he is the opinion of the son of Malik, and he is either appreciated by the last or not, and those who say the ability to be lost; It is an estimated general matter, such as existence and places; And from the value of all of us and for creation, and the general estimation of the public was subjected to that one of the two warnings is obligatory from it, either the fact that the provision of the provision of the verb is the same Its praise is emanating from the possibility of the company, and so is the ability In terms of existence, because the exile of the existence is required, the denial of the possibility is that if no other individual was described by the wilderness of the existence, there is no harm He knew that he was described by him and what he did not describe as the journey of goodness, and he could not describe him to the impersonation It appeared that it is possible to equate anything with the duty of existence, and its equity is required by the act of the harmful It is impossible to be the obligation of the existence that it has been mentioned other than that, that the exile of the gods of God is not exalted, it is permissible for it to be the arrangement of it It is one of the most in the most varying, and if they did not know the negation of it, but with the negligence and the number of the feeling of it, then it is not harmful to the connotation of the word, but he said: And the god is other than God, the exaggeration of the supply, and its worshipers have risen on a leg, and the partners have worked on it, so the people were commanded by the people of the people There is a truth, and if there were people, they would say that there is no right, other than the exalted, but it is not the same as the one who is in the first place.The tenderness is in a place, and the answer can be made by going to be appreciated, especially that that private is attached to worship and the place of the century, and it is clear to him, and it is not upon him, and it is not upon him None of the places, nor by the act of the existence of God, otherwise, the grace of it is not worthy of worship, and that it can be said: the intention is that the one who is intended is the one who does not.With the act or the place, and the first: the place is not denied, and the second: it does not indicate its investigation, the Almighty, and it is answered that it is the one who is known that it is the same There is no doubt that it requires the investigator of exaltation and the exemption, and there is no meaning for the investigator of worship, so if it is not worthy of it, it is not possible for it to be exalted.He deserved the worship in cutting, and if it is not found, it is not possible as well as what was indicated to me, so it has proven that the negation of the investigator is necessary.And those who say that the number of (P-6) is the ability of the news that the greater of them is the fact that (no) this is not informed of it, and it was assumed that it is necessary for the time to be fulfilled, and the ruling is that the ruling is This is the fulfillment of the unicorn, and it is answered that the saying is the same as the argument, the compound is not removed from not from the contract, because this is the one who is the one who is the same When these are in the sense that it is not a follower of the place of the name (no), and its expression appeared in its afternoon, and there is no field to make it for the sacrifice, if it was not for it, if it is for it, if it is for it, if it is for it.He will have it at that time, that this race is on the ability of the entry of this individual in which there is a tributary, so it is understood from it, so that the individuals of others are exhausted from it Judaism as it is not hidden.The dispensation was formed from two directions, the first: that it is a bit of one and there is no guarantee for the exchange of it, and it is a condition in it, the second: that between them is contrary, then it is not obligatory.And it is answered from the first: that (except) she sings about the destiny for her bitten understanding, and on the second: that it is a substitute for the first in the work of the worker, and the violation of the person in the way of the mind, and the violation of the affliction and the absence of the affliction and the absence of the affliction and the absence of the affliction and the absence On the authority of it, if it was said: The substitutes are in the jurisprudence of the same time.And the second: From the first two words, which is the saying of the experience of the time after (except) went to a group and weakened that it is necessary to do (no) in the knowledge and it is not in the knowledge that it does not do it (Except) special, how can it be a news, and they have said: by the abuse of the animal as a human being, and it is answered from the first: that (no) does not work for it in the news of the opinion of it What was permeated by him before he did not have to work in the acquaintance while he was seen.The marketer of the general, and the specialization of the one of the individuals of what is indicated by the public and in which there is in it.As for the three sayings that are not dependent on it, the first is: that (except) is not a tool of an affliction, but it is in the sense of others and it is with his name, there is no right The solution, and the estimation is not God, other than God, in existence, and the second: and we have been attributed to the obligation that there is no deity in the position of the news and (except) and what is after it in the place of it Or God is a god, when I want the palace of the description on the descriptions, the news was presented and the beginning of the beginning with the other The one who follows (except) and the shortcoming is the fall in the context of the negation, and the beginning if it is established with the only ones that must be presented to it as it was decided in the place of it, and it is not in the place of it.Marva with God, as is the case of the beginning, if it is a description, because there is a god in the sense of his God, and he will be the one who is the status of the actor, and a lion of the news, as in what is in what is in what is in what is in what is in what is in what is in what is That there is a violation of the meaning of the meaning, because the intended of the word is a matter of deity, other than the Almighty, and its evidence has it for him, and this is only if it is) The negation and the evidence will benefit from the time, and if it is in a sense other than that, the words are not beneficial to its humanity, except for the deity of the God, and the absence of it, and it is not.His name is not beneficial from the installation and its benefit from the concepts, it is hardly accepted because if it is a concept of a neck, then there is no transmission with it, and the one who does not do it.He only said about it, and some of the hampels, and if it is a row concept, then it is clear that it is not unanimous, and it is returned to the second: that it is from the second: from the second: That the news is built with (no) and it is not built with it except the beginning, and also if it was the matter as it was mentioned, it was not for the sake of the name of this (only) A face, and his possession has been in it in a group, and on the third: We do not surrender that God is a description, otherwise it is obligatory to express it and its identification, nor say it.This is for me, if God wills, after the adherence to what is in this good word from the words.And in his words, the Almighty: The neighborhood is seven of the faces of the Arabs: The first: that it is a second news to the majestic memorial, the second: that it will be a news of the beginning, that is, it is the beginning of the beginning The third: that it is an instead of his saying, his grace: There is no god but He, the Fourth: to be (P-7) as a substitute for (he) and alone, the fifth: that he is not a start Take it, the sixth: that it is a substitute from (God), the following is that it is a row for him and his readers are supported by the sake of praise for his choice, and in his etc.The first: that his origin is alive with two people from a neighborhood, and the second: that he is alive, so the broken waw was broken by what he accepted, and for this, and for that The journalist is alerting him to this origin, and the animal supports him to appear this in it, and it was decorated.And life for the patronage is the pursuit of the generous domestication that the wicked forces or the strength of the feeding or the power of the power or the power of the sense The sense and the movement, and everyone is what is forbidden to be exalted, because it is one of the attributes of the Jesusids, in which he is in which he will be a row of a ritual, not a true person who is not true.Its she is dominated by his being and does not know her truth, as his attributes, the same as his affairs, is an increase in the group of science and capacity, and there is no soul.It is struggling and not angry, as it was said by all, so it is a soul that has that of that adjective, and it was interpreted by some of those who speak to them ((by the one who is correct That this destiny has all the animals, so how is it good for God to praise his soul with a description that he shares with it, the brother of the tales, then he said: The origin of the language is not a expressive of the soul of this health, but everything was complete in his gender, he is called alive that it is not seen that the life of the earth is called the life of the righteousness.The recognition of the speakers is a life, but it was called because it is like the body of the body that it is described in that adjective, so there is no crime that is called that, and that is the same as the righteousness, A vegetable, so that this situation is called life.From alive is the whole, and when it was not a restriction that indicates that it is complete on divorce, and the whole is like that, whoever is not subject to the same, neither in itself nor in its attributes of the right Delicious and additional)) It is not hidden that it is a discourse that is repeated from the bottles, but first: because his saying: The neighborhood in the sense of the one who is correct to know and appreciate what is bought by him To praise God for his soul in the end of the stroke, because if he wants to persevere in the release of the memorizers, it is not alive, and it is not like that, but the hearing and the good Launching the brother of the tallness, and the praise of God, the Almighty, has not been the same and the people of the Sunnah were not formed.In it is a fraud between the dust and the Lord of the arms, and between the eternal and the Zayyal, and when did you say that the partner is in the release of the memorizers, that is required of the insignificance, and it is not true, and there is no truth The metaphor for you is like that in the path of adjectives and does not say that it is from the people of the Sunnah.In the first place, but I have been fixed in it, and it is described by the beauty of it, but it is on the way of the metaphor without the truth as it is as they are, if it is said: It is a metaphor in God Almighty The partnership in the fullness with the gates is a preference for the animal, then if he said: As the blame of everything in the lineage, to what we say to our sayings: the life of every neighborhood of the right of the right Likewise, the same is the highest thing, as if I had a understanding of My words of miles to the flame of the previous in the same way as these citizens, so that this is the understanding of the people all the people.Until the shoes of India and the land of it with a gift and the obligatory That there is something in the heart, and perhaps from behind the prohibition for that, we are narrated from Qutdah that he who does not die while he is not a text in the claimant.Al-Qudum is a form of exaggeration for the resurrection, and its origin is Qiom, so it is a decree, so the waw and the ya were broken, and they were preceded by the silence, so the wow was turned around (P-8) It is not permissible to be an action, otherwise it is a force because it is Wawy, and it is permissible for him in it.(Al -Aqam) and (Al -Qayyim) with the instance and its meaning, as the laughter and Ibn Jabir said: the good and the existing servants, and it was said: Their construction of their livelihoods and the delivery of their livelihoods to them, and he is the one who is about to be a murderer and it was said: He is the scientist with matters from their saying, so that he does not do what he knows, and he said: The sustainable is the resurrection of the manner of creation and his memorization, and the desire mentioned that it is said: he rose like that, as long as he did and did so that he kept it, and the resurrection of the righteous, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the right, Its strength, and the most promising from it is that doing in the sense of the permanence and then becomes enemy in the sense of perpetuation, which is the preservation, so he mentioned that the vulnerability is not from the rituals The values ​​of its tool was in the sense of the obligatory, so it is not valid to interpret it with the preservation, then the exaggeration in the keepers how can it be to give the giving of what is in it, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Rather, he is fulfilled by that, as it is not hidden, and he is mentioned on his interpretation of the grace of the existing, in the same way, that it is the meaning of the lives of the heavens and the exterminated in the ritual in the manner The land is as it is seen, so it appears that it is in it in another way, which is worthy of, as it is only valid for the numbers of a laughing.Jummy went to the fact that al -Qaymum is the name of God, the Almighty, and his interpretation is that he is the one who is standing in the same way The seizure of all the tuitions and the removal of the sacrifice of the deficiency, and made the evaluation of others, joining all the verbs of the verb, so that the act of the verb is true.And the strangeness of the sayings is that it is a Sirian memorial and its meaning in the secret that does not sleep, and its distance is not hidden because it is repeated then in the saying The Sunnah of the Sunnah is a break of the first of which is a light that is presented as the sleep, and there is no sleep for the saying of Adi ibn al -Raqaa: With the impermissibility of the perception, the perception is presented The vitality is from the lavishness of the nerves of the brain from the beverages of the righteous, where the phenomenon is standing from the senses of the head, and the grace of the sake is in It is a smell of air that is blowing from the threshold And the measuring of the exaggeration requires the delay in observance of the prestige of the proof, so that it may be presented to the day in the out of the outside.He is notified of the confirmation in which he has the exile of the Sunnah, it requires the denial of the sleep as a guarantee.In which there is a consciousness in which the good and the feast of the lighter is the lighter.On the surname and the inclusion of negation for each of them, and it was said: The delay of the sleep is a pursuit of the communities and is not hidden that it is from the narrowness of the gift, and he said some of the investigators: To him, if he is taken in the sense of supplies and supplications, and if he is taken in the sense of oppression and prevalence, as the ritual mentioned it and others from the imams of the language: Dear farewell, so the synchronization is required, as the meaning is the Sunnah, nor the sleep, which is the most dominant of it.And the sentence is a negation of the suspicion and its promotion to it, to have an example of it from life because it is not devoid of that Because the sleep is a wise man that contradicts the time of life, its survival and attributes, the exalted is a valuable, and it is still for it, and because those who are afflicted with the sleep and the dungeon are not the obligation of the existence of the existence of no He preserved the power of the memorizer, and the son of Abu Hatim was brought out and others from the son of Abbas (P-9), may God be pleased with them.They fear God Almighty, and His Lord called him, Moses.To kneel him, then he was refreshing, so they set them up, even if the last night was miserable, and the two bottles were broken, and they were broken, so he said: Oh Moses, if I was sleeping.And the land is that, as the two bottles have been destroyed in your hands.Among the guarantors who are reluctant to be rested, and it is permissible to be a news about alive or from the generous name.He has what is in the heavens and what is in the earth is a report of its resurrection, the high and the height of its reluctance in the divine, and what is meant by what is is what it is Yes, among their parts are within them, and from the things that are outside them, who are able to be in them from the minds, and others, so he knows from the verse, the denial The stars, the angels, the idols, and the gods are due to worship.Whoever intercede for him except with his permission is a denial, and therefore it has entered (except) and the intended of it is that it is a pride of it, and it is not the same.It takes down to pay what he wants to pay on the side of the rush, the possibility, and the subjugation, as a matter of being taken to pay it, and the positions of the For atonement, where they claimed that their gods are a lip of them for them, God Almighty knows what is between their hands, that is, the matter of the world And others, and it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, and the mourning of this is the opposite of that, and it was said: He knew what was before them and what was from them, Evil and what they have left from what they did, like that, and it was said: What they realize and what they do not realize or what they feel and understand it, and all is an inner He returns to what is in the heavens, etc., except that he is overwhelmed by those who are reasonable for others, and it was said: The minds have in his guilt, so do not be overlooked, and it is permissible to return from what he returns from And the prophets, and it was said: The prophet is in particular, and the knowledge is among their hands and what they left as a way to surround his knowledge of his grace, and the sentence is either a matter (He is interceding) or from the mourning in (with his ear).And they do not surround anything from his knowledge, that is, his knowledge, as they say: O God, forgive us with your knowledge of us, and surround the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge One of these things was something of its information, except for what he wants to know, and it is permissible to want (from his knowledge) his own knowledge, and he is all in the unseen, so there is no absence, so there is no Those who are a messenger and their sentence were satisfied with what he accepted for her to make her to him because that is because he feels that he knows that he does not know that he does not know anything Other than it and their group indicates that it is exaggerated by the knowledge that is one of the assets of the attributes of the blades that must be described by God.His chairs expanded the heavens and the Earth is a body between the hands of the throne, surrounded by the seventy heavens, and the son of Jarir and Ibn al -Mudar al -Munadi from the authority God Almighty said: “If the seventh heavens and the seventh are the seventh of the seventh, then they were prayed for some of what was in his capacity, that is, in the end of the righteous Violence, which is not the throne, as it is indicated by what Ibn Jarir and Abu al -Sheikh and Ibn He wanted him on the authority of Abu Dhrara, “He asked the Prophet ﷺ about the Karsi, and he said:“ O Abu Dhur, what are the seven heavens, and the seventh is the seventh of the chair, except for the sake And that the preference of the throne over the Karsi is the preference of the prayer over that throat.The Prophet ﷺ on his saying of the Almighty: His chairs expanded, etc."He said: His chair is the position of his feet and the throne is not appreciated by his destiny.It was said: The power of God is the Almighty, and it was said: His mobilization, and it was said: a king of his angels, and it was said: It is metaphor for science from the name of the thing in the place of which is the place of the place of the place of the place of the place of the place of the place Knowledge is a place for knowledge by his awareness, because the offer follows the place in the partisanship until they went to the fact that the meaning of the present is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one May God be pleased with them, and it was said: The king is taking from the king of the king, and it was said: The origin of the Karsi is what is simplified The representation of his greatness, the highness of his sting, and his knowledge of his knowledge as a whole.The slopes, and this is the one who was chosen by the largest of the successor, with the illusion of embodiment, and they carried the hadiths that the appearance of the chair is on the authority of the body, not the one who is the same Early the hadiths in which the remembrance of the old is presented as it is presented, and as the hadith that al -Bayahqi has brought out and others from my father Moses Al -Ashri, Al -Karsi: Mawzal Al -Qaddam The nomads; And his proverbs is not with the strong preacher of the Kurdish exile in the whole of the whole, so the truth is that it is fixed as the authenticity of the authentic news is that the authenticity is in the validity of the authenticity, and it is not the delude it.The exile of many of the attributes is isolated from the followers of the street and the peace of it, and the most righteous predecessors have made that from the simplicity of the one who does not know.His knowledge to God Almighty with the saying of the abuse of impure and the sanctification has the Almighty.And those who say the appearances of our Sufi masters.The sentence of actual attributes is an appearance of divine and the place of influence of the matter, the end, the creation, and the hostility that is expressed by the two feet, and the end of the heavens and the sake of the heavens And my judgment was expanded because their presence is restricted by the effects of the actual attributes that is an appearance And there are no evidence in the hadiths of the two feet of the two men and the place of the two people, may God Almighty bless him from that of this is great, and not “the most heard of God.” Al -Shahid, rather, is - if his knowledge is not delegated to the expert knowledge - a reference to the emergence of opposing things or their confusion in that appearance that is the origin of the one who is the origin of the Creativity, numbers, and the focus of harm, benefit, separation, and collection, and the meaning of what is preferred from it except for the fourth of the parking if the destiny is back to the nomad The presence of civilizations is the most famous for some of the names, and it did not emerge to the world of sense, and it is not possible to see it except for those who born two times, and the one who wants to be one of you is the one who is the one who is more And for those who are in this place, there are no other words, and perhaps we refer to some of it, if God wills exalted.ثُمَّ المَشْهُورُ أنَّ الياءَ في الكُرْسِيِّ

its collection is my brochure, my slaughter and my brother, in which there are two languages, which are sufficient, which is the most famous, and its fraction is to follow, and the grave is on the authority of the wow, On the authority of his actor and the Kurds, he was read by the cunning of the Sunnah with the breaking of the waw as a knowledge in a knowledge, and the opening of the waw, the cinema and the lifting of the eyes with the sins of the eyes The heavens, then it is a beginner that is added to what is after it and (the heavens and the earth) his news.He does not want him, that is, he does not lose it as Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said, and he is taken from the sons in the sense of Al -Awwaj, because he is the one who has the same.And the guarantee of God Almighty.It was said: the Kersi.They kept them (P-11), that is, the heavens and the earth, but it was not exposed to the remembrance of what is in them, because their memorization was followed by its memorization, and they are in the authority of the remembrance of the remembrance Their memorization is the perceived viewer, and the saying of the traumatic to enter it and the throne, and others are what he knows only by God, with a long time, which is the one who is the one who is the one who is والأمْثالِ والأضْدادِ وعَنْ أماراتِ النَّقْصِ ودَلالاتِ الحُدُوثِ, وقِيلَ: هو مِنَ العُلُوِّ الَّذِي

the platform of this generous verse of divine issues, and they were broken on their lips, the lights of the high attributes, where they gathered from the rituals of the rituals of the rituals of the righteousness The nests, life, science, king, ability and will, and the seventh of the seventh of the seventh of which is placed in the name of God, the exalted, the most important in the end of it, and it is in the end of it.Glory to him A single in its districts is alive, and it is necessary for the existence of its own, which is found to be the one who is distinguished from the partner, and the solutions are unaware of the absence and the absence of the one who is not.It is permissible in the area of ​​its majesty, which is presented to the souls and the souls, the king of the king and the king, and the creator of the origins and the bouquets, with the oppression of the world, and the one who is the same and the one who is the same Its part and the extension of the king and the ability for everything that is to possess and appreciate it, and it is not difficult for him to be hard for him and does not have anything to do with him.The bird of thought cannot be used to fast in the adjectives of which she did not, and she was unique with hearts, and the virtues of which the sisters of their sisters have given themselves, and they are not in the absence My son and happiness are threatened.A Muslim and Hamad was delayed, and others are from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: “The greatest verse in the Qur’an is the verse The chair is in the arms of every prayer that is written to the last prayer and is not preserved except for a prophet, a friend or a martyr.He said: “If you know what you have, you would not have left it in a state of the Messenger of God ﷺ He said:“ The verse of the Karsi was given from a treasure under the throne, and it was not the same.” Its virtue is a many months, except that some of it is not all of it as a news.The time is, "and some of it is very denied as a news.The arrangement of every prayer is written, I make it the heart of the Shakrin, and the tongue of the male, the reward of the captains, and the will of the righteous.It is not hidden that the most hadiths in this chapter are a pilgrimage to those who said: Some Qur’an may be preferred to otherwise, and it is a disagreement, so he prevented him as well It is possible to make it the lack of the preference and the words of God, the Almighty, in which we do not shorten it, and the first is great with great and preferred to be virtuous, and it was permissible to be crushed by Ibn Ra’i And the speakers, who are the deceased, and return to the great reward of his reader, and may God be up to be specialized in what he wants with what he wants.And the appropriateness of this generous verse because of what he accepted is that he was given it when he mentioned that the disbelievers are unjust to be alerted them to the authority of the one who is true The incitement of the neutrality, which the messengers of the sedimentary of their grades, and their measuits were removed from what is forbidden by that of that, and the one who has been bright

and its signs, we are filled with the one who lives on you, in the face of the right to the right that is not the one who does not The messengers who crossed these residences (P-12) and they were correct for them to shut up those messengers.Whoever spoke to God when you will send him on his heart and in my family his secret and raised some of them with grades with his death from the injustice

needed, and they did not.Al -Alami is only the neighborhood whose life has its own life and everything that is alive and only with his lives that are resurrected that he performs himself and sets out everything that is based on him His life is the secrets of the united, so they unit with it, and the values ​​who were pleased to see the characteristics and revelation of the souls, the souls of
