The Quranic researcher is divided into the Lord of the Mashrq and the Maghreb, that is, if the matter is as we mentioned that their creation is what they know, which is the dirty sperm, then I do not divide They are able to change their goodness, that is, to destroy them with time, according to their felonies, and we will bring them with other creation.They are not on their ranks, and we are not in their ranks.Their punishment is in it, and it is a matter of distance, and perhaps the closeness, as it is in the sense of the explanation, but on the face of which the owner of the revelation decided that the words of the revelation said: The reason for their denunciation is the one where the remembrance of its evidence is with the denial, so the reason for the cause is established by the place of the cause of the ritual of the ritual.It is from the beginning that it contradicts the state of those who do not prove it, as it was said that he denies the resurrection (because I) faces his hearing and transgresses them with the creation On the creation of their example, in which they are accustomed to them and alert it to the place of their contradictions, then the mockery of the end and the heaven is in the entry of the time The power of the power is close to what was before it while he was in the truth, a bridle, and from which it is known that what was said in his saying is that it is that it is not for me.It is with me that we are able to give Muhammad ﷺ who is better than them and they are the supporters that are not in that and in expressing the material of their creation with what he knows what he knows The arrogant who are not hidden, and what is meant by the Mashharq and the Ghareeb, the sun of the sun, the sons, and its hardships, as well, or the Mashrab, and the sunsets of the sun, Or the roofs of the wives and its hardships are divorced as it was said and went with them until the intention is the Lord of the creatures with its families and the words in the way of the division of the time and the rest of it.Without a thousand and Abdullah bin Muslim and Ibn Muhaisn, and Al -Jahiri, “Al -Mashrah and Al -Maghrib”.
