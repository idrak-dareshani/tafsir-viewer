The researcher said: Glory be to you, there is no knowledge of us except what you have taught us, and it is signed by the fall of the answer, as if it was said: So what did they say then: Do they come out of the custody?It was said: They said, etc., and one is mentioned that one of the camels opened with the saying if it was arranged for some of it in the sense, then it is not correct in it, so it is not correct in it.With the meaning, and it came in the surah of the poets from that many, but the Qur’an is fill from it, (and the grace).We go out, and it is hardly used to be added, either for the verb, or the actor is erected by adding an act and a duty, and he said: “Glory be to him, then we will see it.” The good and the grandfather is an anomaly like his saying: Glory be to you, O God, with the Glory, and his coming calling for what is the sacrifice of the sacrifice of it, and there is no argument for him, and he gathered a group that is a group of people.Duration, there is no source praising in the sense that he said: Glory be to God, so that the role is required, and because the consequences of that are noticeable, and this is a meaning With his saying: I have said when he came to me, and they were blessed with the relationship Scientific, and it is answered that they are in it on the authority of the addition to it, that is, the grace of God, and it is intended to know about it, and the remains are added to him, and it is in the case On the authority of the two, and it was said: from an increase and the addition of what is after it is controlled, and the mockery of it, and from the strange, the saying of some: the meaning of you, the meaning of you.As they said in your heart an answer after an answer, and it is necessary for this appearance to be a garment, and its individuality is praise, and that it is not a tendency, but it is a mourning, and that it is not a mourning For the addition, but the adultery is open, and the Glory of God, the Almighty, for those who say that, and the abuse of this answer is the best of the miracle of the matter of disagreement, He notified a face, as if they said: There is no knowledge of us except what you taught us, and we did not teach us the names, so how do we know it, and there is a notice that their question was not only The way of learning, and from his sentences, their knowledge of the ruling of the use of what was presented, then it is the way of learning too, so the question is the question that is not the question of the Absolutely, and a blessing upon him, with what they have overlooked with the end of the inconvenience, the observance of literature, and the abandonment of the preacher, and this is all that they did not say that there is no knowledge of us The back is that, and whoever claims the number of infallibility, he made this repentance, and the fairness is that it resembles it, but (P-227) is not from the sin of the disobedience, but it is from the authority of the disobedience.Their status, and raising their position, as the one who lives in their condition is on the facts that They leave the exposure and stand standing, because the fact of the situation appears, (and what) when the masses are the proximity of its master, and it is either in the authority of the authority, and it is either in the authority of the authority, and it is either.Or a set on the charity and narrated Ibn Attiyah on the authority of Al -Zahrawi that it is in the position of a set (with our knowledge), and it is costing to find it.It is only in the sense of but, and it is not conditional, and the answer is deleted, as if they were depleted first of the paths of the science That is the most abolition of the allegiance of the preacher as it is not hidden, you are the wise knowledge Hand over his full descriptions and exalted him with description with wisdom, when it is clear to them what was clear, and the origin of the prohibited wisdom and the rule of it is the ruling of it, because the ruling of the bear, because it is the ruling of the bear, It is said that knowledge is that it is forbidden to commit falsehood, and to perceive the act to prevent it from the way of corruption and symptoms, and it is the intention of here, for the sake of it, so that it does not The rule, and it was said: The self, or the actor for what is not made to it was one of the verbs of the verb, so they understand, and the grace of the description was presented by knowledge on the description of the rule of the authority of the authority of the And (there is no knowledge of us), and because the rule does not exceed the knowledge, and that the last of their article is contrary to what is delusional from the first of it, (and you) is not the same On the famous, it benefits the affirmation of the judgment, and the shortfall that is beneficial from the curiosity of the chain of transmission, and it was said: It is an affirmation of the report of the chain of transmission to it, and it is not in the way of what is not The rumor, and it was said: the beginning of his news after it, (and the wise) is either a news after a news, or it was called it, and the attachment of their attachment to the benefit of the uncle, and the one who said: The knowledge of what you commanded and forbade, the wise when you spent and appreciated, and the general is first.
