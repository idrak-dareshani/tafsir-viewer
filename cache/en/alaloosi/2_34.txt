The researcher, when we said to the angels, find that the shadow is attached to the extent that the words indicated, as they were, and they were obedient, and the kindness of the kindness of the story, and the story of the story The blessing is with the fact that the first is a realization of the preference, and this is a confession to it, and the kindness of the custody is not valid on the custody of building on the righteous who has provided it, and the one who has provided it, On the basis of the precedent with an estimated, and the prostration in the origin is humiliated with a scare of curvature, otherwise, and in the law: put the forehead on the purpose of the custodian, and in the custodian, and in the sake Here is a disagreement, and it is said: The legal meaning and the prostration of it in the truth is God Almighty, and I have either before him or a reason, and it is assumed that if he was not so, he was not.On the authority of him, peace be upon him, and the Almighty said: I saw you, this who honored me that is indicated by him, do you not see that the kaab is not?And I answer the confusion of the matter on Pliss, and that the crime makes it a side of this worship without them, and it is not hidden from what is in the sign of the greatness, as well as the greatness A kiss between the elderly of the people, and from the people who passed the time of the prostration to him, Adam, peace be upon him, is a right, claiming that the prostration of the one who is the one who is in the face And in it that the lawful prostration is worshipers, and the worship of it is a blessing that is forbidden in all the foregrounds and eloquences, and I have not seen it in the era of the hurricane, and it is said: It is in it (P-229) is the forehead, but it was angry, humiliated, and perfect, so the blame is either the remaining on its appearance, or in the sense of it, the same in the saying of God: The first person who prayed for your kisses and known to the people of the Qur’an and the Sunnah or for the captivity, the same in its saying, the highest: the ritual of the prayer of the ritual With the prostration, the emergence of the confession with the grace of peace be upon him, and the apology for what they said in it with the sign until the right of those who are afflicted with those who taught him the truth Al -Asboub, where he said first: And when your Lord said here, and when we said, adding the greatness, because in the first, Adam created and disagreed with him, so the remembrance of the Lord is added to the sake of the Lord, to the Lord of the Here is the place of the income of an order that suits the greatness, and also in the prostration of greatness, so when he commanded his act to others, he referred to his rich arrogance from the rich of In the face of the angels, it is a follower of the inhabitants of the gym, which is a language of a hardship, and it is a strange language, and it is not in mistake as the Farisi thought, so it was a woman, so it was a woman, so it was a woman.With a man, and she said: The woman is in the woman, you want to be in the woman.So they found only the loyalty of the fulfillment of their storm From the knowledge of the scientific, and the legend, and its adultery is a verb said by al -Zajaj, and the father of Ubaidah said and others: He is an Arab who is derived from the slander, From the mercy of God Almighty, and his adultery on this is an effective, and his prevention from the flags at that time for his being, there is no theorist for him in the names, and it is assumed that it is that it is not.With that he has grooves, such as solutions and eaters, and in it a view, and it was said: Because he is a young man with the glory of the diligence, as no one is called by one of the people, and no In it, is it from the angel or from the jinn?So he went to the second group, who are inferred by the Almighty saying: Except for a Polis, he was from hein, and that the angels are not arrogant, and he has been arrogant, and that the angels have been arrogant.Aisha, may God be pleased with her, was created from the light, and heaven created from a fire from fire, and he was created from what was created by heaven, as it is indicated by the saying of it.You created me from the fire and created it from clay and the promise of the prostration of the prostration as fathers, and it was dominated at that time, either because it was arising from the angels, and it is a mourning of it, The matter, and it was not conceded, or because the heng was also a commandment with the angels, but he took advantage of their remembrance for the more honorable of them.The curse was a slim commander, not a guilt, as he refers to him, the appearance of his words, the Almighty: as I commanded you and a redeem From the companions and the followers to the first, inferred by the vicinity of the discretion, and correct it with what is mentioned, because it was one of them, but it was a head, but it was a head, but it was It has the effects, so it was not a vocalist between them, and because the anguish was shown to the divorce of the commanders with the end of the distance, it did not prove, when it was not proven, when it was not.So, Pliess, and his universe is a good thing, the verse is unhappy in it, and without his proof the mail of murderer, and it is necessary to be removed from the verse as the one who is from the time He wants to be acting from them, and his saying is soaked as his children, and it is permissible for him to be in the sense that it became, as it was narrated that it is a miserable Grandy, as Jews are dirty, they became a monkey and a pig, peace, but there is no contradiction between his being a jinn, and his son is a king, for the sake of the king, for the sake of the king, for the sake of what is The king is said to be said to him about what was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them The angels are like us, or it is said to the angels as well as the son of Isaac said to them and their hurts from the eyes of the people, and with you (P-23) His saying: And they made between him and between paradise a lineage and he wanted the same in the words of the Arab The resurrection of his children do without a reward and the place of the angels who are not arrogant, and he has been arrogant and does not harm, either because from the angels who are not the dignity On the opposite of us, and in the horse of Abu Al -Mu’in Al -Nassafi, what supports that, or because the Plots of God, the Exalted of the Holieth, and the dress of the rituals of the rituals, When that, as long as the king is a king who does not disobey.And who is the one who does not change, and his being is created from fire and they are created from a light that is not harmful as well, and there is no sacrifice in his king And their disagreement with the symptoms that what is in the effect of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, from the creation of the angels of the light is a neighbor of the majority of the majority.He created an angel of fire, angels of a frog, and an angel of this, and this is, and he wanted to be under the throne as a river if he seized in it Jabril, peace be upon him, and he will be blessed with him A country of it is a king, and I understand the words of some that it is limited to the fact that a strike from the angels does not violate the devils with the same, but it violates them with the symptoms and the rituals, as well as And heaven, they include them, and he was a Plice of this class, so he prepared what you wanted from the king of the king, and a hook, and with that, the collection will be brought between the sayings, and God knows best.Then the famous is that the discretion is connected if it is from the angels, and it is cut off if it was not from them, and you have learned that they would cost them to connect it with the saying When the grammarians, and the fundamentalists that the interrupted is the one who is excluded from his gender, and the communicator is the one who is excluded from his gender, Al -Qarafi said in the contract, and he is the one who is the one who is in the contract His saying is up to the Almighty: Do not eat your money between you with falsehood, unless you are a merchant and do not taste in it the death except the first death, and the believer was only killed It is interrupted with the fact that the one who is excluded from the sweetener of what is before it, so the guidance is overwhelmed, and the truth is that the connected is what was ruled in it on the sweetener of what you have gone on to the first It must be from these two leaders, so when one of them was chosen, then it was cut off by that it was not the same thing, whether it was judged by his etiquette, or not, or not.The interrupted is one of the two types, and the connected is one type, and the interruption is as the transmission of the communicator, for we are the richness They taste, etc.It will be a merchant because it does not eat falsehood, but rather, and so, except for a mistake because he has no divorced killing, otherwise it is permissible, so he is not permissible, so he is not.Three, judgment on the sex without the contradiction, and the judgment other than it, or otherwise, and the one who communicates is one of the one, so this is the confusion, and the ritual, Entry in judgment and its numbers, not in the truth of the memorizer and its numbers, so you hope that you will be guided.And I understand the words of the people, God Almighty, with them, is that all the creatures are upset and their sins, their happy and sophisticated, and the one who is the right of the truth.And he greeted, as he indicates to him the saying of Nablisi, he sanctified his secret, bidding what he returned to the back: And in the effects that support that, except that the high angels were created from him, peace and blessings be upon him, from the camels, and an angel from the majesty, and it is interpreted by this The demonstration of the majesty of God, the Glory be to Him and the Him, and for this that it was what was, and it was not rewarded, and he did not regret, and he did not ask for forgiveness for his knowledge that God is the Almighty His grace is the one (P-231), which is required by the truths, so there is no way to change it and its exchange, and it is noticed from that of its call by the elderly and not the name of it, but it was not.Its name is Azazel, or the plow, and its nickname is Abu Mir One of the disbelievers was the type of signal to some of what was mentioned, and the sentence was navigated as an answer to whom he said: What did he do?It was said: The first two verbs are in the position of a staple in the case, that is, the foreigners, arrogant, and he was among the disbelievers.After a sacrifice, and the abstinence with the nose and the ability to do the verb, and for this it was your saying: my father is the father of injustice, the most abundance of: the verb is not, and it is not the right, After the devotion, the emptying of God, and God refuses, except that his light is fulfilled and his saying: God refuses, except for his justice and his exaggeration ∗∗∗, so the denial is not known, nor is the one who is known With openness, and on it it does not refuse to be a measure, and my father has heard my satisfaction, so the harms are then a measure, and the verb here is deleted, that is, the prostration, and the prostration, From what came in it, I will do in the sense of the act and it was said: The arrogance is that the person himself is greater than others, and it is a slave, and if it is greater in the one, and it is more By saving, and the fathers were presented to him, and if he was delayed in the arrangement, because it is one of the backs of the phenomenon, with the disagreement of the adaptation, for it is the one who is the one, for the sake of the ritual It is that he is afraid of his condition The angels, it is appropriate for the first to start with the confirmation of what was ruled by it in the discretion or by creating the news about it with the violation, so he started with the absence of it, The meaning: It was in the knowledge of God Almighty from the disbelievers, or was the infidel people who were in the land before the creation of Adam, and it was said: in the sense of it, and it is what he said.Fawak: And the origins were reversed, and because it was the back at that time, then it was fulfilled, then his disbelief is not to leave the duty as he claimed to the fences of it.This is required in our mill on what the leaders indicated, and its affirmation before that is not destroyed by it, but with the pursuit of God, the command of God is the best of God.From it, and the best, as the fathers and the arrogance indicate, and Abu al -Aali said: The meaning of the disbelievers, from the dishes, then the phenomenon that his disbelief was from the ignorance of it From the knowledge that was resurrected by it, when the morsel was the millions, and the nails of the judiciary if they are tied to the blood, and the fate is cruel to if it is deaf.الم The argument of the connection was a flower between us ∗∗∗, and a wind was given to him from the between, and it was exhausted and said: On the authority of the stubbornness that he carried on the love of the rituals and the admiration of what is from what is from If only he would have increased his destiny, and a sky between the domain of the name, then he is good, but: ؎ If it is not a matter This story has performed eyelids, and the eyes were diluted with eyes.We were running for me, and for me, in Sawad, from the passion ∗∗∗ So when we were firmly, you have proven, and from here, Al -Shafi’i and Al -Ash'ari said, and their saying is that I say that this is the one.He who fulfills the servant to him, and he comes in despair in his last life, and the first homes of his last, and therefore it is true that I am a believer, if God wills, may God bless you Rather, in the real, and considered faithful faith at the death, and the sealing of the work, and it was true of Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him It is excluded, as the believer’s consequences are absent for them, and it is the one who is the one who is on the authority of his worshipers (P-232) and in the correctness of Jabir, it was from the one who said: The hearts have proven our hearts on your religion), “and tell” (Whoever said: I am a believer, if
