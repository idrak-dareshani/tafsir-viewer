The Quranic researcher who believe in the unseen and evaluate the prayer, and from what we have agreed, they spend a row for those who are righteous before, so if I want to be pious, the first of it is the first.The second of it is a revelation, or its third, and it is a gossip, and in the explanation of the honorable conquest: if the one who fears is carried on the part of the Sharia, the one who does the obligations, The addressee was ignorant of that sense, the description was detector, and if it was a scholar, he was praise, and if he was pregnant with what he is close to the linguistic meaning, he was special, and he was noticed A detailed, the intelligence of the news, after it, then his proof of what he accepted, and if he understands a guarantee, then it is if he did not leave it like the neighbor, and this is sufficient in the rituals, Or Bayani, as if it was said: What are the righteous are given to that guidance, and the stand on the righteous is complete on this direction, good at the first direction, and the faith, and the faith, So the wisdom of the expert and its acceptance and made it honest, and it is a verb of security, as if the truth of it believed in it, it believes that the denying and the disagreement, and the absence of the one who is in the way Hope: I believe for you and follow you, the righteous and the loyalty, as in his saying ﷺ: “(Faith is to believe in God)” The hadith, they said: And the first is the one who will be blessed, It is included in the meaning of the confession, indicating that the belief is not considered what is not passed by the confessions, and it may be called in the sense of the trustees of the one who is the one who is the one who has become A naughty fact as well as in the first place, and his reward is understood as the appearance of the words of the scouts, and on the urban, it is the belief in what is known as the one who comes to the coming of the Prophet ﷺ Differentially, in detail, and in detail, as well as a wardrobe, and this is the way to the crowds of the investigators, but they disagreed with the fact that the rulers of the rulings are the rulings of the rulings The meaning, or with the righteousness, went away and followed Al -Ash'ari until this meaning is sufficient, because it is the intended, and the ritual is, but it is to know, and it is the same The rulings, whoever believes in his heart, and left the declaration with his ability to do it, was a believer who is based on what is between him and between God Almighty, and he will be his chair (p-111).Al -Hammam is that the people of this saying agreed on that it is necessary to believe that when he was asked to decide from him, he will come to him, for if he is talked, and he did not read, then he will be.Hanifah, may God have mercy on him, and the majority of those who follow him until the righteousness and what is in its ruling as the sign of the laughter, must be of it, so the authenticity is the one who is a believer who is a believer who is faithful The other is like the worshiper with the luminous, for it is not beneficial to his prayers, and perhaps this is because it is the highest of the calibers, more than what the ignorant people, and the one who is the one who does not The defamation of linguistic denial, and no He doubted that it is the mark of denying or for the hearts of the heart that is the denying, and that is the result of preventing the validity of the believer, for it is against the denial, but it is against it It is against the convergence and ignorance, and they agreed that that definition is outside the linguistic belief, and it is the one who is considered in the faith, the blessings of which are the one who disappeared in that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in the way that it is in it Or in the consent of the first, the second science is on the first, and it is permissible for the image to be made from the fully experienced experience, and that the ritual of the righteousness is visible With the eyes of the linguistic belief, and therefore he was pleased with them in the Faris Books (Bakr Waddin), and in the Arabic of what violates the denying, and this is the same It is supported by what the master, the bond in the footnote of the explanation of the savings, will show it that it is clear that it shows what is in the knowledge and the language, except that he wants that the meaning of it (the meaning of it) A categorical matter, and the text on it has been stipulated in the limits, and therefore it is sufficient in the chapter of faith, the righteousness of the exaggeration is the limit By agreement, they divide the knowledge in the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the perception of conception and believing in which it is affiliated with it to the pilgrim to the authority of the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the reward The composed of the famous, the Muslim women, the spectacular whims of the acceptance of the acceptance, the preachers, and the composed poetry from the imaginations, so if it was not the same In general, it is not proven that these parts are proven, and it is an apparent, and the privilege of the law is on the other, for the image that takes place from the ful is a fully taught.If he has a intention, and the choice is where the obedience and the acceptance are required, then it is a linguistic belief, and if it is not like that, it is like it, so it is a good thing, so it is a good thing A parable is like a definition, and it is not a linguistic belief, so the linguistic belief has a more special from the one who is the one who is the sake of the ritual, and that the faith is gone.With the two testimonies, there is no other, and the Kharijites and the relations, and the servant of the mighty from the disgraced until every obedience is a hypothetical faith that it was or a nose, and the Juba’i, his son, and his son, Obed by the supposed obedience without the nawfil from it, and the Halnasi is from the people of the Sunnah, and the carpentry is from the disgraceful, which is the greatest of the most effective people, that the knowledge is known, and the knowledge is the same With the ancient, it was said: The secret of this conflict is the difference that the cost is the spirit that is only, or the body is only, or their group, and the truth is that the origin of all the people Silok is in it, and the doctrine clarified that it is believing, and that is why it is toured The believers are upon the generosity of God Almighty: The faith is known and the knowledge is a surrender, and the peace is a belief, and this is the same as the one who says: Their hearts of faith and its words are exalted: And when faith enters your hearts and his words, the Almighty is: and his heart is reassured by faith and his saying: He attributed it in it and in its curricula, which is not harvested to the heart, so that it indicated that it is the verb of the heart, and it is only the belief, as it was not shown in the part We say, otherwise the discourse of faith is a discourse with what is not understood, and because it is the disagreement of the origin, then it is not made to him without evidence, and it is intended to be intended by the text of the faith, so the faith is the faith The heart, not the lawful faith, may be the declaration or otherwise it is part of its meaning.May God bless him and grant him peace, without his meaning, and he said: “(To believe in God and His angels)“ The hadith, (p-112), then it is in the meaning of the word In the real divorce, and also the kindness of the work of faith on faith as the Almighty saying: “Those who believe and do righteous deeds“ and part does not overlook all of it And the spirit on one of the two districts with the interpretation of the abandonment of a rhetorical composition, and its specialization with the nawfil by building it on its exaggeration, the disagreement Faith is the condition of the validity of the validity of the work, such as its words, the Almighty: Whoever does from the righteous and is a believer with the piece that the conditions do not enter into the condition of the condition of the condition of the condition of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the condition of the condition, The condition of the condition is a condition, and also and the renality of the faith of faith for those who left some of the works, as in the saying of the Almighty: and two sects of the believers, they did not follow it.With his pouredness, and also what we mentioned is close to the original, as there is no difference between them except by administering the pessimism of the commented as it is not hidden, and the one who is the one who is the one is the one who is the one who is the same If it was a statement of believing, he would not have disappeared with the belief of the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.He gathered it with a text, but God loved you and decorated it in your hearts, and hated it to you with disbelief and the debauchery, and if it was in the sense of the belief, it is not forbidden.The biggest is what he contradicts to the Almighty saying: And the believers were merciful with his saying, the exalted in the adaptation: Do not take you with them, and it is not the right of it, The one who is the one who is the believer is not a shame for his saying: A day, God does not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him and said his rituals in Quta'a Al -Tarq The world and the one in the hereafter is a great torment, so they are not believers with the believer that they are the fifth of the fifth of the pilgrims, the pilgrimage, if it leaves it from the other than the other People are the pilgrimage of the house, whoever is able to do a way to it, and whoever disbelieves, for God is rich in the worlds with the two worlds with the truthful, the sixth who is not judged by what he is not.He did not judge what God has revealed, for those who are the fourth of them are that the adulterer, as well as the text of his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Prayer is a pillar of others, and like that, the eighth is that the one who is hidden by a prophet is a charity, with the time that he is disbelieving in consensus.Exalted: And they are commanded only to worship God, who have been glorified by the religion, and they will pray the prayer, and they will pay zakat, and that is the religion of the values ​​and religion is the Islam that is the one who says: God is Islam and Islam is the faith because it was if he was not accepted by what he wanted to say to his saying, his grace is: He who is seeking to be a debt is a debt, then he will not be a debt, then he will not be the one who is not.Certification for what was correct and the description of the cost of it is true, except for the time of it from it, as in the path of the verbs, with the fact that the sleeping and the heaving are described by the gathering of it In them, the one is twenty, that it is necessary to say to those who believe in the gods other than God, they will be believers He is glorified and exalted, and he said: He does not believe in the most of God except while they are shared, even if he was the belief that he would not be forbidden to do so, and he is the one who has been blessed.To be the belief in the tongue as the Karamiya said, how and the people of the language do not understand from believing that it is not true for the tongue?And it is answered from the first that the certification of the aspects, and if we greeted us with the extent of the increase and the decrease in it from the Prophet and the one who is from us, except that it is not the reason for the devotion to the one who is in the way The verb and power between the numbers of faith and the lack of its evacuation, or by the exhibits of similarity and skepticism, and the extent of its presentations, and the best of the best of the Most High.He greeted.الملي The gnawer and the baz of all the goodness are wings and the height of the king between what is hunted in Baz The immorality does not collect faith, for if it was said: He loved you knowledge and hated it to you (P-113) the immorality did not indicate the contradiction between the knowledge and the knowledge of the knowledge Faith has not been beneficial from the verse, but rather outside, and if we greeted the significance of the verse on what you mentioned, except that this is opposed to what It is indicated by his numbers, as his saying is the Almighty: Those who believe and did not wear their faith with injustice, for it indicates the comparison of injustice for the faith in some The action of the great is contrary to faith, and does not take you as a head in the religion of God in a sense that does not bring you the companion The one who is the one who is mentioned in the two verses is not a sign, because the verse of the semeshed is indicated by his negation in the hereafter from the believer, or the one who has the right The Almighty, and the verse of the vicinity indicates the treachery in the world, and does not have to compete with the treasury on the Day of Resurrection of faith, its competencies of faith in the world, and the one who does not The disbelief of those who left the pilgrimage from others, and (whoever disbelieves) is the words of words, or what is meant by those who did not believe in your pleasures, and its unicorn, and it is not conceived with that That the meaning of “whoever does not judge” is the verse who did not believe, or whoever does not judge something from what God has revealed, or what is meant by that teeth is in the village of the predecessor, It is said: The meaning does not weigh the adulterer and it is a believer, that is, safe from the torment of God, that is, if it is fornication, and the grace of God, let him be afraid of his torment, and he will not be safe, and he does not believe, We have decorated it, and he is a believer, or does not weigh while he is on the descriptions of the believer from the sects of the prohibitions, and this interpretation is the first of the contrary to the absence of the abundance of the abundance of it.This, and on the eighth that we do not deny the group of the cabinets of faith in the mind that it is not that the nation is collected on the atonement of the deceased, so we know that it is the one The oaks are likely to hear, and the collection between the work of the language of the language, and the nation’s consensus on the atonement is the first of the heroes of one of them, and from the ninth that the verse is between the verse.The action of the obligations of compassion, and it is an apparent manifestation of the seductive, we greeted us that religion is the act of abuse, and that religion is Islam, but we do not peace that Islam is the faith, and there is no faith.In the verse, what is the meaning of it, according to the concept, or it is necessary that the prayer and zakat should not be accepted, for example, but the one who has the same is according to the righteousness of the charity, and the time Yes, and this is as if you say: Whoever uses the other of the legal knowledge, then it is not possible, for you do not judge with the sorrow of the one who loses the words, and it is not the same, so it is not.Your saying: other than the animal, a slander that is not necessary for the human being to be reprehensible, and on the authority of the tenth that he is the one who is committed to the obligatory The condition of the sleep, and the disappearance remains in the heart and the hearts, but it is about its obtaining, and the sleep is against the realization of things, not that it is It is contrary to the meeting of the awareness of the state of the vigilance, we greeted us, except that the street made the investigator who does not discharge what is against him in the ruling of the rest, until he was the one who is the one who is the one who is in the right of Or in the past, and he did not dare to him what is the mark of denying, and on the authority of the habitual one that the name of the name of those who believe in the gods of God is not the believer, but it is a believer, but it is a believer Shari'a, his name is a believer who looks at the loudspeaker, and it is not valid for the legitimate recipient, and the second of the second is the one who is the same.They mentioned it for every point of view, and we say: Faith is there is a linguist, as in the Sharia it is considered to be believed in all of what he knows, as it is.The participant who is believed in some is only a believer in the sense of the language without the law, because of its elderly by the neutrality, and the verse is a sign of it, and it is not the same: Etc., a pretext that the proof does not help, The anger and the two virginity are called the path of the truth to the resurrection of the evidence indicating it from the necessary effects of the anger and the joy, and the rulings of faith are running on it, Rather, the conflict in his being is a believer with God Almighty, and the Prophet ﷺ, and after him, as they were judging the faith of those who spoke to the two martyrs, they are the ones who have been.It is not sufficient for faith in the verb of the tongue (P-114), which is not what is not necessary for a bush in it, as if it is that the Raqqi and Qatan were involved in it.When the first, and the confirmation that is attributed to the choice at the second, and the Karamiya said: Whoever destroys the denial and the appearance of the obedience, even if it is a believer and a slave of the sake The one who has been given faith in his visits, except that this person deserves the immortality in the fire, because of the fact that the meaning His significance, this and after the words of the sayings in this place, I did not appear to me when the righteous predecessors went to him, which is that the faith has been preserved for a place Certification, and between the work, so that it will be released on belief only, and on the group of believing and the works is true, as the one who is considered in the tree is in the tree in the tree The knowledge is the destiny between its leg and the group of its leg with the people and the rituals, so the enumeration is not called the rest of the leg, so the believer is in the way of With the homes of its branches and its branches, as long as the origin is the rest of the faith, the rest is, and it has been answered in the correctness: “ The pattern of harm is from the way), “And close to this is the saying of those who said: The works are the effects of faith that is out of faith, causing him, and it is called to the memorization of faith, and there is no sake of faith.Except that the release of the memorization has a truth over the first, a metaphor for the second, and it is a discretionary search, and the one who is repeated from faith is here, here is the belief, as it is not hidden) The status of the description, and it is absent for the exaggeration by making it as if it is, and made it in the sense of the verb that he returns, as it is in the sea, that the unseen is a source, and it is not the absence of it, Understanding, and making it an interpretation in the meaning, because the absent is absent from itself as a cost of it, or if it is reduced as a lord and a dead, and in the sacrifice, there is no one who is dead, While he was heard and scared, and he made it a collection here with what is not under the senses, and the mind of the mind does not require it, so it is not what it is not.With his pleasant knowledge, the expert, his chance, and the exalted as the knowledge of the destiny, for example, and from it what is stabbed by a sign of it, such as the right to the exalted, and the attributes of the Lord, for it is the one who knows it.On the authority of that light, then this is the people who are varying in it, and for the guardians, God bless us, may God bless them.The truth, then the servant will be given the proximity of the nawfil, so the truth will be his pursuit of his vision, which he visited with him, and he hears him who hears from him, and he hears from him So it is a light, so there is a good man, and the missions have it for us.Say: Whoever knows who in the heavens and the earth is unseen, except God, say to kill love, and you have the right to the one who is the one who is the darkness of the darkness, and it is different in the heart of the people.The Shiites were dispersed until the standing is the standing, and they were resurrected from the Hajj on that, and the one who tends to the heart is that he did not tell the Messenger of God, and the Messenger of God, the Lord of God.جِبْرِيلَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ, وهو اللَّهُ تَعالى, ومَلائِكَتُهُ, وكُتُبُهُ, ورُسُلُهُ, واليَوْمُ الآخِرُ, والقَدَرُ خَيْرُهُ وشَرُّهُ, لِأنَّ الإيمانَ المَطْلُوبَ شَرْعًا هو ذاكَ, لا سِيَّما وقَدِ انْضَمَّ To him, Al -Wasfan after him, and that is the obligation to release the absence on him.In it, his release is upon him, with his privileges, for this is not before the name of the name Knowledge is a difference between the absence and the absent, and they say: God is a good man, and there is no absence, and they mean the absentee what you do not see, and you do not see it With the abuse to enter the faith of the companions, may God bless them, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him Return to faith in his prestige, for example, as there is no meaning for faith (P-115) with its soul, none We have expressed the news and meaning, or it is from the chain of transmission of some to all of the metaphors, the son of so -and -so who killed Fassa, or what is meant is that they believe that they believe that they believe, so they believe that they will be guided.There are the viewers and others, and the choice of the father of Al -Asfahi is that what is meant is that these righteous people believe in the unseen, that is, the state of the unseen, as well Like the hypocrites who are those who are those who believed, they said: We believed in us, and if they gave them to their teeths, they said that we are with you, but we are mocked, then it is the one who said: Let him know that I did not betray him in the unseen and begged to say: the state of the absence of the believer in it, so in the Sunnah of the Darmi on the authority of Ibn Mas'oud, the one who is pleased with him is the one who is pleased with him.To him: When God is reckoned by what you have preceded us from the vision of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and you did not see him, if the command of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was among those who saw him, and who is no god but he is no one who is more That book has no doubt in which they are guided by those who are righteous to its saying: the one who is successful and does not need to be a preference of faith on another from the way of it The detail of the description of one of them is the description of the other, for the preference is different from the additions and the actions, and it may be found in the subject, and it is not in the subject, and it is not in the virtuous Masoud, may God be pleased with him, dwarfed the sacrifice of the inheritance of what he responded to ﷺ by a light, " May God be pleased with him, when he answered him, as the companions come out, may God be pleased with them, from this general, who is in this verse, as he feels it, and he feels it.And with it, some of the people of science said, and I do not tend to that, and it was said: What is meant by the unseen heart, that is, they believe in their hearts, not as they say in their mouth The first for preparation, on the second and the third for the accompanying, and on the lord of the family, and Abu Jaafar read, and Aida in the narration of the east of my father, with the authority of Bakr Every silent thumb, but it may be many of the moving, like “He does not take you” and supports his support and detailing the way of my father, Abu Jaafar, Omar, and every thickness will be left, except that it will be a mark for the severity of the like, “prepare for you” (and foretold them), and read your book, so that he does not It is also a hammer in the dwelling, and it is a fool, so every thick and subversive ghost is left if it is the fulfillment of the verb, we seek (they believe) and (do not take you) Al -Kisae and Hamza, and for every gold that is mentioned, (and they are evaluated) from residence, it is said: I resurrected something if you fulfill its right, he said: Demand and the Gospel, that is, they will fulfill their right with knowledge and work, and the meaning: they will make prayer, they adjust its legs by making it useful for it, or for the abandonment of the rituals or the excess of the rituals or the opponents of the righteousness And the Sunnah is one of the residence of the oud if it is established, or they persevere in it and keep it, if the market rose if you spend, and establish it if you make it a metaphor, or they will be tired of it, and they will not be blessed, and they will not be done, or they will not be done Tuan, from their saying: He did the matter, and established it if he found it, or they perform it and do it, and express it with residence, because the arrival is some of it, and it is the same, Speech on the first two of them is a sense of comprehension, and on the two years, it is a messenger, and that is in the first to be in the first, that the analogy of the arms is likened to the argument of the oud, so it is the valuation of the oud.He likened him to the opposite, then the residence is rented from the settlement of the bodies that have become a truth in it for the level of the suffering, as it is the same as the place In the sense of leveling is a fact in the suffering and suffering, but the evaluation in the suffering is like the debt, and the more golden (P-116) does not need to be loaned, and it is not hidden from what is in it In it is a drew and a narration, and that recovery is a famous metaphor, or a knowledgeable truth, and in the second that the market hypocrisy was the person who is in good case In it, and the residence in its spending, then it was rented from the hand, for each of them makes his attachment to a desirable, competing in it, and it is not for him, and this is not for him.On him except the properties, except that there is a savings from the metaphor, and as if it is the money of Al -Tayyibi that in this face as a talisman, where the rituals are from In the first sense, she is feelings of her form, and her waste is indicative of its vulnerability as a market if she is guided by a place that indicates the hypocrisy of its authority and its sake of its authority and its authority on its authority To them, and he calls the sustainability by its disagreement if it is not a standing, and in the third that doing the matter indicates the acquisition of the body, and it is obligatory, and it is necessary On his obligation, and it was said that he did the matter of it, it is found in it, and he came out of his reign of him with no delay or shortening For that, and he established it, that is, his lifting on his shoulders with his sentence, then it is correct that it is in it a representative or a place, or a place, or a place, or a chain It is also a messenger, because whoever rose to the feet of the feet, and raised it on the shoulders of the grandfather, then he has made his effort, and in the lord, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the prayer, And the restriction is out of it, expressing it with residence due to the relationship of the obligation, as it is necessary from the performance of the prayer and its creation all of the action of resurrection, which is the residence, because the verb of the verb is the verb of the verb, Or the partial relationship, because the residence is part or partiality for the verb of the verb, and it is permissible for a place to be informed of the performance of the performance of the residence in that Related to the prayer and to the premature of the first one, the money is a collection because it appears and is close to the truth, and I am more, and it is the narrator of the Qur’an of the Qur’an.As Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim was brought up from him from his ways of him, and perhaps that from him from a loyalty from the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, or peace be upon him, or peace be upon him, or peace be upon him.And the Almighty is the best of its pregnant women, where it is the appropriate to the perfect guidance, and the completely complete, and in which the great praise and the blind praise, and the one who is not said is that it is said that it is not said that it is not.The best face, and the last is appointed as it was said in the hadith: “(I was commanded to fight people until they testify that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God If they do so, they have been inspired by their blood and their aspirations except with the right to Islam), “It is not harmful in the first place of the first in the valuable words, as he wants to be.They pray, and the enemy is the most insignificant, without a plural that does not direct in the words of a virtue of the most vulnerable to the abolition of the words, and for every place of an article, then understanding, (and the prayer in the prayer) In the sense of supplication, and from him the saying of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: “If one of you is called to food, then it is obligatory, and if he is a fasting, then he will pray), and she is in the authority of the evil.” The lane, because it is a supplication for the three years, the case, the verb and the article, and the famous in the origins of jurisprudence that the one who is dismissed is that this and its ideals are the truth Mentable of linguistic canes, and the judge, Abu Bakr, is from us that they are a linguistic metaphor that did not support the truths, and the companions of the companions are on the authority A lukewinah, and Abu Ali said, and Al -Sahili suggested: Prayer is one of the two prayers for two parts in the afternoon, because the first of what he sees is for the sake Ibn Jinni, and the call to the prayer is a sacrifice that he likened to him in his fear of the prostration, and it was said: The prayer was taken from that because it came second for the faith With the prayers From the horses for the coming with the prayers of the previous one, and that the imam derived from the two prayers, based on the fact that the prayer is one of the most famous, so it is a longing for the sake of the I agree, and if it is said: The numbers of the vehicle are not praised in the transfer, and it was said: Whoever prayed the stick if you stand it with the prayers, so the prayer is as if it is in the way that it is in the way of it.Likewise, what is attempts to expose the wood by its exposure to the fire, and it is a verb (P-117) by opening the eye, on the famous, and it is permissible for them to be silent.Minting from the mother, and the crusters have agreed on the drawing of the waw, the place of the thousand in a complaint, a survivor, a manner, a prayer, a zakat, a life, where there is a muddam With the blame, and on the drawing of the addition of my prayers, and I was deleted from some of the Holy Quran And the book of Wow is the sign of its origin, which is the one who is transmitted by it, and it is a follower of the fool, and this is the meaning of the son of the son of Qatibah: some of the Arabs, And I did not choose to know about it for the bond of its fall in the great Qur’an, and the words of the righteous, and what is meant by the prayer is the present prayer, which is the prayers of the Fifth And Al -Nawafal, as the gathering said, and the first is the narrator on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them Ali, peace be upon him, when the Arabs showed the description of the prayer, he said: “(And God is not more over it, nor does I decrease from it, so the prayer and peace be upon him: (And the livelihood) by opening a language of giving because the animal is intended for it, and it was said: It is not like it as the tanning, and the fraction is a name of it, and the source of the one is the one who said: The luck, and it is used in the sense of the angels that benefit from it, and in the sense of the king, and in the sense of thank you when more The Ash'ari is what God Almighty has given to the animal, so he used to benefit from it, whether it was permissible or forbidden, from the holidays, or the evils, or the afflictions, or otherwise, and it is not that, and it is not.God Almighty is to be hidden to feed him, and he is obligated to the first to be a liveli According to the knowledge, as it is not hidden, and it is also necessary to eat a person who is gorgeous, because it is permissible for him to benefit from the other, for the other one, but the one who is in the abundance, but it is the one who will eat, The integrity will be on the authority of spending other than the second disagreement, as what is nourished with it is not possible to spend it except that it is said: the launch of the livelihood on the one To be his echo, and the disgraced, and they pleased him in the famous, as he gave him what God Almighty gave His servant and enabled him to dispense with him, and what he gave him to what he gave to him And its survival is special, and where the addition to God is an adequate in its meaning, and that there is no reward except God, the Glory be to Him Glory be to them, with them, he will not be a heel, nor his commitment, causing defamation and punishment.The Qur’an, and we have all of it and with it, and it, say all of God, and there is no power, and no power except with God, and to God, the affairs, the punishment, and the punishment are made, Literature is blessed from the best of the believer's money, so it is not possible to attribute to him his grace except the best, so the best is as he said, and he said: You have been blessed with them, other than the angry against them, so the forbidden is a livelihood at the same matter Ibn Majah, and Abu Naam, was removed from the hadith of Safwan ibn Umayya.So I did not give me a blessing except for my sufficiency, so I am in the richness of the richness of obscene, and he said ﷺ: No, then you are for you, nor dignity, and no grace, the liars of God, that is, The exalted, good, good and good, so you have forbidden what God has forbidden to you from his livelihood, the place of what God has permitted for you from his hala May the prayers and peace (you break it), etc., as it is a livelihood for those who are permissible for him, so the recipient will fall to the resurrection of the imam He praised the strategy that does not remain on the face of the earth, and it is stabbed in the bond that is not accepted from other than the benefits, and it is the rest of the richness, as it is not hidden, and the one who is the one He did the good and other than that, if the forbidden was not a livelihood, it was not the nutritional (P-118) has a long life, and it is not like that The earth is nothing but God, it is not something, because the one who is disgraced is not to be given the provision of food, but they should be satisfied with the divorce of the intended It is possible for it, so the indicators do not fulfill unless it is imposed that that person did not benefit from the time of his death to the time of his death with something that is not a decent From permissible water, no view of love, nor a ritual to the one who is required, but it is not possible from that origin, and the habit is the distance She realizes her that if he was destined and he said: That is not forbidden by the proportions to him, and whoever is forced to be unprecedented, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, to the lineage, and the one who are obliged, are not forbidden, and whoever is not, and no, no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, and no, and no, and no, and no, and no, and no, and no, then he does not.He who lived a day, for example, then died before he was permissible or forbidden, and what our answer is for them, their answer is for us, on the one that the verse did not indicate that it is not possible Everyone to him, for the fact that it is different, but it indicates that it was groaning and the exalted is the livelihood, and it enables it to benefit from it, so if the arms are made to the ritual It is permissible in the achievement of the Razaki, and it may also be said: the meaning of the verse is what is described by the mechanism, so do not enter the material of the abundance, so that the subject of the denial is entered.The thickness does not enter in their saying: every bear is slaughtered with the knife, that is, every bear is described by the vibrant, so it is desirable that this does not reconcile, and it is not.The reciprocate of consensus before the appearance of the disgraced, on the one that the one who eats the dignity of his life is a long -lived age, the longevity of that of that is the forbidden, and the shadows of the ritual Good and fascinating, and it is sufficient in the same way as this question, and the origin that was built by the specialization that the people of the Sunnah have been left by the bottom of the year (and the one who said: The thing woke up, and I ran out with the meaning, the prodigy of the prepared, and the origin of the material is indicative of al -Kharj and al -Dahhab, and it is a success, and the rivalry, and the righteousness, The work is to take care of what God has permitted the servant, or because he is submitted to spending in the outside, and for the appropriateness of the communities, and what is meant by the provision is that there is no permissible He also praised the spending of the forbidden, it was said: The sayings of jurisprudence are not mentioned if he collects with one of the money that his owner does not know, he will be believed by him Like him, this spending is what is rewarded for it, because what he did with the permission With the guarantee of his king, and the sanctity was changed to the same, on the authority of the dispute, if he did the good of the goodness of the one who said, as he said, as he said.Al -Fawid, then the son of Aqil went to that there is no reward for the harsh in it, because he is a sinner and the Lord of the money, because there is no intention for him, nor the reward of it, With the destiny of his money, and it was said: It is a benefit that he got with his mind, and he was born from him, and the same is rewarded for him, like the righteous child, he is postponed with him, and if he does not mean, he does not mean, and he does not mean to him From the westernity, it is also that the usurper is also done if it is done well, and if it is prepared and made from his good deeds by taking it because it is if it is a matter The sniff, and once on immorality, then if he does it Fares, he will be rewarded for it, so whoever does the weight of an atom is good, he sees and whoever does the weight of an atom is evil, and he does not want it to say, (God does not accept a charity from a ritual), and his saying: “God is good and only accepts good.” The scourge in what is obedience to itself, not on the same charity, for example, with the forbidden money from where it is forbidden, and the difference is a precaution that is not affected only by.And he was disagreed with spending here, and he was said, which is the first: the money in the ways of goodness, or the vulgarity of the phenomenon and the inner blessings, and the knowledge that is not said, as a cousin that is not from it, Zakat, and on the authority of Ibn Masoud, the agreed upon, and on the sacrifice of the vigilance before the custody of Zakat or the agreement in jihad, and perhaps this is the one who is the one who is the same.The dispute in it, and some of them made it differently, and it was likely to be the zakat that is present with its consequences (P-119) with its sister, the prayer in the number of the positions of the Qur’an, Then what is not asked about its secret, as the vocalist zakat does not be in all money, and if it is intended to spend, it is absolutely released, for example, then the reference is that the reference is to be the same Some money is sufficient in the equity of spending with guidance and salt, and does not stop at spending all the money, and the saying of our good -to -one is for the time of the time The one who is devoted to it is a specialist in whom he did not patience on the purpose, and the guidance of the addition is removed, otherwise the friend believed, may God be pleased with him, and he is the same May God’s prayers and peace be upon him for his knowledge of his patience and his knowledge of what he decided in his chest, and from here, what was said to the goodness in the son of Saraf: The good, and it was said: The joke is in an introduction from the membership is that the sustenance is better than the permissible and the forbidden, so it was entered by marking that the spending that is accustomed to it is what is from the ritual, and it is from the one who is In the verse, either a connection, a source, or a supporter, and the first is first, the virtue is deleted, and it is formed that if it is destined to connect to the necessity The arrangement, and the separation in its example is obligatory, and if it is estimated, it is forbidden to delete it, as they have answered the remembrance of the separated, and it is not the same.He was omitted, and the connotation came to him, and he answered the choice of all, but the first is that when the two guerrillas differed in collection and individuals, their connection is permissible, and if it is like it, and if it is like it ؎ To your face in charity, simplified and cheerful ∗∗∗ I have a stand of honor and the father and also that it is obligatory from preventing that in it, in which it is forbidden, and it is permissible.The second is that Who is forbidden to be deleted, what was separated by a metaphor, such as the confusion, not divorced, as the son of Hisham said in the small gathering, and he referred to him, and he is one of the ones, and he is one of the) (With) the deletion of the noun, because the neighbor and the mourning were one thing, and the noun was omitted, so it was deleted in the line, he said it in the sea, and he made it.A verbal verb, and he did not make the connector, and he will reach it in the name of the active, because the harms, while the one mentioned it, is a feeling of renewed and the limitations, with what is in it.The renewal, and this is the most renewed in the righteous, and the name of the subjects at them is not like that, and this grammar is arranged from the ritual, because it is the one that is the same The inclusion of the truth of the neutrality and the prophecy, and the restoration, as if it were the works as the sacking of a sign that the shadow calculated in water, or a template and the origin of the prayer, because the prayer is that the prayer is between the prayer The disbelief and Islam, which is the baptism of religion and the nakedness of the units, and the mother from which the calm of the good and the premises, and this is why God Almighty said: In prayer), “God has given up faith, as a group of the infidels said in his saying:“ And God would not have lost your faith, or the money, and it is a money The knowledge of the steadfastness was found on faith, and this three are the varying arrangement, so his pursues arose and the exalted, and that is provided for the most important, the most important, the obligatory, the obligatory The cost is all, and the prayer is in the most leaps, and the agreement in some cases, so understand that, and God takes care of your guidance.
