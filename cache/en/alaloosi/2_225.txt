The researcher of the Qur’an, God takes you to the language of your hearts, who are not accustomed to the words and others, and the rhetoric of the right when the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - may God be pleased with him The tongue, and what is in its ruling from what was not intended from the right; As the saying of the Arabs: No, God, not by God, for the deception of affirmation, and he is the narrator of Aisha and Ibn Omar and others in the most narratives, and the meaning: No, not to take you.It is from the days.But I take you with what your hearts have earned, that is: what you have intended from the days and those who are your hearts have come to you God, with the language of your faith, but I take you with what you have held the days, so his atonement is to feed the ten holders, etc.Because it is the one who was earning the heart, and that requires its numbers; Because the prostitution is in it the disagreement of the contract, and it is what is solved in it in the future to be done, and it is not done for its struggle in the intercourse of his saying: Iman, then the thumbs are in the past, and it is the solution on a past that is deliberate in which the lies are in it, and its linguistics is because the righteousness is achieved in which he is the one who is the one who is a good thing.Because Al -Shafi’i carried what you complicated on the earnings of the heart of those who held on it like this I had determined to it, and it was not reflected; Because the contract is beautiful, it carries the neck of the heart, and the bond of the thing is began with the distress, and the gain is an informative, and from the barriers, it is the same Including the dip, and the linguist (P-128) was not intended in it, not the dispute of the contract; For (no) is a contract, so the verse is unified in the adoption of the dignity and the inclusion of the adoption of linguist Relativity in which there is no intention in it with the penalty and the disbelief, and the proof of the argument in the sentence with them, or by one of them in it in it a intention, and if it is not for it, it is not for it.Extremely in this verse on the disbelief in the disbelief in the verse of the extended, based on the union of juvenile and judgment and the point of the verse for the sake of the disbelief And the uncle was supported by what Ibn Jarir came out from Al -Hasan, “He - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -“ passed by a people who communicate with him, and with him, and with him.And he said: I have shouted and God, I sinned, and God, who is with him, said: The man is the man, O Messenger of God, and he said: “Whatever the archers of the archers, there is no disbelief in it,” Hanifa that the language is here what is not intended in it to the lie that there is no intention or the suspicion It is the last, and that the divorced woman is spent to the whole and has been porn in this.As there is no lesson for intending and its numbers in the mountains of the atonement that are unjust, there is no doubt that it is the jurisprudence of the right, with the end of the murmur, not The other in the contract, so it is not possible to conduct what it has gained on its general, so it is imperative to be specialized in the thorns, so it is obtained from this verse in the absence The dignity is without the worldly world, which is the disagreement of the Shafi’i and the number of the other disagreement, in what is in what is in which it is intended to be the one who thinks the righteousness Originally - in which Al -Shafi’i Al -Shafi’i - and the holding of the reward in the verse of the building on the world in the village of the two villages of his saying, in which he said: His atonement is the one who said: You held the contract; Because the one who is repeated from (the contract) is the confidence of the thing with the thing, and it is an apparent in (the contract), so what is meant (by linguistics) in that verse is what it exceeded from the dignity, and it is from it.The unprepared of the minimum (atonement) on the other hand, and it is the dignity and the disagreement against it in the hereafter - as it is known from the verse The honesty of others thought that they are in the other as well as it was known from it, and the worldly delay is on the contract that was not known to the one who knows the rule For the appearance of the arrangement of the worldly arrangement, then there is no drain between the two verses with it also - because the first one is fulfilled in the first place The diploma, and the second is the second of the world's delay in it, and from this it is known that what is in (the guidance) and was popular in the books of the companions from the imam; Where he said: Eyman is on three of three.The impermissibility of the diploma, the oath of the sophisticated, and the oath of the ruling, and the evidence of the rule of each, and the best of the brother is that he was solved in a past while he thought - as he said - and he said - and he said - and he said - The narrations on the authority of Abu Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - and otherwise - is not something - even if the intended was in the interpretation (the exclusivity), not to be the same.Because the righteous with the system is that it is (what has been caused) is an interview with the absence of the middle of them between them, and by the intention of (the exclusivity), the right of the one who is not the one who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not mean it The knowledge of the name or the drawing, which is hardly that it is not hidden from the description, so it is managed, for it is what is missing from many people.And Mossouq went until (linguist) is the solution on the ticks and its righteousness, it is left that act and no disbelief.It was narrated from Ibn Abbas and a peacock: that the right is in the event of anger, so there is no disbelief in it.And Ibn Abi Hatim was brought out of Ibn Abbas, he said: The right of the right is to prohibit what God has permitted - the Almighty - to you to say: Male is forbidden if you do so, if you do so Except in the wife - and the son of Jarir was brought out from Zayd ibn Aslam, he said: He is like the man of the man: May God blind my eyes if I do not do so, and his saying: He is a polytheist, he is a disbeliever if he does not do so, so he does not take him until he is from his heart, and he said: Al -Mukhara - Ibn al -Faris narrated it, and it was not seen as a chain of transmission - this is not overwhelmed by the saying of the Almighty: (P -129) The verse does not take you on what he accepted to the disagreement of it, and if it was tied up, if it was tied up, and if it was the one who was tied up, and if it was the one who came to it.Jericho in the universe of each of them is a biar for the ruling of the days.And God is forgiven, where he did not take you with a sweet language, 225, where he did not make the disadvantage on the right of the grandfather; And the sentence is an elaboration of the two precedents, and its affiliation with the believers and the inclusion of charity for them, (and the righteous) from (the dream of the day) Punishment, and the origin of the (dream) of the patience, and the dream of the ancient, the fraction is dreaming of the conquest if it is spoiled, and as for the dream of any seen in his sleep - then the conquest - And the source of the second (dream) with the opening of the lam and the third export (the dream) by adding the H with the annexation and silence of the lam.
