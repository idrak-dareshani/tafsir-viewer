The Quranic researcher, the children of the children of the matter of the Messenger - may God bless him and grant him peace - as it is the original in the speech or for every one who is correct from the question, and the question is that the question is, and the question is that And their gestures on their tyrants and their oppression after the clear verses, not to answer, and he knows their answer, as if one of us wanted to say: He asked him how much I have been blessed with it, and the verse was attached to what was before it on what was said that the destiny is in (do they look at) if the people of the book have it Bayan for the state of the people who are from the people of the book after the state of the hypocrites from the people of the evil, how many of them came from a clear verse, that is: a phenomenon, which is the righteous, which is the one The Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - as the good and the Mujahid said, and specialize in the miracles of the miracles of the people of the book with its general to all; Because they know other than them with miracles and how they are of truth; Perhaps their knowledge of the miracles of the precedent prophets, and it may be intended with the verses with the comprehensive, and it is a group of the Qur’an and others, and it is clear that the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the meaning The joining of the Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - may God bless him and grant him peace - and investigate his prophethood and believing in what he came with.And (how) is either experienced and responsible for it is deleted, and the sentence is a strain that is not a solution from the Arabs based on their investigation, as if it is the one who said: About their tyrants and their halls for the truth after its clarity, so we have given them many clear verses, and he claimed that the sentence of the sentence is on the authority of this Establishment, and the sentence in the position of the second verb for the sake of Sel and it was said: in the position of the source; That is: they asked this question, and it was said: in the position of the case; That is, he asked them, saying: How many of them came, and the questioning of the report in the sense of the holding of the addressee on the acknowledgment, and it was said: in the sense of verification and the confirmation, and the one who is more Recalling, and it does not collect investigation, and it is answered that the brilliance is on their oppression, the right and its unanimous denial of the coming of the verses, not to come to the coming of it.The monument is that it is a second effective for our coming and not from the preoccupation as it was concerned, or raising the abuse of the virtue of the valleys, and the appreciation: Weak at his Sibu, and a distinction, and from a link that he brought to the separation between the whereabouts of an effective verse for (we came) and what is it in the case Like this position, Al -Ridi said: And if the chapter is among the expertise and its distinction with a prepared act, then it is necessary to come with someone; Like the distinction is not the same as that of that transgressor, we are left, how much they left from gardens, and how much our family of villages and condition (how) The boundary is the way it distinguishes it with the chapter as the case (how) the experience in all of what we mentioned is ended, and it was narrated from it that he denounced the increase of (from) from the It is forbidden for the increase without a chapter, not divorced, so do not contradict his words, and whoever replaces the grace of God, that is, his verses, for it is the reason for the guidance, and it is the one The appearance is the position of the host, without the prime disclosure of the pronouncement of the verses, and its extermination of its deprivation and its loyalty, or making it to be lost, or made it for the sake (P-100) Al-Rajas, and on the two estimates, there is no deletion in the verse, and Abu Hayyan said: The letter of the run is deleted from (Na’a) and the second verb is to replace and replace: God is disbelieving, and it is evidenced by the formation of the condition of the condition for it, in which there is no hide, and read: (And whoever replaces) with lightness, after what he came from: Its knowledge, and the extension of this increase, and if the verses are in absolutely divorced, the expulsion is that they spoiled it after what they have said, and it is a good On their inception of their condition, and remedy themselves with severe torment; Where they changed after the knowledge, and this is the payment of what is caused by the fact that the trial is only after the coming, so what is good in its remembrance, then the one is the one who is the one.The reference has the evaluation of his position, and the ability: and whoever replaces the grace of God, is the most severe of the punishment; Because it is the hardship of punishment, and it is enticed to be the answer to the ability of the guerrilla; That is, the hardship of the punishment for it, and the emergence of the generous name of the darkening and the inventory of the brightness.
