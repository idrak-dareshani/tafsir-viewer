the time.And the son of Jarir was brought out on the authority of Ali, who honored God Almighty that he said in the goods of what you have gained: from gold and silver, and in his saying: And what is the one who is late for you And the dates and everything on it is a zakat, and the sentence is for what is spent from what is spent on the basis of the origin of the spending and its in its way It is independent, or for sure, and perhaps the first, and leave the remembrance of the goods to perhaps what is before it, and it was said: Perhaps his knowledge from what is after).And do not complete any

remind its descriptions from it For Al -Khabith, which is attached to (spending) and adherence to discharge, and the total is an estimated state of the actor you do, that is, do not intend to intend the heights, or the one who is bound by That is, the spending is concluded, and whatever he does not want to have to be forbidden from the shoes, then he only said that the creature is also the same because of the sake To show them what they were crowded with spending in particular.So he said: “I asked me, the generosity of God, the Almighty, and his face from this verse, and he said: I came down in the zakat that is the one who was the man, and the man was the man.So he is isolated by the good, so if the owner of the charity comes, he gave it from the new one, so God Almighty said: Do not

with that because the warden is in it more, and that it is more And its calamities, and you spend a state of the removed actors, that is, and do not intend the cabinet as a place of money or from what we have exacerbated for you.And the Almighty said: You will take him in every case of a guarantee that you will spend, that is, and the situation is that you are not taking it at the time of the halls of the ham You are in your affliction or only by being in it in it and the clouds, such as the functioning of the eyelids, because of what is exposed to the sleep, and I have been used here as the rich said to the forgiveness, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is shown, On the authority of that and not devoid of leniency and healing, and the father mentioned that he uses a transgressive and is the most and is the most likely, like this, and the verse is an imprisonment, And on the first: the active will be deleted, that is, your eyes, and the gathering on the

did not preserve, and the best of you It is estimated in the position of the run, as we refer to it, and the father of the survival was permissible to be in the position of the position on the current one, and his premium is not permissible for it to be permissible.The convergence is that () is a conditional because it is with it if you are overwhelmed by you, and it is not possible that the approach of the acceptance is closed to it, and from the distant in the verse: Excellency: Do not complete the cabinet, then insist on the way to the way of the meek and the distress: from it you spend, and the situation is that you do not take it, but you will not take it.The denial understanding, as if it was said: his security is spent, etc., and he is after him the difference of the influential interpretations of the righteous predecessor, may God be pleased with them.“ Al -Khabith and Emnah that this is one of the effects of ignorance in his affairs from his Ximid [267], meaning that he deserves to be praise for his blessing, and from the sentence The spending of good is what was blessed with it, and it was said: Hamid with the acceptance of good and rewarding him.And it was
