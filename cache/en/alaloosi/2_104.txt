The Quranic researcher, those who believe, do not say our shepherd, the preservation of others.On the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, that the Jews were saying that is a secret to the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him His companions, peace and blessings be upon him, say: They declare with it, and they would say that, and they laugh at them between them, so God Almighty revealed this, and this is the goodness of this May God be pleased with him, who heard it from them, and he said: O God's elderly He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “You have been saying it, so the verse was revealed, and the believers ended a dam for the door, and cut off the people, Ubayd, Ibn Jarir, and Al -Nahhas were brought out from a gift, he said: Our shepherd was the language of the supporters in the ignorance.(P-349) And Jews used it in line with it, so they would be about it, and as for the pretext that it is a language specialized in them, it is not an apparent because it is an entrepreneur in the language of the language, And the meaning of this word is when God cursed them, the Almighty, hear, not heard, and it was said: They wanted to be attributed to him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and God bless him, Raoun, which is ignorant, and foolish, and if they wanted to be foolish, they said: Our shepherd, that is, oh fools, then the thousand is then for the extension of the voice, and the ritual of the call is the one who is a deleted In the first place, Zaid, Zaida, with a thousand to be the call between two sounds, then I should be satisfied with me and the thousands intended, and it is necessary that they wanted the source, that is, the source, that is, Our shepherd, and the abuse of the collaborators on the authority of standing, and the good and the son of my son of Lee, Abu Hayyah, and the son of Muhasin with the collaborators, made it, and made it a ritual A deleted, that is, a saying: our shepherd, and the form of an actor at that time for the proportions of a son and a mirage, and the saying was described by him for the sake, as it is said: And Abi (our sponsor) at the chain of transmission of the gathering of the gathering, to the enemy, as the Farisi demonstrated it, and it was mentioned that in the Mu’inf al -Abdullah (and the sake of God) That the prohibition is that the reaction is required, it requires the consent in the majority.He greeted, and his distance is not hidden from the reason for the coming of the stages, and they said that we look at us, that is, we are waiting for us, and that we are on us, or look at us to be the most powerful and the most powerful The verb is to the verb, but it is expanded in it, and it is transgressing himself at the same time: The vision, and what is meant by the thinking and the displacement is that the state of the perspective is correct in its matter, and the meaning: you think about our matter and the best of the affairs with me, but it is not the same We look at the eye in the abandonment of the manner of the situation so that this word is based on the first place After the one who is the most difficult to obtain the people before the prohibition, and read Abi and the people (to look) by cutting the gossip and broken the shadow, and the shadow of the shadow, and the shadow of the shadow, We receive from you and keep what we hear from you, and this reader witnesses the first meaning on the readers ’readings, except that it is on the authority With it, and I have forbidden you from it so that you do not return to what I have forbidden from it, and do not leave what I commanded you with, or is it a matter of goodness of the goodness, and that it will be the same The migrants do not need a pleasant request, so he alerted him to shortening in the hearing until they committed what caused the caution, So it will be a briefing to Jews, where they said: He heard and disobeyed us, and if the meant is heard this matter, and the forbidden, it will be sure of what was presented.The disbelievers have a torment of the pain of the era, so what is meant by the disbelievers who have said what they said, they are hidden in the Messenger ﷺ known as what is before the predecessor, The appearance is the position of the host, marking that the humiliation of the Messenger of God ﷺ is a disbelief that requires the passion of torment, and in it is the affirmation As Abu Hayyan chose it, he is not a backwardness on what was said, because the words are with the believers, so this is not valid to be a distortion.
