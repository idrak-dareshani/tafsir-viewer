The researcher, the Quran, a day, do not reward a soul from the same day, the time and its injury is either on the custody, and the one who is deleted is deleted, that is, and fear the torment, and the day of the day.In the sense of the convergence of what is in it, either it is metaphor by making the custodian a phrase for the Mu'tarouf, or as a way for it to his obligation for him, for the purpose of the soul of the day is not for what is not.A referral, and the people of paradise and the fire must see all of the people, and the possible place is the one in it with good deeds, (and it is rewarded) from the meaning of the judge, which is the same For his first act, and from the second, and the home of the obligatory is revealed to the language, and the meaning: Do not spend the day of the soul of the soul of the soul, and there is no soul.On the authority of it, and do not take care of what it happened, or you do not spend anything from the penalty, then it (something) is either on that it is an act of it, or that it is a matter Permanently, and the father of Al -Simak (and does not divide) read the most rewarding of it if it is richer, then it is necessary, (and something) is a divorced, not otherwise, and the meaning: Do not enrich the none of the people.It finds it with goodness, and denying the names of the blindness in the lipstick and the coded, and what is in the rushing, and in it from the evolution, and the ears with the obedience of the obedience to what is not hidden, as it is not hidden.Hope: One day the woman escapes from his brother, his mother, his father, and his companions, and his sons for every one of them is a day that he sings and the sentence in the man A deleted, that is, you do not reward it, and the Kisi is not permitted to delete the pilgrims if he does not know, so do not say: I saw a man who desires, and you want it, and you want: In this trend, which is to delete the navigator first, until the annexes communicate with the verb, and he will become an advice, and he will be watered as he said as he said: The cultivation and length of the era or money that they want to want to be afflicted, and it may be permissible on my opinion of the Kufic that the sentence will not be a row, but it is added to it (the day) of the one who is omitted.Do not need a guarantee, and that deleted is the same as the masculine, and from that what the Kasayi narrated it: they fed us with a heavens, a sheep, slaughtered, with a slander, with a slander, with a slander, with a slander, The flesh of a sheep, and the frequency narrated the same as that, and from it his saying: God has mercy on the greatest of its burials ∗∗∗ with two arguments, the pleasure of the sacrifices in the narrators, And the visionary does not allow the addition of the added, and the added to it is left to its reduction, and they say with the abnormalities of what he responded, and the father of Sarar reads (and it is not rewarded) In the sense of breath.It is not accepted from an intercession, nor is it taken from the rush as it is in the sea.He asks for an intercession after being an individual, and justice The ransom, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said, and it was also narrated from him, that is, a man where a man is a man, and the origin of justice is the opening of the eye, It was not from his genius, and by breaking its equal in the gender and generosity, and from the Arabs who breaks the eye from the meaning of the ransom, and the one mentioned that the one is the same Like him, and he sought the words of the son of the son of Malik: We are patience, we do not see God just ∗∗∗ On what we are tucked, and we said: The justice is the sponsor, the sponsor, and the bribe, And the second of the two pilgrims with either a back to the soul (P-252), because it is the closest of a male, and its agrees are for his saying: nor are they from His saying: It is not taken from a justice and the meaning of the acceptance of the rush at that time, if it comes with an intercession of an intercession, it is not accepted from it, or to the first because it is the one that is the one who is the one who is the first It is a virtue, and because the one who is replaced by the negative acceptance of the reaction is that if it had interceded, it would not accept its reaction, and then, the meaning of the one who took the justice is that it is the first of the first From the second, it was not taken, and as if in this verse on this is a type of sophistication, he committed it here, and if it was not committed in another denomination, as if it was said: The first is the first Her owner is used from spending the obligations, and your condemnation, because she is busy with her with her affairs, then if you are able to negate, it was not a ritual, and it is not a ritual, and it is not a ritual of it, and it is more The sacrifice was included, so it is not taken from it, and if you tried the salvation with the sacrifice and the dominance, and that I have it, so it is not possible from it, and the choice of the Kawashi made the first of the first The second for the thousand and the publication, because of the conduct of the two sentences on the meaning of them, and the dismantling matter of dismantling, and the son of the one who is notified, and the son of the son of Katr).With the meeting, and the sofy (kissed) with the opening of the ya and the stabbing of an effect on the construction of the reaction, and in which the tattoos are from the guarantee of the speaking in (my blessing), etc.For the verb is the most beautiful.And they do not support victory in the original origin, and there is a murmur that is extended with rain, and what is meant by it is what is with the payment of the harm, that is, and they are not.And the guarantee is returned either to what the second breath of denunciations extensive With other words, either to the denial of the soul from where it is for its generalization in the denomination in the sense of many, as it was said in the saying of it: It is mentioned to the interpretation of the phosphors of worship and the people, and in which it is alerted that these souls are slaves, who are humiliated, and they are humiliated, People in this The matter, and its return to the two souls, based on the fact that the gathering is a whole, and it is made of negation, with a blessing of a nomadic sentence, And the sentence after his news, and made it a verb when it was not numbered, and the verb after it is an interpreter, so the arrival of the sentence is not agreed upon the sister The deadline, and the disgraceful of the verse is committed to the negation of the reaction to the people of the cabinet, and the time of the discourse of the atone From the memorization, and it is answered by specialization from two faces, the first is according to the place and the time, because the positions of the resurrection and the amount of its time in it are in the capacity and long, and the case is in the case, and the case is in the case.And I tightened it, then he is authorized by the rush, and it was said like that in the gathering between his saying, the Almighty: there is no lineage between them on the day, and he does not say: On some of the people who wonder and the place of the deportation, it is not a Muslim, and the second is according to the people, as they must be drawn from the specialty, without the disobedience, for the sake It remains on his generality with them, otherwise the denial of the increase in the benefits is required, and they do not say about it, and we are devoted to the disobedience with the hadiths of the righteous, The chapter of specialization is opened, we also say: That negation is specialized as before the authorization of its saying, the Almighty: The rush does not benefit from it, and it is not for the ears of it, And their specialization does not show a sign for him, that the rush is to increase the benefits, almost not a reaction, otherwise we are the lip of the Messenger ﷺ when the prayer is upon him From us, and among them is that he is the lips, and also in his words of exalted: and ask forgiveness for your guilt and the believers what indicates the reckoning that we claim, and the search for the sake To him, may God grant us the exalted and grateful for the Sunnah of the Sunnah and the group.
