Because the repentance and the custody are equal in the ruling of the text, and the will of God is exalted is the original cause, so the adherence to some of them is the one who is intended for the first proud, and the second of the second Building on the fact that whoever does, etc.A division for the beautiful complexes; Because the phenomenon is his saying, “He who does, and whoever does” by repeating the condition of the condition requires the abuse between the two workers and he said: It is estimated, leaving its appearance and knowledge of it from other verses.The estimation: Whoever does the weight of an atom is good, he sees if it is not lukewarm.And whoever does the weight of an atom is evil, he sees it if he does not atone.And among them who made the vision is the best of what is in the world and what is in the hereafter.The world and the part of its evil in the hereafter, and the believer sees the part of its evil in the world and the reward of its best in the last; Al -Baghi, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Al -Mundhir narrated and others from Muhammad ibn Kaab al -Qarashi that he said: Whoever does the weight of a heavy one is a good one who is a good one who is a good The world is in itself, its people, and its money until the hereafter is attained, and it is not better for him, and whoever does the weight of an atom of evil, and he is a believer in that in the same And his family and his money until the hereafter is attained, and there is evil in it.Al -Tabrani was brought out in the middle and Al -Bayaki in the people and the son of Abi Hatim and a group of Anas who said: “Since the father of the righteousness of the friend, may God be pleased with him, may God bless him.Ali and peace be upon him, when he is the one who does the atom of the verse.May the prayers and peace be upon him: “O Abu Bakr, you see what you see in the world of what you are attentive, and with the sake of the virginity of evil, and the sake of the virginity of the good is destroyed for you.” And in the narration of Ibn Mardwi on the authority of Abu Ayoub that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said to him when he raised his hands: The world is captains and diseases, and whoever has the weight of an atom of the best of paradise.And among them is those who said: What is meant is a vision of what is equivalent to that of good and evil, the view of itself from others that the penalty is considered with him, and no one will be seen, but he will be delegated to all of them.The skilled with the pardon of the listening of the believer who is lying about the cabaret and its affliction with all its good deeds and the descendants of the good and the punishment of the disbelief Ibn Jarir and Ibn al-Mundhir and al-Bayahqi were removed from Ibn Abbas from his saying in the verse: there is no believer nor the disbeliever of the work of good and good in (P-21) Eh;
