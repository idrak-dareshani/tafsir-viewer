The Quranic researcher said: He did not give birth, etc.On the part of what preceded it.And that denied that, because the birth requires the separation of a material from it.This requires the inconvenience of the Samid and the one, or because the child is from the sweetese of his father and does not hold him to anyone; Because it is a meant and other than it is possible; Because the child is what was said to be asked by the sane person, either because of his help or to succeed him after him, and he is always a constant remaining, there is no need for something that is in the past, It is said: He will not give birth to his roses in response to those who said: The angels are the daughters of God, Glory be to Him; Or the Christ of God, may God Almighty, on the authority of this, may be a great high It will be the form of the past and the exile of the Mawlidiyyah from it by its sacrifice, so that it is necessary for it to be the subject, so it is necessary for the incompatible composition to the absolute and the one who is the one who is the one, or the one who is the one, or the one who is the one, or the one who is the one, or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the divorced and the one who is the one who is the one who is the divorced, and the one who is the one, or the one.The enemy preceded it, even if it is the same as the embodiment of the embrace of the obligatory, and the exile of the birth was presented because it is the most important; Because a group of infidels, they are delusional with the disagreement of the negation of the state or for a lot of understanding, the first disagreement of the first, without the second of the second, based on that The union is the saying of the birth and the loyalty of those who believe it with God; And that is what they have written, they say that they say: The father is the first hypnosis of the pollution, and the son is the second one who is emerging from him, the eternity of the eternity, and the soul of the The Jerusalem is the third one of them, as well, and the divine nature is one and it is for each of the three, and each of them is unified with it and with that they are three of the three, not the jihad, not The father is not the son, and the son is not the father, and the spirit of Jerusalem is not the father or the Son, and they are not the spirit of Jerusalem and with those who are one God; As one of them has one, one, one and one, and one of them, and each of them is defined with the gods, and if it is between them, it is permissible, and the first is the obligation of the duty of the one who is Al -Jawhari is said to him, and the third is the administration of the phenomenon, and it is said that love is, for God is three hypocritical hypocrites; It is a realistic, and they may give it a fact and may be called additional; That is, with the addition of some of it to some of the one who is a single man, and it is God, and there is no other in it, but all that is within it is in it in its eyes, and they say: Four additions; First: the effectiveness of the disability in the first hypostasis, its second: the act of reasoning in the second hypostasis (P-276), which is the image of the mind of the father, third: The emergence in the first and second hypostasis to which the will, its elevation: is an effective The third hypostasis that is the love of the divine will that the first and second hypnotics, and claimed that the transitional and effective in the acts of the divine and the most effective The expansion, and the effectiveness in the father is not the one who is the son of the son except for the father and in it and in the Son we are the one who is the spirit The Son and the Spirit of Jerusalem except the structures in the Son and the Emanation in the Spirit, and they say: All of that is what is obligatory to believe in it, even if it is on the authority of the good.The hypotheses are names that they received from the dialogue.The first hypnosis in the divine nature is called a father, and the second is a son, a word, a judgment, a light, a light, a light, a ray, and the third is the spirit of sanctity and an instant, and it is the meaning of their saying: Araklit.And they said in the Bayan and the face of the release: That is because the first hypostasis in a house that is propagated and a principle was given the second -to -one hypostasis that is the second one The action of the mind is his manner and his entire jewelry until the second hypostasis, which is the first image A neighborhood with a comparative principle and a predecessor that requires the similarity of his manners, and here is the same, but it is noteworthy because the second is the divine patience, so it is not the same, so it is not the same, so it is not the first Son, but it was said to the second.Because the birth is not the same as the bodies of the animal and the plant, but the mind does, that is, the father imagines his deeds and his understanding of itself, and no doubt that that image is a word for the word The mind and his authority, and it was said that it was a rule that he was born from the father with the verb of his divine mind, who is a rule, and he was told of the light and a light.Because he was a wisdom in which he was known to the facts of things and their exposure like male, and it was said to the third as a soul that is a charity from the father and the father of the father One of the father and the Son, and the emanating of them with a verb is the heaven of will with love, we love its love, so it is the love of God, and God is the soul of the soul, and the soul is the soul.And for each of the first and the second as a face to be called a spirit for the union, but when the first was called in the name of his arrangement and added it to the second and the second, the second is the second and the second In the name of the rumor, and he was not bound by a son, and if he had the father of the father and his jewel, he is like the son, because he was not issued by the father with a verb that requires a similar one, and he is a similar one, so he is a similar one.Rather, he was released from the will of the will, as the second is one of the first as a one who is from Adam, and the third is like a habit of it, and every truth is one, but it is said to be a son, and it is not said to him.Graduate; Because he was updated because the dialogue comes, and he will be disturbed to lose the Christ, peace be upon him, and the effectiveness and the acting Because they are not the right to be true, and the prophets and the prophecy here are not required as in the events; Therefore, it is not said to the father to a cause and a reason for his son.Then they claimed the embodiment of the second hypostasis, which is the word and its union with the honor of the parts of the domain of blood with the power of the soul of the Holy The humanity and the word, and the word with its union, did not come out of its righteousness, and it did not change because it is the limit that the union ends up with, so there is no one who does not prevent it from In the side of the humanity, God does not intend to come to something.They claimed that the Christ, peace be upon him, was a complete deity and a complete human being with two signs and wounds.Divine and humanity, but two of them, and then they increased in the tipper with a runer and said: The Christ was biting the day of the dialogue, so he said: And you drank my blood, so you fed up with me, and I am united with the father).To the most famous rings are more famous than being mentioned.It is known what we mentioned that there is no difference for them among them that it is said: God Almighty is Christ.And between it is said: The Christ is his son.And between it is said: He is three three.Therefore, each of these sayings came to them, and there is no need to make every saying of people from them as he said otherwise (P-277) from the one who is not.The contradiction is hidden from what they mentioned to the one and the Samid, and their saying: The hypotheses are with them, three, and a distinct, unable Its heroes do not hear and do not enrich me.And what they remember from the example to clarify that, it is about clarification with isolation and far from the intended one thousand hose.We mentioned this book what is related to some of their heads with his response, except that it was before the view in their books, and it was not intended for it On them and today, we have a determination to consume a mission that includes the burning of their criticism in the duty of the Almighty and the remembrance of their likeness And they are reluctant to relieve it, according to it, and we stopped it in their books, with its response to the best of the face, if God Almighty wills.And we ask God to fulfill this.And to ask him for all of us in all our affairs It is the rituals of the horses that did not answer it with the response.
