The Qur’anic researcher said the Almighty who created the death and life is a honesty in detailing some of the rulings of the king and the effects of ability and the two people of their custody on the bolders of judgment and the ruling Galla and the connector is a suitable connection from the first communication, and his connection was to his origin in the testimony of his attribution of glory and glory.Al -Tabarsi was the same as the beginning of the beginning, that is, the one who is etc.The death is what the many people went from the people of the Sunnah, a generous adjective that is hostile to life, and he inferred his body with the suspension of creation with it, and he does not comment.As for what was narrated from Ibn Abbas that he was the Heavy Creation in a picture of the salt of salt that does not pass anything but he died, and he created life in the image Something is nothing but alive, as it is more like the words of Sufism, whose appearance is not reasonable.It was said: It is a response to the approach of the representative and the formation, and the fate is gone, and some of the people of the Sunnah until it is a prominent matter that is the numbers of life, as it is from the matter of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the The recipient of the verse that creation is in the sense of stability, and it is related to the numbers as it is related to the Judaidi, or that the death is not the same A special and like it is related to the creation and creation, based on the fact that giving the goods and if only to give the existence to the goodness in the soul, or the creation of the soul, or the same And the evidence without finding, and it is in this sense that takes place in the numbers, or that the words are in addition to the addition of any creation of the causes of death, or that what is meant by the creation of the death and the life of the death A certainty that only God knows, so that they can find them with a metaphor, and the situation is not hidden in these tiredness.And from the strange thing what was said that he was dead from the world, as it is located in it, and life from the hereafter from where there is no death in it, as if it was said that the one who created the one who created the one who created the one who created the one who created the one who created With the right and the death of what you have heard and life is a generous liquidation without disagreement, and it is what is valid with its existence, the sense or the meaning of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge It was not before the validity of knowledge and destiny, and the death of the death in the estimation of his being is an absolute number, meaning that the life of the life is what it is from the one who is from it Witnesses and in terms of the ability of the later nomadic as it is the same as the reason for the will here means that the life of life is what I described in it so that there is a more and a thorns Mandar and urge the good deed, and therefore he responded: "More than the remembrance of this pleasure and life." And if it is a reason for that harm that those who know that it is a great grace and was a vision, the work of God, the Almighty, has done to it, but it is not the same.It is not necessary in it originally, but (P-5) was mentioned by administering the work of the work on it, and the view was not achieved.And in the two places, it is compensated by the added to it, that is, who created your death, and your life, you who are associated, to give you any to treat you, who will treat you Do any of it and save it, and it will be rewarded for you, and it will be rewarded for a varying meat, according to the devotion of your holidays.And the origin of the elderly administering, and because it requires the knowledge of the knowledge of what he has written, and it is not correct in its right to glory and glory, and carry the words on what is mentioned, and he returns to the one who is not.And the arrogance is composed in it without it without it in rhetoric and what is meant by doing what includes the work of the heart and the work of the wounds, and therefore he said ﷺ in the verse: The forbidden of God, the Exalted and the Exalted, may God bless and exalted.That is, which is a understanding of what is issued by the Lord of God, the Exalted, and the completion of a plunger for what is taken from his speech, they will be given, and the inclusion of the form of the preference is with the fact that the one is the one who is the same By administering their delicate business into good and ugly, not to goodness and good, only to the time that what is meant by the self and the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The improvement with the origin of the origin of faith and obedience in the rest, too, to the maids of the obligations of it.On the authority of the end of the end, or the imposition of those who see the actions of God, glory be to God It is desirable to soften the knowledge of the sciences, the manners of obedience and the dazzling of the preachers of its disclosure, which is not hidden.He made that from the chapter on the divorced majesty or from the chapter on any of the two parties, the best of the place [Mary: 73] is not that of that (and any of you is good) A second effective to let you down, and that is on the scouts to include the meaning of science, and is it called this, or not?It was said: There is a disagreement in the sea of ​​my father, a virginity of his companions, that he is called that he said: If the verb is prepared to two, and the first enemy, and the first is a good, and the first person came.A decision with the words of the appetite or the ritual of the negation, the sentence was suspended from the verb and it was in the position of a stabil The verb from the work.And in the scouts, here it is not called an accord, but the relationship is to sign after the verb that suspends what the lion of the two acts of the two of the two of the lion as a whole: And I learned more than one, and if one of the two verbs is mentioned, I have learned the people, which is better, then it is not a relationship.And the verse is from this tribe and was subjected to the owner The approach is that the science is guaranteed, and it is suspended as the deceased and the pilgrims said, and the remembrance of the verb is obligated with it, but rather the estimation, so that you may know.Also, the secondary sentence is not a second effective, but I have learned, but rather the satellite of the two of the two people in my knowledge, which is a way out because the meaning of this is the one who knows this.The meaning of the estimation of it in its knowledge, which is out of it and it is answered that the two guarantees are singing about the guarantee and the universe of the senior If you are very effective in the first place, let us remove from every Shiite, whichever is more severe [Mary: 69] in the sense that we will tear those who are said to them.Its struggle is a second effective with a interpretation to teach you who are said in their right, whichever is better, and for it the goodness went, then he said: And the owner of the owner said: Relating from one of the two verbs in which there is a disagreement, and the most correct is the one who was chosen by Al -Zamakhshari, and this gravity is his nest in which he brings and knows how to enter.And that he mentioned in the surah of Hood that in the verse, he is attached to what is in the conversation in the sense of knowledge because it is a way to him and the example of him is a saying that he looked at him His words are contradictory and in the revelation that his words are clear that the relationship is in it in the sense of attaching Specialized with the seventy -seventh to two effects.In the question, in particular, without what is in the mother of the appetite, and the like, the Sheikh Ibn al -Hajib stated a text, so it is not contrary to what is mentioned in this surah that is that it is that it is not He denied attaching the famous meaning.As for (P-6), it is a person in the verse of Hudd and the guarantee in the verse of the king to art, so it is not directed to him after his permissibility that it is a matter of ending.Likewise, on this, there is no face to be what there is a choice for the ghost of the mutation and the groans, and there is no choice for another severity, so it is considered and remembered, so that it is a lot.And in the hadith, and God is the Almighty.It is the dear, that is, the majority that is not miraculously punished for those who misunderstood the forgiveness of those who wanted them or for those who repent on what he chose to do so because he is the same.
