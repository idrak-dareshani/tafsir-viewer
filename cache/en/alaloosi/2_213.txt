The Qur’anic researcher is one nation, who are agreed upon by the neutrality of the slaves of the servants when God - the Almighty - has taken upon them, and he is the one who is from the one who is the one who is the one who is from the pledge, Adam and Edris - peace be upon them - based on what is in the ritual of the loved ones, that people in the time of Adam were the ones who were hungry with his debt, where they are in the way Careclies and his followers to the time of raising Adrace, or between Adam and Noah - upon them peace - on what was narrated Between them ten centuries on a project of the right, or after the flood; As it remains after him, only eighty men and a woman, then they died except Noah and his sons, weld, and a fast, and they are, and they were all, and they were all on the religion The first and the last is true, and on the second and the third is a claim by making the few in the ruling of the numbers, and it was said: Agreed upon the ignorance and the infidelity of the one who is more Al -Awafi on the authority of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - that they were disbelievers, and that after raising an administrator - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - until he is a soul.The prayers and peace be upon him - until Hood was sent - peace and blessings be upon him -.So God sent the prophets, that is: they were lost and sent....Etc.Those who believe in the reward.And those who disbelieved with torment - and they are many -, and Ahmad and Ibn Hibban were brought out.“The hundred of one thousand and four thousands,” I said: O Messenger of God, how many messengers?We have told them the verse, so that it will come - if God wills, may the Almighty, and the whole is based on the situation from the prophets, and the most promising is that it is a capacity, and the saying is that it is a state of the state.And the blame book with them was revealed to them, and with them a case estimated from (the book), and it is related to a deleted, and it is not erected by (descending), and the meaning is: His comparison and accompanying the Prophets; Where each one of them took the rulings either from a book that it specializes in or from a book before it, and the books are one hundred and four in the famous; He was revealed to Adam of ten years, and on the thirty -three, and on the age of fifth, and on Moses before the tenth, the tenth, the mourning, the gospel, and the sake of the Koin (the lam) for the covenant and Adam (with them) for the prophets by adopting some; That is: He descended with each one of the prophets his book, and he does not hide What is in the pillar.The truth is related to the descent or a state of the book, that is: a script that witnessed it to judge among the people a cause for the removal of the one who is the first, and for the sake of the first The one who is delayed from the disagreement, so it is not harmful to the mission of Adam, Yaith, and Adrais - upon them the prayers and peace - by building some of the rituals of the ritual, With a corner that (between) was attached to it, and if it was in the sense of (the judiciary), it would be prepared with (on), and the steady guarantee is returned to God - the grace of God - and the grace of it - It was narrated by Maki (let us) with the son of the bone or to the Prophet and the verb.Because the ruler is every one of the prophets, and his return has been permitted to (the book) and the chain of transmission, then a metaphor with the adoption of its inclusion in what is the separation, and the benefit of it.It is imperative that it be in his return to God - the Almighty - who is assigned to the meaning; That is, his judgment appears, and to the Prophet who is costing in the memorial; Where he did not say (to judge), and from what we mentioned, he knows the weakness in it, and what is meant by the people who are mentioned, and the demonstration in the position of the guests of the Ziyad.While they differed in it, that is: in the right that they have disappeared in it, based on the fact that the one of the nation is by agreement on the truth, and if the unit is interpreted by the uniqueness on the one Certainly about the confusion and the analogy of it, and the meaning in which the confusion is upon them, and what was different in it, meaning: in the truth that they disobeyed him and stubborn him, or in the book of the book, with the book They perfected it and the first of it with false interpretations, and the wow is conditional.Except those who have attacked, that is: the book that is to remove the difference and the displacement of discord; That is, they reflected the matter, as they made what was revealed to the ritual of the man, because of its messengers and its rulers.Those who have been - the difference is not ahead of the mission - and he obtained that what is meant is that we seek the opponent of the difference and its increase, and express (removal); To alert him from the beginning of the matter on the amount of the people who can be able to know what is in it from the right, because (the removal) does not benefit that, and it was said: He crossed it to it.Science and study are among those who are different, and they specialize in the remembrance of the more henna of their actions, and because other things they have followed them after what came to them, i.E.Their minds are the phenomenon that indicates the truth, and it is attached to the disagreement of the deleted, and the confusion of the consequence of it is that it will be the one who is in place The verb, and the fall of the disobedience after the letter of the discretion, or from the estimation of the deleted deleted - and in the domain of the supplied, it is not related to what it is suspended He only prevented him as the father said, And for the sculptures in this place, it is the words that it is obtained from the two things in one tool without the kindness that is unable When a divorced group - and separate them if the one who is accommodated from him is reminded with each of the two Mustaqin With the words of the Almighty: We did not see you followed you except those who are lying to us with the opinion, because it is not mentioned in it in the first place, and the ability is in it: what we see you in The opinion and answered those who were not permitted that the monument is with an estimated act; That is, follow and that the custody is sufficient for the act of the verb, so it is permissible in it that is not permissible in it, and it is satisfied with it, and it is the building of the definition in the verse, and the saying of it: Related to what is attached to it (from) from (the prostitute) the darkness or the envy, and between them is attached to the deletion of the adjective in it, in which there is a sign - that it is what I see) At them, he is fasting on them and revolving among them, and there is no greed for him, and there is no refuge in them, and in it, and in which they mark their place in that The extension of the disobedience - and it was said: He pointed out that the prostitute is a shared thing between them and that all of them are traveling, and that is the greatest of the minor in the religion.So God guided those who believed in what they have disagreed with the truth in it with his permission, that is, with his command or by separating him and facilitating him, and (from) Bayan (for what is) In it; The guarantee is a general public for the disappointing and those who follow, and it is not returned to those who have given him like the precedent, and the presidency on that The two predecessors are to disagree with the people of the book and the followers after their disagreement, and it was said: What is meant by (those who believed) is the nation of Muhammad - may God bless him and grant him peace They disagreed with those who have given him, that is, the book, and supported by what Ibn Abi Hatim has been brought out on the authority of Zayd ibn Islam.On the day of the one who guided God - the Heavy - the nation of Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - to the Friday of the Friday, and they differed in the kiss, so he accepted the righteous The sanctuary, and the guidance of God - the Almighty - the nation of Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - for the kiss, and they disagreed in the prayer, so whoever knees and does not find it, And among them who prayed while speaking, and among them who pray while walking, so God - the Almighty - the nation of Muhammad - may God bless him and grant him peace The day is fasting and night, and for those who fast for some food, so God guided the nation of Muhammad - may God’s prayers He was upon him and peace be upon him - for the truth of that, and they were different in Ibrahim - upon him be prayers and peace - and I said to the Juda: He was Juda, and the Christians said: A Muslim, and may God - the Heavy - the nation of Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - for the truth of that.And they differed in Jesus - upon him the prayer (P -103) and peace - and he lied to him to the Jews, and they said to his mother with a great vine And his word, so God - the Almighty - the nation of Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - for the truth of that, and the reading of Abu Bin Kaab: There is a right in it to be his ear to be a testimony to people).And God guides whoever is brought to a straight path 123 and he is the way of the right that does not mislead his values, and the sentence is a decision of those who accepted it.
