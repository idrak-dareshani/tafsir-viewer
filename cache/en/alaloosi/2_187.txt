The two Qur’anic researchers said that his grace and the Almighty: I will be permissible for you for the night of fasting, the ritual fasting to your women.Food, drinking and women were forbidden to him until he breaks out of tomorrow, and Omar Bin Al -Khattab - may God be pleased with him - returned from the Prophet - may God bless him And he had a poison with him, and he found his wife.That is, Omar ibn al -Khattab - may God be pleased with him - to the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - so he told him and he came down.And in the narration of Ibn Jarir, “On the authority of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - while he is a sleeping as a slender, as he asked him for his soul, then his family came to him, then he came to God - Ali and peace be upon him - and he said: O Messenger of God, I apologize to God - the Almighty - and you from my soul is this wrong, for you are decorated with me, so I would fall to me, so I would fall to me, so I would fall to me, so I will fall?He said: “It was not true with that, O Omar.The mediator is from the wall of the cow, so he said: I have the best for you, etc., “The night of fasting is the night, which will become a fasting person, for the addition of the lowest, and the one who is the same The masculine or the deleted is the indication of it, based on the fact that the source does not work in advance, and it is permissible to be a cure to solve because the ritual ravine is in the night In it, it is more than the way, and the spoiler was spilled in his words, and he spoke, and he spoiled, and he is disclosed, and it is more than what he is, and what is meant by it is the collection; Because he is hardly devoid of disclosure, and what was narrated from Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - is that he was sought, and he is forbidden: they are walking with us.Why did you say to him: Did you go?And he said: Rather, the spoiler was what was in the woman, so the spit is in it, it is incurred to be a saying and that it is an action, and the origin is in it to be transgressing (and with me) The hypothesis, and it did not make it the first of the matter as it; Because the intended is (P-65) the intercourse, the distance was packed, and it is the same as what he was in it in all the Qur’an from the deception, the municipality, and the municipality, Being up to what was found before pornography, and that is why he called him a choice after after, and women collect a woman, so it is the collection of collection, or the collection of a woman who is a woman, and it is not the same.Evidence of the addressees of the eternal; It is not permissible for the hypothesis only for those who are specialized in the subject, either by impulsivity or kingdom, and the servant of God has read: (Rafath).It is a dress for you and you are a dress For them, that is: they are dwelling for you, and you are a resident of them, and Ibn Abbas said when he asked him Nafaa ibn Al -Azraq, and he sought - may God be pleased with them - he said: Al -Dhibiyyan said: If the fold of his kindness is the same, it was praised by it, and it was a dress, and when the man and the woman were embarrassing, and they are compassionate from each of them.Looking at his owner with the dress, or because each of them is the owner of his owner and forbids him from immorality, and he came in the news: And the two sentences are desperate, navigational, and the Biany is the same, and their guarantees are a bayna because of the precedent judgment, and it is the few who are in the past And the difficulty of their abuse as the second is beneficial to it, and the man's conversion to the man to them and the lack of patience is the first of the first, and in the news: Carrm and overpowering them, and I love to be a generous generous, and I do not like to be a dominant depth.God knew that you were the two souls of yourselves, a sentence that is subjected to his words, the Almighty: He replaces etc.Because they are in their condition with the lineage, to what was overlooked by them before the replacement, and the meaning of the knowledge of its knowledge, and (the elderly) moves the lust of the human being, or the lust of the man So the meaning is: you are completely excluded by being fully deficient in its punishment, and its luck is from the reward, and it is funded to the meaning: it will be darkened, On him, while their news went before the situation, as it is reported to him for the past and harms, and it is related to science, and what the first formula is understood from the form On the science, he refuses to carry it on the elderly, the gates to it, and a kind of kindness to you (knowledge) and the fulfillment of the trusteeship of the punishment, and the meant The banner who committed you, and forgiven you, that is: it has been impressed by you and removed its prohibition, and it was said: The first to remove the prohibition, and this is for the forgiveness of the sin, then the sin is the sin, then the sin is the sin, His two sayings and exalted: I am permissible for you to look at what is meant by the replacement, which is the removal of prohibition; That is, when we copy from you, the prohibitions are forbidden, and it is the night of fasting, as it is indicated by the next end, for it is an end to the four years that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ones By looking at the action of the copying of the prohibition, and not present in the view of the speech by saying the Almighty: they will be blessed, and it was said: It is if it is true, but it is true The future is called the reader, with a download of the present, and it is what is meant here or that he is used in his right and appreciation, and we have been blessed with you The preacher In the morning, it was released on the collection of its necessity for it.And seek what God has written for you, that is: ask what God Almighty appreciated for you in the revelation of the child, and he is the narrator on the authority of Ibn Abbas and the laughter of God - and may God be pleased with them - And what is meant by supplication is to demand that that they say: O God, grant us what you have written for us, and this does not stop on each one that every one knows that he is able to do it For your people and expressing what we look at the description, as in the words of the Almighty: the sky and what was built it and in the verse is a sign of that the foresight is not to be fired Just spending the lust - because it was - groaning and exalted - he made us the lust of the gathering for the keenness of our kindness to (P -66) as an end, as it made us the lust of the food, to the eaten of the food.And the regeneration of the desire of the lust is not unjust to be only for the Baha'im, and he made some of them this students as a result of the forbidden from the isolation, or from the one who is from Once, it was written at the age and was agitated from the pouring of water in its place; That is, ask for that without isolation and the two reminders - and the most famous of their sanctity - the first is the one who is mentioned in the books in which he does not isolate the man from the man from the man.Her satisfaction, and on the authority of the nation, without her consent or the satisfaction of her master on the difference between the imam and his companions, nor is it unable As there is no right to it.As for the second, the simplicity of the words will come in it on the authority of my face - if God wills Almighty -.It was narrated from Anas - may God be pleased with him - the interpretation of that in the night of destiny, and it was narrated from Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with him - and also from the one who is forbidden) Summary that God has written to you, for God - the Almighty - loves to give his summary, as he loves to give his condolences to him Giving that Ibn Abbas was asked - may God be pleased with them - how this verse is read: they are tempted or (follow)?He said: Which of you was, and you have the first ritual, and they all drink the night, until it is clear, that is: it appears.You are the righteous, and it is the first of what it appears from the honest dawn that is imposed in the horizon before its spread, and it is carried on the dawn of the liar, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one From the stereotype of the stereotype, which extends with the whiteness of the dawn from the injustice of the last night.From the immorality of the two of the two steps, and from it the second is clear, and he specialized in the two people; Because it is the intended, and it was said: Bayan is based on that (the dawn) is a expressive of their entire group because of the saying of Al -Ta’i: ؎ and the dawn of the dawn ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ And the adulterers of your saying: until the scientist will show the ignorant of the people, and with this Bayan, the cheeks came out of the urbanization to the suspicion; Because its condition has a forgetfulness in the kidneys, and the claim that the likeness is the likeness of it, without the Qur’an and the Bayan, it is called on the fact that this is the same as the one who is the same.As they do not need it, and it is permissible to be from the white; Because what appears to be part of the (dawn), as it is a dawn based on that it is a name for the blessed destiny between all and part, and from the first, it was said: for the one who is a luminous The one who is transgressing with it is a source or in the first place for the extended thing, and its mark is that it is good in its interviews or what is beneficial to its benefit, and what is here is not so, so it is not like that It is clear that the two meaning of distinction is clear, and the meaning: until the dawn becomes clear to you, distinct from the wealth of the night, for the absence of what is presented.Until one of them becomes clear from the other and distinguishes between them, and from this as the face of the sufficiency of the confessing until the dawn is clear to you, or the father is shown to you From the dawn; Because the dawn is clear to him, so the ruling will become a beautiful argument in need of the Bayan, and the Bukhari and Muslim are removed from the authority of Sala On the authority of them - he said: I went down and kept and buried, etc.And he drinks until his vision is clear, so God - the Almighty - then: from the dawn, so they knew, but the night and the day, so that it is not for the night, so it is not for me, so it is not for the day The need for the Bayan in which it is not understood by the intended, and that the delay of the Bayan from the time of the pilgrim is permissible for it to be a permissible, that the betrayal is that they are in the way of those who are Why do you wear themselves, and he will support that - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and described those who did not understand the intention of the verse before the verse, and the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who did not.Paying on the level of the level in which the smart and the bid was brought out, so Safayan was brought out by the sons of Ayaynah, Ahmad, Al -Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawid, and Al -Tarmah.- May God be pleased with him - He said: When this verse was revealed (P -67), and they were tired of, etc.My corruption, and I made it to look at them, so the father does not show me from the bonds, and when I became a lunch on the Messenger of God - may God bless him - may God bless him and grant him peace - With the one that I made, he said: “Your corruption is then a disease, but that is the whiteness of the day from the darkness of the night.” Ramadan - and it is a vague - and the Bayan is a warning, except that it is delayed from the time of the speech.In it.And Abu Hayyan said: This is a matter of copying, that you do not see that the companions worked with the backs of what was indicated by the memorizer, then it became a metaphor for the two, and he returns it to what is in it that the one is in what is in it.It is independent and did not guide a copy of this, and in these sans there is an indication of the permissibility of the Sunnah of the Sunnah in the book, but on its authority, based on the one who said that the saying is from the saying Holding, eating, and drinking was steadfast with the Sunnah, and there is no evidence in the Qur’an, and it also indicates that it is indicative On the validity of the fast of the side; Because it is obligatory from the pornography of the municipality to the time of the dawn, its pornography is in the last part of the parts of the night, connected to the morning, then if you fall, then it is the same Its fast was not correct when the missionaries were permissible; Because the jewelry is necessary for it and the incompatibility of the obligatory, it is obligatory for the obligatory, and the perpetrator of the semen does not want after the morning with the consensus before it; Because it spoils the fast for his being the complex of the unanimity, it is a collection that falls in the morning, and it is not necessary for the consensus like the paradise, and it is a violation in the right of the The end is attached to what is in it, and it has the right effects of the two speakers.I also infer the most likely to those who doubted the dawn; Because he - the exalted - permitted what he permitted to be seen by his disclosure, and do not show it with doubt about the king.And it is based on it on the elimination of the judiciary and the situation is this if it was eating after the dawn; Because he ate at the time he is authorized for him, and on the authority of Said bin Mansour like him, and he is not in the publication, and the four imams - may God be pleased with them - are upon them The dawn, so it is not permissible to do anything of the prohibitions after it, and it is contrary to that believer and only the blind is followed, so he claimed that the first of the sun is like the sun.Doing the prohibitions after the soil, and the imamate, and he made from the dawn on the menstruation and the will of the last part of it, and the one who called it for the prayer of the prayer The dawn is not in the night, and it was supported by each other that the grief of darkness with the light, as it was not forbidden from the night after the night of the day, after the time قَبْلَ طُلُوعِها وتُساوِي طَرَفَيِ الشَّيْءِ, مِمّا يُسْتَحْسَنُ في الحِكْمَةِ وإلى البَدْءِ يَكُونُ العَوْدُ, وفِيهِ أنَّ النَّهارَ في الخَبَرِ بَعْدَ تَسْلِيمِ صِحَّتِهِ يُحْتَمَلُ أنْ يَكُونَ In the well -being, and if he wanted him - they are granted and exalted - in this judgment, he said: Eat and drink until the day, then take fast to the night with the night with the one who is more and more It did not do so that the matter is bound by the dawn, not by the throat of the sun, whether it is a day or not, and what is mentioned of my stencils is equal to my way Something with his being, which is not called and does not enrich from hunger, in this section, its opponents can be made by making the first day as the first night, and they are the first of the night, and they are the one who is the night, and it is the one who is the night The fate of the wise man and to the end of the end of the perfection, and it is permissible to be a state of fasting, and it is attached to a deletion, and it is not permissible to make it an end to the positive The two estimates the verse indicates the denial of the night, the place of fasting, and that the fasting of the two days will be one fast, and the ritual of the Prophet - From it the prohibition of the connection as it was said, and Ahmad narrated from the way, "I would like the woman of Bashir Bin Al -Khariti.God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - forbade him, and he said: He will do that Christians, but they are fast as God command So break, and the verse does not indicate that it is not permissible for fasting until the breakfast will be disagreeing with its leaders, (p-68), yes, we will be given to it on the right of the day.That is that his saying is up to the Almighty: then they will complete the one who is given to his saying: they would have said to him to say it, so that he will be shown to him.And blame) in (fasting) for the covenant of what is the original, so it will be the benefit of the time, and then you will complete the command to complete the graceful fasting; That is, the consequences that are inferior to it, whether it is completely brought in its full time, or by its visibility as well as it was broken from the things that are mentioned, Achievement of meaning and then the intention of the fast after a part of the dawn; Because the intention of the action is that it is obligatory when the speech is crowned, and its direction is to complete after the dawn; Because after the part that is an end to the night of the night in the sense of spoofing, and at night, it is only permissible to connect to a part of the dawn, so the nickname will be The immorality that the night was cut off, and the steadfastness was made in it with the absence, then it was said: If it was like that, the must be obligatory That is with consensus, and that the indicators of the two signs - even if it is in the face of one of them, is the first of them For those who did not intend to fast from the night, “and if we said that the intention is before him, he did the news of the deeds of the work of the verse, so we said that the work is done.On what was mentioned - the garment and the news of the one does not oppose it, it is answered that it is the phenomenon of the dahd The report of the recipient of another face, and perhaps what we mentioned is less insured So he managed.And some of the Shafi’i claimed that the verse indicates the duty of discipline;
