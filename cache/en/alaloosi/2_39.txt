was made: “And there is no fear for them,” then for the exile of the renters of fear and sorrow, and I want to follow the guidance of the faith in it, and it was in the end of it.The guardians of the Book of God, the Exalted, are not satisfied with that, or accepting, and those are not fearful for them, nor are they grieving, and the connection is intended to the form of the gathering, to the way of the gathering, And those who are disbelieved in disbelief in God Almighty, and it is possible that they are disbelievers and lied to the neighboring to the neighbor and the boundary, so it is

verse because the verse is called the group as well, as Abu Omar said: With their group, which is a group of the Qur’an, and a group of forefathers, and some of them mentioned that it was called that because it is a wonder that is liked to be miraculous, and it is like it Its origin, and its adultery, sayings: So the Sibuhi, and the successor, went to it, that the origin of it is with glimpses, it turned a thousand to move it, and the conquest of what happened to it.And a vision, as the recipient is at the meeting of the rituals of the other, because it is the place of alienation, and since the Kasayi went to its origin, it is a verse as a verb, and it was a verb, and it was a verb, However, it is blessed by that, so they delete its eyes, and the mortality is that the weight of it is a verb with the eyes of the eyes from the people if they gathered, and they said: The Aki and the lasting appeared in the manner of J, and the second thousand is a replacement of the word, which is the fulfillment of the word, and if it was in its eyes, and they said in the gathering: the mothers, then they are the one who said: Other than the measurement, because it is to move it, and the conquest of what was before it, and the keffians went to the time that its weight is any verse as a seed, so it was raised, and it is in the anomaly as the first, and it is the first The eye, and it was said:
