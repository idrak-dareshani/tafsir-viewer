-Da’i, al -Dahi, On the authority of Ibn Abbas, and in a narration from him an increase that came down after the sacrifice, and Al -Baqa’i claimed that it had a civilian, and in the hadith of a long way, it was brought out by Ibn The servant of God is what is apparent that his saying is the Almighty in it: that with the hardship is easy, with the hardships, it is easy for the city, but in the authenticity of the hadeeth, it is the same, The intensity of communication with the sacrifice of the sacrifice until it was narrated from the people and Omar ibn Abd al -Aziz that they were saying: They are one wall, and they were the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one, and they were the one who was in the one who was in the one who was in the one who was They separate them from “in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful” and on that Shiites as the Tabarsi said of them.The Imam said: And who called for that is that his saying is up to the Almighty: Did we not explain like a kindness on his saying: Did he not find you orphaned and not like that; Because the first was when he was assassinated by the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and he was the case of the disbelief.The chest is good heart, so I am gathering?And in it is a view, and the truth is that the path of that is the novel, not the house, and the frequent ones are two chapters and the chapter between them in the name.Yes, they are very communicated, and it is indicated by what is in the hadith that the son of Abi Hatim was brought up.So I died, and I was guided, and I was a family, so I sang, and I explained to you your chest, and I put you from you, and I raised you for you, so I remember you.الحَدِيثَ.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, did we not explain to you the east of the evil in the origin of the wiping and the expansion, and its resignation (p-166) is common in the clarification, and from it: He wiped the thing, and simplified it is obligatory to show its interior and what was hidden from it, and so is it popular in the pleasure of the soul, even if it was said: It is a truth of the righteousness.And that if he was attached to the heart, as if it was said: He explained his heart with such; That is, he made it with it, because the heart is like the house for the same, and it is usual from the hideout and its expansion is the pleasure of the descent in it, and then if it is attached to the ritual Perhaps this is permissible for the capacity of the heart because the habit is like the ritual that the expansion of what is around the house is, but it is if the house is wide, then it is not possible.Ziada with a glow and its part in it, and it will take from it to the pleasure of the same.It may be intended if it is related to the heart or the chest, too That is a place for it, so when it was a lot, it was required for its place to be wide to expand.And it may be intended to multiply the souls of that, so it is also: it is imagined that the multiplication of its information is called, and it is called, and it will be removed from it To download it is a house of its place, and it may be intended to support the soul with a powerful force Mechanisms, a throne of the types of manifestations, and a brush for the fences of the universes, so it is not occupied by a matter of a matter, and he is equal to his religion, it will be, and it was.And his attribution to the chest on the part of what passed, and the will of the heart of chest and soul from the heart due to the relationship From what was mentioned by the century of the shrine, and the proportions of the place of the two dedicated here are the will of this last meaning.And it was permissible other than it, the meaning: Did we not wipe your chest until the containment of my world of absence and testimony, and gathered between my property to benefit and benefit from what is the one who repelled you I have been confused by the lights of spiritual communication, and what is related to you is the validity of creation from the darkening of the affairs of the truth.It was said: The meaning: Did we not descend your concern and your clouds with your knowledge of the affairs of the affairs and the despicable contempt We wipe it with wisdom and expand it by facilitating you, you will receive what is revealed to you after what was made to you.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas and a group that it is a sign of the slit of his honest chest in his boyhood, peace and blessings be upon him, and this slit has fallen into some of the news, while he was in the authority of the news; It was narrated that she said in his affairs, peace and blessings be upon him: He likened the tongue, and he did not reach his Sunnah until he was a generous boy, so we came to him on his mother and we kept something on his survival, from what we have to do with us, So we said to his mother: If you left him with us until he was overwhelmed, then we are afraid of a maaka epidemic.After our older one or three years with his brother from breastfeeding, we have a successor to us.We left our homes.In a white, he hid him and his stomachs, so I and his father were brought up.A man came to me with a white clothes, so he fell asleep, and he stained me, then he was broken from him, so he was rejected by him, then he narrated it, and then he said: I have been afraid that my son had been afflicted and divorced He turned it up to his family before he appeared with him what we were afraid, and she said: So we gave him to his mother, and she said: What did you return to you?Have you been free to him?We said: We fear the difference and the events.So I said: What are you doing?So you did not call us until we told her.She said: I was afraid of the Satan, not by God, what the Satan is upon him a way, and it is a cake for my son, this is a matter, so he called him to you.And the son of Asakar, what indicates the consequences of the occurrence of this to him, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was a sweetness, and he has signed for him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, who is the Almighty, and may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him He was upon him and peace be upon him.The matter of prophecy?So the Messenger (P-167), may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was sitting, and he said: “I have asked Abu Hurairah, that I am in Sahra, Ibn Ashbar, if he is one of two years My head, and if a man says to a man: He is, he is, so they accepted me with his faces, and he did not see her with a fully created, and as long as I found it from the creation of a cat, and the clothes of it.They came to me, even if they came to me, take each one of them with my support, I do not find that I take them touched, so he said to one of them to his friend: So he wrapped it when I see without blood or pain, and he said to him: He went out of the thick and the envy, so he brought something like the bodies of the relationship, then we rejected it, so he said to him: The one who broke out the likeness of the silver, then the thumbs of my feet, and he said: The explanation of the Hamziyyah by Ibn Hijjar al -Maki is the narration of this news with another memorial and in it: One of them says to his friend: It is it.The exile of the fell of a ritual before it is that it is that the prophets were not felt from him, this is not what he accepted, and he was upon him the prayer and peace be upon him as well Peace be upon him in the neighborhood in the cave of Hara, and who narrated that of the good and the inheritance in their chain of transmission, as well as the father of Naim and his memorization: that Jabril and Mikyil, peace be upon him He washed it, then he said: Read in the name of your Lord.Al -Bukhari, Muslim, Al -Tarmahi, and Al -Nasa’i, on the authority of Qutdah, said: Anas ibn Malik told us about

the water in which the water of Zamzam is so and so.” Qatada said: I said: It means Anas: What do you mean?He said to the lower stomachs?He said: “So my heart was broken, and he was washed with the water of Zamzam, then he returned his place, then he was fed up with faith and wisdom, then he came with a bead without the richest, and the righteousness Jabril, peace be upon him, until the worldly sky came to us.The miracle is presented to the prophecy, and it is not permissible and its fall after the prophecy, and if it is not necessary for it what was mentioned, except that what was mentioned with it from the hadith of the hadith and the hadith Mercy, the stuffing of faith, and the rule that he is referred to is that the washing is what does not affect him in the spirituality of the spiritual, but it is to remove the matter of my body, and that it is not true, and it is not correct.It is something that God creates in the heart and is not with anything, for if you offer the supernatural to the prophethood, it is permissible for us and we call it a lot, and the news is a lot of it.Prayer and peace before the prophecy, and the washing of water was to remove a physical matter, and it is not far from being removed and washed the place with a special water as a mullah The narratives, and therefore Al -Balaqini said: It is better than the water of the clothing obligated to the way of the mood, and it is what he has in the spirit of the spirituality, and therefore he commands the sake With the whiteness that the mood is turned on, and it is raised to that, the same is the same and the ethics of the soul and the elderly.For example, the entry of what is in it is obtained as a talisman of that and many of what is called the cause of the cause of the cause, and it is required that it be on his right, and he said.My father, as in the religious talents of the sake of the sake of what he has obtained: what the words of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, are upon him The creatures that are not for the senses to their perception is a way that is as it was indicated by his words, peace and blessings be upon him, in the soul
