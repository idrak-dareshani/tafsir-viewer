The Quranic researcher (P-355), or do you want to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before the permissible in (Umm) this is that you are connected, and that you will be in the authority of You know, before you want to build on the connotation of the race, and it is you not to know, and the context is the resting, for it is only when it was cursed, and the knowledge is, and the knowledge of it, and the knowledge of it, and the knowledge of it, It was said: That is, the two things are from the numbers of knowledge with what was presented, or the knowledge with the rest of the rest, and the understanding is then for the denial in the sense that it is not possible, and it is not that it is that it is not.It was interrupted to the Arabs from their knowledge of the precedents to the confession of their restrictions as the rest of the Juda Some of them, by cutting, based on the entry of the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the speech or not, and the number of his entry into it is here, because he is unknown, and there is no one who is over.By calling, and it is answered that it is not without it, to obtain it on the basis of the intention, and the will of the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was upon him.And the resignation of what we presented is that it is the way of the kiniyah, and what is meant by the two estimates is the one who is Muslim, the Muslims, with the trust of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace The rest after the response of the entrusted or the Jews in the copying, as if it was said: Do not be when I descend to you from the Qur’an like the Jews And the rest of it, and they are misleading and atone after faith, and in this way as the fullness of the vagina and rhetoric, even as if they were in the will of the will, then they are the same, then they are the same, so they would be the same, so they would be from the question, so they will be the same, then they would be the same, so they would be the same, then they would be from the will, so they would come from it.It means that the sane person does not confront the will of that, and he did not say his pursuit: as he asked the nation of Moses, peace be upon him or the Jews, for the point that he asked that whoever asks that The tongue is preserved from its remembrance, and the precedent of the rest is required of them, and the two guarantees do not stop the verse on it, as the ritual is not required A disbelief as it indicates what is after it, and it is hard to fall from the believer, and from what our remembrance appears and the face of this is the same time Some of them are fixed on the verses, and their trust in them, and as for his two, that they may be asking for him to pray and peace be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.Therefore, the verse of the copy was buried with that, so I see it to wish, and some of the boys were mentioned, “They are close to the Messenger, peace be upon him.The conquest is good for them to make them the same, as the polytheists had, so the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: God, as God had the gods And who is my soul in his hand, to ride the Sunnah of those before you, the example of the tenderness, and the slander of the slander, if the one who comes to you, then what is the mother of you, then what is the mother of you Hurry or not?Al -Rida: If the two verbs are bought in the actors, you are a mother: a mother, you are sitting, (a mother) is connected, and the people claimed that the one who addresses it, and that the one who is the one who has been, and that the one who has been, and that the one who is the one who has been, A book of the sky is revealed to them as a sentence was descended from them, as the mosaic has come to Moses, peace be upon him, and he addressed them after that, after they stabted them, and he was guided by them The harms that come in the sense of the past, except that he crossed it for him in bringing to the heinous images, and the choice of this Razi Imam, and he said: It is the most correct, because this is the one who says: I will remember my blessing about the Jews and the argument with them, and because their remembrance was ran, and the remembrance of others has been done, and because the believer is not the one who does not ask.It is changed by the disbelief with faith, and he does not hide what is in it, as if he has mercy on him, may God bless him, the Almighty saying: O you who believe, do not say, and say: The people of Makkah, which is the saying of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, and it was narrated from him that the verse was revealed in the servant of God, the son of Umayyad, from the authority We have a gly, and we expand the land of Makkah, and we have spread to us the rivers through it, and we believe in you, and it was said in the cause of the descent other Make all reasons, and on the dispute in the addressees, the words come in your Messenger, if the believers are the addition of the same thing And he greeted, and if they were others, they are on the same thing without the declaration, (and what) is a source, and the famous is that the mourning is a mourning for a minor.Sibuyeh is that he is in the position of a position in the case, and it is possible for him to ask him, that is, the question (as), and he authorized Al -Hawafi to be (what) in the way With it, to ask, that is, like the things that he asked, peace be upon him, before, and it is the proportions, because the denial of them is for the corruption of the conquerors, and the one in the punishment, And in it is a look, because the likeness (to ask) is a source, so it is clear that the likeness of it is like that, and the question is the question, but it is the ugly of the question, but the question is from the question Selfishness in some cases with the fact that the source does not need the estimation of a link, then it is the first, (and from before), it is attached to the question, and it comes to it, and it comes to it.Namal (Sil) with a fracture of a fracture, and Abu Jaafar and Al -Zahri with the tent of the huge hinger, and Y, and some of them with the tenderness of the ham And whoever changes the infidels with faith, it has lost whether the path is a transmitted sentence, which is disgraceful to the ruling, and it was brought out to the one who came out of the same, for the one who came to the one who comes from the same The concept of the concept is from its saying: Or do you want, etc., it is given to it, so it is a distortion of it by adopting that the two who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The evaluated, the one who is evaluated, (both) in the sense of the simplicity, or the equal, and the addition from the door of adding the description to the description of the purpose of the exaggeration, as if it is the power of the power, as if it is the power Even on the curriculum of the image of the image in the image that is obtained, and the loyalty is a tie, and after that it is not valid that the condition of the condition is that the misguidance of the straight way is stable Record, and the increase is not arranged on it, and because the penalty if it was past with (may) was remaining on the past, because (he) is not to be investigated, and he did not make sure, and he did not make sure, The past is arranged on the future, and because the condition of the condition is harmed, and the penalty is past, a weak image that did not come in the book, the dear, to what was stated by the one who was stated by the one who was pleased with it The estimation is that it is said: Whoever changes the infidels with faith, then the cause is in which he left it, and the meaning is based on the fact that the misguidance of the righteous way, which is the disbeliever in the righteous, is the disbelief And the increase, and the bit of them was interpreted by the release of the confidence in the verses by adopting its being, as it is necessary for it, so it will be the same as it, and it is the same The trustworthy verses that are revealed according to the reconciliation that the verses of the verses that are transcribed by the verses that are the best is the best, and the right of it, He knows about the straight path that connects to the factors of truth and guidance, and lost in the end of the passion, and he wanted in the vastness of the guidance, and the choice of what is in the generous organizer is not from the first thing That is a disbelief and increase, and perhaps what we have given us to the first, as it is not hidden from the arrangement, and it is read (and whoever is replaced) from the beginning, and the slurring of the signifier in the opposite and the two readers.
