The researcher, when Moses said to his people, O people, that you have wronged you, with your hurry to take the hurry The pardon is a worldly grace in the right of the rest, but he separated between them with his saying: And when he came to us, etc., because the intended is the number of nations, so the numbered One, and it was said: This is the verse and what is after it is interrupted by what it was presented from the remembrance of the blessings, and there is nothing, and the blame in (for its people) The alert is that Moses's speech for his people was a revelation, not by the middle of those who receive from him, such as the speeches that are mentioned before He was pronounced, but one of him is a commander, and his measurement is not to be collected, and his collection was distracted by arrests, and the most famous is his choice with the men of his saying: His saying: There is no women from a woman, and Zahir said: “So I will know, and I will know the best of the horses of the horse, or it was said: For his words, the Exalted: We sent Noah to his people and the first is the one, and the people of the women are on the way to follow the followers, the crime and the metaphor, the best of the rituals, Because they are doing what the women do not do, and in the way of Moses on them with the call, and its calls to them (with a ritual) marking the time of them, and for them, and from them, and from them, and from them, and for them, and for them, and for them, and for them, For their acceptance of the matter after their readers, they have wronged themselves, and the B is in your taking a captive, and in the time, here is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who takes the forefront, so there Your innocence is the fulfillment of the cause, because the injustice is a reason for the repentance, and you have turned after it after that you have been wronged and the argument in the expertise and the construction of the In Waw, and the phrases of some people feel that it is for the cais without kindness, and the verification is that they are with them, and the innocent is the one who created the creation from the righteousness The members and the compassion of the parts to be one of the hands in the absence of the younger, the tenderness, and the other with its disagreement, and the distinction of each other from one, with the sake of the sake, From the Creator, the origin of the installation of the creation of the thing and its separation from others, either on the way of detailing the greatest of the sickness, or the creation, the greatest of God Distinguished from the pollution of the clay, and in its remembrance in this place, it is brought up with the absence of the worship of the wise scholar who has acquitted them with the good wisdom of their rule To the authority of God Almighty, and we will go down to his command to dismantle their creation (P-260), and to spread what they are in their images and their forms, when they did not And they dictated it to the worship of those who are not able to do anything from Gobo and the country, and Abu Amr (your innocence) read to seize, and the tranquility was also narrated from him, and it is from the conduct of the connected from the two words of the course Graduation of faces that do not abandon abnormalities.Kill yourself the fulfillment of the punishment, and the one who is killed by the killing known from the chain of narration of the soul, and a group of the interpreters, and the verb, is the verb, Their repentance was the killing, either in their own right, or the repentance of the stretching is released in the project of peace be upon him, so what is meant by saying: The repentance is to be valid, and if it is the denunciation, and the killing of its mourners, like the excess of the grievances in our partner, then it is on its own, and there is no form, and it is said: For the eyes of the killing, and there is no need for the interpretation of (repent) with determination, but make the fulfillment to the interpretation, as you make the waw for it, and it was said to him, and he said to him.So we impeded them in the day and the appearance of the matter that they are commanded to preach every killing of itself, and in some antiquities that they commanded that they kill some of them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they will kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, so they would kill them, Then to kill some of you, as he said: Do not kill yourself and do not meet yourself The hurry is to kill those who worshiped him, and the meaning is upon him: Surrending themselves to kill him, and he called Islam to kill, killing, on the authority of the reward, Those who dispersed with Harun, peace be upon him, and those who were with him, peace be upon him, and in the way of killing is a news that we do not lengthen its remembrance, and the sentence of the one, The repentance descended, and the encrypted from their hands, and the judge, Abd al -Jabar, denied that God be the Almighty, the children of the children of the people of killing, and he said: A mind, as the matter is for the revenue of the cost, and after the killing if it is a measure to be a reconciliation, and this judge did not realize that the judge is that we are not.We keep it, and with its command, we will deny it, and that it has after this life that is a playful and a Sarid life, and with an eternal glow, and that the last house is that the last house is that With his affairs, he connects her to a good life of it, and who knows that the human being is in this worldly as a resurrection that is established in a vulnerability that he proceeds That the king commands him with his exit by himself, or he commands others to be exalted, and this is clear to the one who depicts the two states of the world and the last, In them, and among the people who have been permissible, except that he followed his fall and said: The meaning of killing themselves is humiliated, and from that, he said: “He is the one who said:” Her mothers were killed, and she was not killed Were it not for the narratives on the dispute of that, I would have interpreted it, and it was reported that it was read (so he gave themselves to yourself), and the meaning is that it is the same With this great action that you have used, and I have been destroyed, so they will be given to the garment, the commitment of obedience, and the effects of those taboos to the appearance of obedience.That is better for you, with your innocence, a sentence that is exposed to the urbanization of the repentance or an instrument, and the signal to the concept is what is made, and it is done.His proliferation was deleted, and they were deleted in the poetry.Separation, or better than the fruit of disobedience, which is the permanent destruction, and the speech at the limit of honey is sweeter than vinegar, or a good one of the goodness is for you.(P-261) And Hadiya is a metaphor, and the innocent is repeated with the memorial of the phenomenon, in order to urge him to see him in every case.As he saw the creation, he was more likely, he saw the execution, and he was a good thing, and he was the wise knowledge.He admires a condition that is deleted with the ability to be able, if it was from the words of Moses, peace be upon him, for them, his appreciation is if you do what you have commanded A deleted, if it was a speech from God, the Almighty, as if he said: You did what you have commanded, and you will admire you with your innocent By the memorization of the people, and it is from the prestige of the absence, or from the spoke to the absence in (he repeatedly) where he did not say: So we are repenting, and the kindness was likely to have the peace of the instrument, The answer, and in the evidence of that from the Arabs is an article, and the appearance of the verse is that it is a news about the mourning of the two murderers, the two of that, and the son of God said: He killed a testimony, repented from the rest, and pardoned them, so he (upon you) has been on him on your rest With the killing when it was hard on the soul, it is its grace that it is the one who agrees with it, and it is easy for it, and it is overwhelmed in the one who comes to it, or it is for it, or the one who comes to it, He admires you and interprets the repentance from it, then the acceptance of the repentance of the sinners, and the affirmation of the predecessor of the mortar The tendency is that if it is the guarantee of the one, then the light is a beginner, and it is the proportions of its affairs on the same as the oath of the pursuit of the sentences of the sentence, and if it is a return to the righteousness, then it is a return to the Al -Marfa is either a chapter or a beginner, this is the luck of this story that he knows that his life is in a hurry of the children His God took his mouths, and that God has created his soul in the origin of the innate, restored to the acceptance Right, and promotion to the Jerusalem of the Jerusalem, and the presence of mankind, and this is the book that Moses Al -Qalab, and the difference that is in its light in the loyalty of the Lord, When the soul was made to the earth, followed its whims, and its lusts affected its money, it was commanded by killing it by breaking its lusts, and it was made for its lusts, and it was made for the sake of its lusts.The annihilation, and the awakening after the erasing, and the realistic repentance, only the human beings, with the afflictions of the most important, and this is the greatest jihad, and the death.No, whoever dies, then the dead is left, but the dead is dead, and this is difficult, and it is only easy for the sake of the truth, and the men of sincerity, and the sign of the reference, The first feet in the servitude is to destroy the soul and kill it by rubbing the desires, and cut it off from the sanctuary, so how the prayer is to something from the homes Hey, that is isolated from us, and the regrets of the richness of us.؎ Come on.
