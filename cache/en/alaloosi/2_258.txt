The Quranic researcher sees the pilgrim who is a pilgrim in his Lord, a bias to redeem the believers, as they were their guardian and let them down, and therefore he did not kindly, and he did not.Hope for the believers many, and it was said: A guidance of what he mentioned is that the disbelief is the first of them, the tyrant and a report to them, as it is not after it.For the believers and a report for it, and he began with the pioneers of the one who is between him and between his sins and his argument with the matter of a wondrous thing that is a matter The need in God is glorified and exalted, and what he brought about in the vicinity of the bone calling for the gaps of his feet He has indicated in his success to his gifts, also with the mediation of Abraham, peace and blessings be upon him, because what is narrated from him from the ritual to the truth and the righteousness of the truth It is not exalted and does not hide what is in it, and the gossip of the interrogation of the denial of the negation and the report of the exile, and the gathering is that in the words the meaning of the arrogance, that is, what is the same, To the story of this infidel, which I have been in his guardian, how to confront the argument of those who guarantee his support and I have been told that I am for him and whoever is from him The vision of this wondrous story achieved and it was decided that the matter is from the appearance, in which it is hardly hidden from one of the one who has the same Al -Qasawi from the achievement of what I mentioned to you from my guardian for the believers and its numbers for the disbelievers, and to detect your soul, O beloved, and preach, and we will be blessed, The shrine of the cell is from Al -Habib, and the heads of the tyrants failed, so how are the virtues of the virtuous sins, and what is meant by the person is the one who is a son of the son Rabbiyyah, as Mujahid said and others, but he was released on what he had been kept in the argument, even if it was arguing with falsehood for its revenue, and it is in the time of it Fracture of idols and kissing him in the fire, which is the narrator of a fighter and was said: After his meeting in the fire and made it a cold and peace, which is the narrator of Jaafar al -Sadiq About him, and in exposure to the title of the narratives with the addition to his guarantee of prayer and peace be upon him, he will be honored for him and Emahan (P-16) from the first thing in the first thing and for him to be in the first thing Drinking is a type of the mandate.That God has given him the King, that is, because God has come to him, so that the words are done by the pain of the mother, and he is stripped in that, and that there is no effective for the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the And the explanation is in it on two sides: either the possession of the king carried it on that, because it is the heir of the arrogance and the hero, so the argument was raised from them, or it is from the other The words in the sense that he put the pilgrimage to the place of the thanks, as it was his right to thank you for that, for the first: the cause is a verbal, and the second: So, so, so that I had improved to him, and it was permissible to be the one who was fell as a matter The argument did not fall into the time of the king, but the gathering is before it, and that the grammarians stipulated that it does not take place in the place The ritual of the stars and the shouting of the rooster, and it is not permissible if it was worried and if it shouted.And I answer the convergence of the time, and that the text is opposed to the fact that they stated that (what) the export is on the authority of time, and it is not a good, Granding and the whistle in the “explanation of the book”, and the truth is that the illusion of what was able to be agreed upon is free from what is said that it is not said that it is not possible for it to be amended, not the one who is in the past and the one who is in the authority By increasing and committing the saying of the son of Gin and the whistling with his violation of the words of the phrase in an end of arbitrariness.And the verse is a pilgrimage to those who prohibited the payment of God, the King, to disbelievers, and carry it on the coming of God, the Almighty, what he prevailed over and overwhelmed by money, servants, and followers, or to God, or on the authority of God His worshipers, as the man, who said the pursuit of the righteousness, did nothing, as he who has a holding of fairness knows that there is no meaning for the death And if he was peaceful, in the coming of the causes, the question will be directed, and if he was peace, then there is a chaos, unless he can be considered a saheeh, like the two of the two, and this is the power of this.Some of them made a guerrilla that he brought to the Abraham, peace be upon him, because he is the Almighty.Great, and he is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the ritual of the foolishness, and it is not hidden that the disagreement of the rafts to the mind and the disagreement of the interpretation is the righteous, and the occurrence of the righteous.For the sake of peace, peace be upon him, as this is a king, and there is no dispersal, nor influence.Some of the imams went to the fact that the king who is not given to God for the disbelief is what was in the matter of the matter Consent as we have a result, so it is not what he does not have to be cursed in it, or there is two words in it, and the saying that this is the one who is given the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Equity, but the one who has been given in the truth, is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, except that he was exposed in his king He went on and has a gallon and then goes away, and it is The words are close to what is right, but I am more scent than the wind of misguidance, and it is revealed to me that it is an illness of the people, and God Almighty knows the treachery of the eyes and what is hidden from the ritual The appearance in this place is not hidden.As Abraham said a paradise for Hajj, and it was permissible to be a substitute for (I came) based on the saying that you taught, and the father of Hayan exposed it to the one who was the one who is the one who is the one It is not the time for the sake of peace be upon him, my Lord, who revives and dies.King: Who is your Lord who calls me?Al -Saqbasi answered the permissibility in his coming and the will of the will to give up the two of it, but rather the time of the king, which is a stretch that expands two sayings, but rather the words of the father, and the father was supposed to be.Al-Kafr, even if (P-17) was a mistake, was not a mistake, except that it was made (when) in the sense that the export was, and that came, and Al-Halbi said: And this is based on it that it is that it is a matter of it.And there is no sign of the fall of the category, but if it is a satellite, it is not a mistake, but rather, but it is all the way of each of each, and in it what is presented from the words, and it is said that the words are: Instead of his gathering, and I would like to form all of them, so he signed his saying, he said: He said: “I will live and my illiteracy, except to make a question.With the pity of the vision, it refuses to do so, and from here it was said: The disobedience is attached to his saying of his chains: He said: I am etc., and the question is estimated before he said: He answered what was answered, and it is not hidden that the fathers are the fathers, for the first saying is one of the first thing that this saying is a statement of his saying, the grace of the By his deletion, and peace be upon him, he lives and dies, he created life and death in the bodies, and the curse wanted otherwise, so he narrated that he was narrated from him.The other left and said what he said, and when this was isolated from the intended, and it was his heroes from the evacuation and the appearance in terms of where he is not hidden from one of those who are in the same way The one who has been shared by prayer and peace be upon him, from his heroic, and he came with another indication of the sun.Abraham said that God brings the sun from the outskirts, so he came from it from the Maghreb, and there is an indication on the permissibility of the argument of the argument from the Hajj to the last one, and it is clear from it, In it, and it is pregnant with this one of the two ways that are famous in the verse, and the second is that the resignation is in the example as if he said: My Lord who finds the places and the possibilities And death is an example, when it was imposed, he came with an example of a motivation for the rough The suspicion of the suspicion, if the suspicion is mentioned and that suspicion is listened to the hearing, and the right is required to mention the answer to mention the answer in the case of removing the reason The minds, when he stabbed the individual in the evidence [the first] or in the first example of those suspicions, the preoccupation with its removal was a constant and a comprehensive duty, so how can it be a good.And the resignation to something else?The second: that when he was invalid, the question was left the right to speak to him and his alert at his weakness, which necessitates the stall of the seat of the messenger and the authority of the Messenger of the Messenger Featured.And the third: that if it is [good], the transmission from one is to another or from an example to otherwise, but it must be the transmission to it, and it is clear to us, and it is clear.Likewise, because the hatred of life is not able to create it, and as for the sweetener of the sacrifice of the bodies, the creation is able to it The corpse will be a moving for the heavens, so this [the estimation] is the one who is the same The infallible is to move from the clear indicators to the hidden evidence?And the lord: that the murid, when it was not possible from the opposition of life and death, who are sincere from God, are the Almighty with killing and abandonment, so how does he believe in him from the authority of the authority He says: Rather, the sun is out of the past, so if you have a god, then say to him until he will be brought from the Maghrib, and when this is the opposite of the investigator, this is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the right It was [from] the duty to be informed of the Maghreb, and it is known that the preoccupation with the purification of the corruption of his question in life and death is more easy for this It is estimated that the sun of the sun gets out of the strangeness, the indicative of the existence of the prevalence is this one, not the first pride, and then, then it becomes like that.Likewise, and also, what is the one who carried the caliph, peace be upon him, leaving the answer to the blessed question and touched with an indication that cannot be walk With the estimation of that, the second evidence is lost as it is lost (P-18), and it is known that the commitment of these warnings does not fit the least of the people, the knowledge of the knowledge And teach the silver.The truth is that this is not another indicative or an example, but it is the first indication of the first evidence, and that is that what was brought up by the peace of peace be upon him, with the abundance of God, and he is the word That if you claimed life and death without a median, then do not find it to prove it as a way.For good news, the caliph, peace be upon him, answered That life and death, and if they obtained the intermediate movements of the orbits, but those movements were obtained from God Almighty, and that is not praised in the costume of life and the abuse of the creation of the creation of it They have the sake of the orbits, so there is no generosity, and the death of them will not be, and when the verse is carried on this direction, nothing is obligatory from it).And he does not hide what is in it; As for the first: because the suspicion is if it is in the end of the stroke and the end of the heroes, in which it is hardly hidden from its condition and no one is tempted by the people, and the symptoms are not forbidden Pinfing for eagerness and exclusivity to what is intended for many of the many, and there is no stipulation of stipulation, nor a garment of affairs, and any stipulation of this For the minds, so that it will be the work of its removal and a sufficient obligation, so it will be left to leave it with the informative that it was narrated that he did not move until it is to the one who said to the one Where he said to him: You have lived alive and did not revive the dead, and from the sincere, may God be pleased with him, he said to him: He greeted those who killed him, if you are true to you The commitment to us in the book is a great corruption, and secondly: because it is clear that the transmission is clear to him in the intended one who is transmitted from the vengeance of the vengeance of the vengeance of the vengeance By reflecting it, it will be perseverance, and what he mentioned in the presentation of the recipient is not hidden from what is in it, and as for third: because what he mentioned is a chain of narration, he also responds to the face of the face, as he does not.The one who wants to say that if the banks of the orbits were from your Lord, then say to him until he will be given from the West, then what is the answer here is the answer and they have answered the words The argument was after his salvation from the fire, so he knew that whoever was destined for that was able to come with the sun from its strangeness, then it was silent, or that it is, or it is the one who has been blessed We have the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he is weak, but the answer is that peace be upon him.The perplexing is an axiom, and it is evident that it is not a panther, and he said: He is my Lord, so if you claim that you are the one who did it, then he came from the Maghreb, and this is not the same.If he claimed that the movement of itself is with it that it was preceded by it, even if it was of all the movements.With the abuse of that situation, there must be from the confession with a verb that comes from the outlook, and the claimant is that that the act is the Lord, and as for the one: because it is not the one who does not see it With a face, and the words of the disbeliever are only the claim of life and death, and it was not felt from it.Al -Falakat and did not stand for him on a trace to respond to those of those movements as well as from God Almighty, so they do not praise their mediators in the costume of life and death from it A merit of this, and perhaps the appearance of what the Imam went to what was mentioned by some of those who invest He claimed to him as a sinner from the sake of the Sabbath, that God Almighty delegated to the makers of mobilization and the acts of creation and other than the descendants of it.The earth is also the one who delegates to it either a saying with solutions, or for the suffering of the properties of the whole, or otherwise, that the peace be upon him, peace be upon him, wanted him to repent to him The arrangement and corruption of his opinion on the authority of his fierce knowledge that he is a newborn, after that he was not (P-19) and that whoever does not have it is not for him The one who is the virginity of the good is the harm of its constitution to the founding and the perpetrators, and this is sufficient in the absence of the claim of the curse, so the pretext was not permitted in the abundance of it.He was revealed to me from where there is no difference between finding and hostility, two types, which are life and death, and the one who is able to find every possible and its numbers is obligatory for him to be obligated.From all the faces, because the pluralism must be possible and limited, as they have been shown to him in his place, so the cursed opposition to what is delusional is that it is permissible for him to be the one who is permissible for him to be.The actor in staying, as some of those who are speaking, are delegated to him after finding him what he said by finding others and the mobilization of others.On the authority of the idiots, and he said: I live, I am illuminated, and I showed it, indicating that the inhabitants of the ruling on the periphery of life, and it is in that contradictory.Likewise, the mobilization was not delegated to other than the righteous, and it was not used to the existing one, otherwise it is not for the sake of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a life.The caliphate, peace be upon him, is that the Qadir does not divide the lineage to it always and calling for it, for God Almighty brings the sun from the righteous, so it is from it The removable contradiction is declared that it is a mistake in the action of the verb always until it is not supported by the appearance of the shore of the sins, so it was not the same.Word and reply to the speeches and betting, which the face of it is received by a volume or a hatred with the curse, in which there is no room for the symptoms of the symptoms, and the symptoms of the symptoms.One and not from the expulsion to another indication of what is in it from the gossip and the say, nor from the entirety to an example that clarified until it is said as if it was said: my Lord who is the one There are possibilities, and he came with life and death, for example, when he was supposed to come in the last, he was a motivation for the roughness, because it is with it that it is in the first thing that is the one who does not want it to be.The argument, as this is not hidden, and God Almighty knows the truth of his glorious writers, and he managed.Rather, it came in the second sentence in the generous name, and it was not taken by the address of the grapes, as it came to it in the first sentence that it is said: My Lord is in the absence The significance is upon his Lord, upon which he is upon him, and that is the one who wants to be cursed.Confirmation that the matter is for the miracle and the first fulfillment of the permission to suspend what is after it before it, and the meaning if you claim life and the death of God, and God bless you The rest of the mind and the joking of the tuberculosis and forms (God comes with sun), etc.And the costume for the transgression and (from) in the two people to show the end is attached to what it presented from the verb, and it was said: attached to the deletion of any case, any of the places.So I disbelieved, which disbelieved, and he became a distress, cut off from the words, confusing to give the pilgrimage to it, and read (with) with the) By opening the first and breaking the second, and they are two languages, and the verb is necessary and (with) with their conquest, so it is permissible to be necessary, and (the one), and the one who is).And his actor is a guarantee (Abraham) and (the one who) is his act, that is, he overcame his honor, peace be upon him, and he silenced him, and the infidelity is in the matter of the prayer of the prayer.Alkia: In the verse, there is an indication of the permissibility of the argument in the debt, even if the argument of this infidelity is disbelieving.And God does not guide the unjust people [258], that is, to the curriculum of the truth as he guided his guardians, and it was said: He does not guide them to the way of paradise on the Day of Resurrection.
