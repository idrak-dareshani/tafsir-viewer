saying of the Almighty: They deserved to be ashamed, because they disbelieved the grace of the food that is for them, and they are in the essence of hardship and tired, where they asked (and for me).I have seen it, as patience is the love of the soul in the straightforward, and therefore he denied them with his words, the highest: you will be dispensed, etc.And if you say, Moses, we will not

prophets, and if he said: So their question is not that food is disobedient, and the food is described with a bond, even if they were the foods of the one who is the one who has been in the rituals of the one who is in the end of the day It is said: The food of the one is the same, and if it was different colors, in the sense that it does not change and does not differ from the calculation of the

only what they fulfilled, and it was said: They were cooked with them, and he would become one food, and he said that one of the saying is that Before the descent of the loyalty, we descended from the saying, and the saying of it was that they wanted the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was a drink or something that is a good one, and something that is in it.Another, otherwise the saying descends that he crossed the one from the two, as it crossed the two of the two, in the gram of the one who comes out of them, but the one who comes out, It is the salt without freshness, so let us be your Lord, that is, his peace for our sake of your prayers is that he will come out to us such and such, and the loyalty of the captivity of the goodness of the good (Call) by breaking the eye, making a call from the dh of the ya, but they asked Moses to pray to them because the supplication of the prophet is upon them the prayer and peace be upon them.On that the supplication of others is absolutely absolutely close to it, so what you thought is the supplication of the prophets for their nations, and for this, “He said ﷺ (p-274) to the life of God, may God be pleased with him Your prayers), “And in the effect:” (Call me for the year, you did not disobey me in it), and I was pregnant with the Sunnah of others, and the exposure of the grapes of the profitable, and he said: And they did not say: Our Lord, because there is a disobedience to him with what is not in his needs, his choice, and his affliction, as if they said: Call us Well to you

satellite is a word from the word (what), so the difference is a suspended linguist (with an output), and on the two estimates, as he said that the salvation said, Some of these are delayed, and if he was made a biar, he would not have said (from) Al -Tabadiya, as the one said by Issam al -Din: The words of the redemption said that the one who is mentioned, A whole delay of these are the enemy of

understanding of the denial, and the overestimation of the white, (P-275).With it, I answer that their saying: We will not be patient, as it is indicated by the food of that food, and the number of thank you for the grace is the same as the disappearance, so that they are asking for it, and they are asking for it.They asked for that, and their speech with this is a sign that he is up to them if he gave them what they asked, preventing them from those who and peace be upon them, so they do not gather, and it was said: the one who is in the past, and it is the same, and it is the same, (Do you change), and it is metaphor, because the disturbance is not for them, but that is to God Almighty, but they were when they were the same as their question, and they have made them.Take the one who is etc., who is the act of you, and it is the one who has the arrival, and the one who entered upon it is the Zael, and it is (the lowest) of the (who is), which is here, and it is the most important

best of the good and the peace, and the meaning of the best of this is the eaten of the lineage to that, the exaggeration of its values, The generation is in his ethnicity, and the number of costs in

earth God has written for you for the obligatory prayer, as it is indicated by the end of the forbidden, and that is required to prevent the entry of another land, and that the matter will be the matter of What is between the house of the sanctuary to Qananin, and from the people who made Egypt the Arabs of Marshaim, as a family, a name for one of the children of the Prophet, who is the one

from the hand, and they are from the hand, and they are from the hand The purification of the lobby to know that they are exhausted, and do not confuse the Muslims, and what they were pushed on the poverty of the soul and its scarcity, so do not see a religion from the mortality It is for him to disturb the situation, fearing that the part Until this is what you see in the Jews today, and this warning is a reward for them for the infidels of that grace, and this is the reason for the verse before it, but it is the same, but it is the same That is a return to all the Jews, and the inclusion of those who address the words of the Almighty: For you have what you have asked and whoever comes after them to the day of the resurrection, then it is not from the day of the ritual They have been angry with God, that is, they have come down and enabled what they have been in the calamity and erectness in the world, or by what is achieved for them from the torment in the heart, or with what is for the sake of the heart, or by what is In them, or they returned with anger, that is, they have become on them, and therefore it was not invoked to the adoption of the recovery to him, or they became a right to it, or they fulfilled the torment, and it is the same By opening, and guaranteeing, equality of the parts, then it is used in every equality, so it is said: He is the Bawat al -Falal, that is, its efficiency, and from it, for the sake of the nickname of the whole, His location is from the fire), and in the description of the anger in his being from God, the Almighty is a greatness for his affliction after a greatness, and a fool after a fool.That is that they were atonement for the verses of God and killing the prophets, without the truth, indicated with that to what was preceded by the confusion of humiliation and the righteous, and the wickedness, but the wickedness, but the wickedness, After one, even if it was a sign of the goodness, it was not the reason for the distant or the indication that they realized these matters with them with their distance from them.The people of the book, or to gesture to its distance in the horror, and the cosmate for the reason, which is within the interpreted source, and it was not crossed by it, and crossed what it crosses it.The disbelief, and the killing of them, then after,, and their receptors for them while it is going, or to bring them to the sacrifice of their artifacts, and the verses are either the miracles, or it is divorced.Moses, peace be upon him, or what he brought from and other than the verses of the books that are divorced, or the converge He, peace and blessings be upon him, in which the pod is, or the Qur’an, and in the addition of the verses to his name, the exaggeration of the increase Great, and his extension of their killing of the prophets because it is like his eclipse of him, and he brought the prophets who appear in the few without the prophets who appeared in the abundance of the abundance, if there is a lot of people.Two denunciations, but if they entered them (Al), and they are equal, as in the sea, then it is not possible that they killed the praise of a prophet in the first day, and they were in the first day, and they were in the first day The killing, without the right, is that the killing of the Prophet is only so, because of the time that this is the right of the right to them, as there is no one who is one of them.Peace be upon them, but he carried them a love The world and the followers of the passion, and the glory in the disobedience, and the fenders, the blame in the right is for this for the covenant, and it was said: The appearance is that it is for the Sen, and what is meant is the right of the right The vague is like the den for it, and it is supported by what is in the family of Amran (without the right), so it is beneficial that it was not truly a certainty of their criticism as well The standards of their makers, for he was killed by the Prophet, then a group of them, and then he is the right of the truth, and this is worsened by what is the back of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The matter (P-277) is a right to the killer, or not, except that the restrictions on killing, without the right, have a lineage to the disease in what they are in what they are, and what is said about what they are in.To be said: If he had not been restricted by the right, he would not have said that one of the properties of the prophecy is that if he had killed one of the right, he would not be fulfilled, so the benefit Because the partial judgment is distant as it is not hidden, some of those who are late said: This is all if it is others in the sense of negation, that is, without the truth, but if it is with any For the truth, that is, falsehood, the piety is useful because the prophets were killed by the cause of falsehood, and its rocks, and the close of this is what the lock said: from that they were: Their miracles are voted, and they kill them with this reason, and that they want to invalidate the right they have to do with their rule, and that is the most of them And Zakari lives upon them, peace be upon them.Some of them, peace be upon him, and they wanted them, and killed him, and saluted peace be upon him, but he was killed for a story of that woman, and God cursed it His son was killed, and he was sacrificed, so he sent the king in his request anger because he obtained his wife from killing his son, and he found in the woven of the tree, so they fell in the wow of the tree.With him, he met a length of time with a saw, and then the back is that the neighbor and the mourning of what the disbelievers and killing were disputed, and in the sea that it is attached to what is attached to what is, and it is a matter Between this verse, and what is like it, and the words of the Almighty: We will support our messengers contradict, and it is answered that the murderers are from the prophets, and the mourning is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the Prophet His saying: Worse, a messenger comes to you to his saying, his grace: a separation, you lied and a partner who kills, indicating that the murdered is a messenger, and he was also a messenger, and he answered.The victory is the prevalence of the pilgrimage, or the taking of revenge, as it was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them.Thirty and thirty -year -olds, and does not hide In it, it is good that what is meant by the messengers who are commanded to fight, as he answered some of the investigators, because their command is to fight and the soul of the soul of the people The wise, and read on the authority of God, may God bless him: (they kill) with tightening, and goodness in a narration from him (and kill) with the vain, so that you will be from you.With the prodigy of the prophets, as well as the Prophet and the Prophet, and formed what was narrated, “A man said to the Prophet ﷺ: (O Prophet of God), with the prodigy, and he said: (But the Prophet of God), without a prodigy, “So he denied that, and this is prohibited from each other from his release On two prophets, and he is an effective in the sense of an effective, and they were stated that he does not collect a gathering of a negative remembrance, and it is answered from the first that Abu Zayd said from the one who said: It was forbidden to deliver that it is with it, O Lord of God, the Exalted, so it is for that for that to be deluded, and it is not necessary from the health of the Lord of God, may God bless him and grant him peace He who acquired it from every lack of his permissibility from human beings, and it was said: The forbidden was special in the chest He said (Look), and on the authority of the second that it is not a compatibility on it, as it was said: It is in the sense of an actor, and if he was a ladder, then he did not come out, and he did not come out of this He calls him whoever does not know that, so he corrected his collection by adopting the meaning that prevails over him, so he managed.That is what they disobeyed, and they used to refer to the infidels and the exact killing of what was presented, and the reference was permissible with the individual to the multiplicity of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same A single person who is a single memorial, and it may be done like that in the guerrilla, carrying it, and the B for the caus.With the verses of God, the Expatriate killing them is the presenter of their disobedience, their accommodation, and their equivalents, the guilt, and the guilt runs the sin, and the guilt of the first Recalling the disagreement of the divorce of the disobedience, and it was said: The Ba in the meaning of it, and it was said: Referring to that is what was referred to to it with the first, and the emotion is left to the emotion (P-27) From them, she is independent in the investigation of the warning, so how if they are gathered, and this face is weakened by the fact that the rhythm is the disagreement of the original with the absence It appears at the time of the revenue of the word that is increased, as the appearance of what they disobeyed, etc.They did not satisfy the judiciary, and they did not thank the blindness, and they did not patience with the light, how was it beaten upon them The tyrants before the existence of the universes, and their abundance with the dwelling of the dwelling in the reasoning of the mullahs, and the wearing of their hearts is the love of the world, and the looting of them.* * * And from the chapter of the one -food, the one is the spiritual food from the rule and the knowledge, and what the land is alerted is the lustful desires, the imperfect pleasures, and the flaws of the righteousness of the righteousness The souls that are humiliated in Egypt, which are obligatory for humiliation for those who tasted it, and the dwelling of those who have it, and the halk of those who are upset and the reason for the request of this And its evacuation, and the altercation of the hearts with the bowl of sins, and cut it with a piece of cutting and returning it, and which runs to this ignorance of the loved ones, and the one who is the one Required, we ask God Almighty to us and you, the well -being,
