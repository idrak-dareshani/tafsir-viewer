The researcher, the Qur’an, worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship, nor I worship what you worshiped, nor do you worship what I worship, I want to be in it, for the righteousness of the ritual There is no affirmation of the first on the one who is the one who is the most affirmative, and the four are sure of the second, and it is the one who is the good and the one who gave it to him) We descended the language of the Arabs and from their habit of the righteous words of confirmation and understanding, and the respondent says: Yes.And the obedient: No, no.And upon him the saying of the Exalted: No, you know, and then they know that you know, and his saying was sought: And his saying: ؎ We are disturbed by the weapon between me, how much is how much and how much is a distraction for me to be foolish and say: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ Increased and prose, and the most affirmation is the cut of the infidels and the achievement that they are ever on the infidels.It was assumed that the assertion of the sentence is not with the emotion except by then, as if the saying in that was the wow, then, and then it appears that the one who said the confirmation made the sentence of the ritual.The third, and made the group to be given to the group of the two first sentences.From the one who is the one who has been kind to him, he does not want what was mentioned, and that is the meaning of the first part of the second part of the second part of the first part of the first and the first part of the first and the first part From the second of the second part of the first, otherwise he shows what is in the sea, which is hardly permissible as it is not hidden, and the one who has the jam is that they do not have the same Al -Zamakhshari: (I do not worship) I want the denial of worship as it is accepted; Because "no" does not enter except on the one in the sense of the future, as what is not entered except on a harms in the sense of the situation, and the meaning: I do not do in the future, what is required of me from me Your God, nor do you do in it what I ask of you from the worship of my God, and I was not worship In the last sentence, the negation of the negation and that he carried the harms in it on the benefit of the recipients and the deposit, and in the second, the nose is used for the past.Al -Tayyibi said: He made the two centuries to the two for the two for the one who is upright and the other two for the past, and it was assumed to him that the two of the people are not, and what is the one who is not.He feels that the words of Sibuyeh.Al -Khafaji said: What is mentioned is my most or a restriction of the prominent of the century based on what it violates, or is it a whole and there is no stone in the permissibility and the bearing on the other hand.The renovation is here, and it was said that the expression of the saying of the saying of the story in the first worshiper and the numbness of the fierceness of it in the second; Because the installation of it for the problems and it was said: the first two villages are for the righteousness as it passed, and the others are for the situation and its choice is the father of Hayyan My servant is my servants.It was said by the opposite, and the words of the gospel and the elderly of the Sunnah.It was said: The priority of the past and the other for the one who is accepted by Ibn Katheer from the story of Al -Bukhari and others, and we also transfer from the sheikh of Islam, Glory be to him: I do not worship what you worship the deeds of the verb because it is an actual sentence, and with his words, the Almighty: I do not worship what you have worshiped, the exile of the Lord of God.That is in the college; Because the negation of the fatal sentence is confirmed, as it was the deeds of the verb, and its universe on him, peace and blessings be upon him.In the testimony of the nomadic sentence, it is not possible to say: Under this concept is divorced (P-252), it is not exposed to adultery, as if it was said: I am from whom he does not believe in this concept in the first place, and you are not.The concept is arranged.It was said: The priority is to the exile of the advertisement that the disbelievers mentioned, and the other for the negation of the general; That is: I do not worship what you worship, please worship God Almighty, nor do you worship, please worship your idol.Then it was said: I am not a worshiper of your kindness for the supply of purposes with the face of the face The predecessor is "who" because what is meant is the row, as if it was said: What is worshiped from the great servants who are unable On the first of the idols, it is launching in its sorrow, it was released on the servants with a right to the problems, and whoever says: “What” may fall on ““ He needs what was mentioned, and Abu Muslim said: “What” in the two first in the sense of which he is effective, and the one who is slave is the idol; That is: I do not worship idols and do not worship God Almighty.And in the last two export; That is: nor I am a worshiper like your worshiped worshipers on suspicion, and if you want you, you said: On the blessing that is out of it, it is a worship of worship, and you are not worshiped The builder is on the one, and if you want you, you said: on the neutrality and the salvation, and on it it is not a crime as well.Some of the deadlines said in this place: His saying is up to the Almighty: I do not worship what you worship and his saying is his grace: nor do I worship what you worshiped either Both of them denied the situation or both of them denied the receipt, or one of them for the condition and the other for the future, and on the quadruples, he memorized what is either the source Included, or described in them, or a source in one of them and a connection, or a supporter in the other, and these are six models that have three.And it did not stop the division of the image of the difference between the difference between the first and the last, nor to the difference between the connection and the Sufism to multiply the sections; Because the images of the difference are equal to the payment of the ribs, and the supporter of the connection and the chapter is closely They worship what I worship) in Al -Mawadidin, and it is known that there is no renovation in the image of the difference, whether by adopting the situation and the arrests, or by administering what is in the case Mawsoufa and in the other, and the exile of their worshipers in the event that the worshipers have to be pray The ritual ritual, and made it a source of vastness, as it was said: ؎ If your friend is clear from those who are used to me, then you have lost your nations and the words were cut off, and from here he said some of the virtues of the virginity in the time It is imbued that what is meant is from his saying: I do not worship what you worship the exile of the worship of idols, and from the words of the Almighty: You are not worshiping what you worship An other thing to be exposed to something else, and when they thought that they would say to a neglect of what is meant or like it: How do you justify you to deny what we want to do with you He worshiped and we also worship God Almighty, the end of what is in the door that we worship with him otherwise, I add to that with his saying that I am not worshiped by what I worshiped They worshiped God, but they worshiped something that they said that He is God, and God is glorified and exalted behind that; That is: nor I am worshiped at the time of the gods of God who worshiped; Because you worshiped something that you imagined and that with the title of what you imagined is not the god who worshiped him, nor do you worship in the time of what I am on the time of what I am on Because I worshiped the described God with the adjectives that the Bethls rose up that they are the attributes of God.The matter of the matter is known from it, as it is not presented to the expressions of the "infidels" without the partners ", as if it was not given the two villages of the two of the two.They are about the two others, because they woke up with their answer with that this is the most important thing for them, so do not be afraid.Among the people who choose to be what is in the two first centuries, it is an effective one for what he accepted, and it is intended for the first of the gods and the second of God, and the second of God, The worship of the worship is noticed with it (P-253).It is the intended and the surrounding view, as it requires that and the two Qur'an As he agreed with the answer as well, and it has been completed by them, as it was said: I do not worship in the future, what you worshiped immediately from the gods; any; This does not happen as you ask of me and call me to him, nor do you worship in the future, what I worship in the case, and what they are in the other two, and what is in the other two After it with a source, it was made, divorced, as before, as the father of a Muslim did, so that the words are included in the state of worship in the state of worship, from the same With the user, even if you do not deviate from it in the occurrence, the reference to the state of its condition with the notice of its attachment to the effective, and the receptor of the negation is intended in the nose in the nose in the nose in the nose in the same Fear against them, nor are they grieving, and in that from their scourge, what is not in the restriction of what the answer was done, as if it was said: I am not worshiped on the one who is the servant You have been gone with your life; Because my worshipers are aware of it and your worship is from it, and you are not worshiping the sake of worship like my worship that I am a continued; Because you are the ones who have been glorified by God, and they have been disturbed by their hearts, and I am the beloved, the right of the truth, so you are still in worship of it, and I am still in it, and I am still in it.The difference between the two worshipers is considered to be in other directions, and the recipient is replaced in “what is worshiped”.The enemy in the second to that is because the types of his worship, peace and blessings be upon him, were not complete after that, but rather they were renewed for them for other types of time The renewal of referring to the truth of all what God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, brings to him.Al -Zamakhshari said: He did not say: I did not worship as it was said what you worshiped; Because they worshiped idols before the mission, and he was upon him the prayer and peace, and God did not worship in that time, and it is followed by that, and it is not the same.And peace was spent in the cave of Harak before the Baath.And the father of Al -Wafi stipulated on the son of Aqeel on the authority that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was a period of time before his mission, with what he is correct for him, that he is from the authority of the Prophet, Al -Baath, and the son of Al -Jawzi said in the book Al -Wafi: It contains two narratives on the authority of the Imam Ahmad; One of them: He was worshiped by what was correct from the partners of those before him with the way of the revelation, not from their faces, and we did not move them, nor do they write them, He said the companions of Abu Hanifa, the second: that he was not worshiped except for what [Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
