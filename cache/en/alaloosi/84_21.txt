The Qur’an, if the Qur’an is read to them, they do not prostrate to their kindness on the current sentence; It is the same.That is, what is forbidden to them if they are prostrating with the Qur’an, and the prostration is metaphor for the inconvenience that is not for him on what was narrated from the one.And in the Qur’an with faith is a sign of greatness as it is not hidden, or it is on its appearance.What is meant by what is before: the recipient of the Qur’an, or in which there is a prostitute.And may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him that he was prostrated at the readings of this verse.A Muslim, Abu Dawood, and Al -Tirmidhi and Al -Nasa’i, and the son of Majah and others are narrated from Abu Hurairah, who said: “We found with the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace And read in the name of your Lord." And the sheikh, Abu Dawood and Al -Nasa’i, and on the authority of my father, were brought up, he said: “ My father, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, succeeded him, so he will still be prostrated in it until he met him, peace and blessings be upon him.In that, a response to Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, when he said: He is not in the separation, and he is from the wall of Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and he is said: The most of the stone is a prostration, which is a year at the Shafi’i, and a duty of Abu Hanifa.The Imam said: It was narrated, “He, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, read the same day.This verse was revealed." And Abu Hanifa embarked on the path of prostration with this from two sides: (P-84) is the first that his action is upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.The exaggeration of the one who hears it and does not prostrate, and the crops of the slander at the blessing indicate that it is ended.And there is a search with the fact that the hadith was as Ibn Hajar said that it was not proven.
