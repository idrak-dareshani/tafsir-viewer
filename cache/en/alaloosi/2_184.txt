The Quranic researcher is numbers, that is: appointed or few; Because the little is its enemy, it is considered, and the many are taken.A fighter said: All (numbers) in the Qur’an or (numbers) without the four, and that is not said to what has increased, and what is meant by these days is either Ramadan, and the abundance Muslim - may God be pleased with him - and the most investigators, and he is one of the words of Al -Shafi’i, so God will be - Glory be to Him - and he has informed us of the first Show him with his saying, Azza and Galleh: days of numbers, so some of the dignity, then he explained it with his saying - is a pride from the saying -: the month of Ramadan is a long time That if the meantic was that the male of the sick and the traveler was a crime, and it was answered that he was in the fast in the fast of Ramadan, and it is obligatory for the sake We copy the choice, and it became a duty of the concern, it was a matter of being deluded that this judgment is all until the sick and the traveler will be like the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the person Holding them, alerting it that their summary is the rest of it, and it was not changed as the ruling of the resident and the correctness changed, and it is not necessary for it.From every month, which is the days of white, on what was narrated from a gift, and was attributed to Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with him - or three of every month, and on the day of Ashura, on the authority of Ashura The people of this saying that this duty has been copied with the fast of Ramadan, and it was formed that his satisfaction is, but it was proven in what is in this verse, then if it is a work, then if it is a work, then if it is a work A dedicated period - as it was said to him - how is the copyist to be connected, and if he did not work with it, the copy is not valid; As we do not copy before the work, and it is answered, either at the first selection, because contact in recitation does not indicate communication in the descent, and on the selection of the second, the second is the one who is the second Before the work, he managed.And he (days) is not fasting as it was said to the chapter on the chapter between them with a foreigner, but rather with a guarantee, it is upon him - it means fasting - Extension, and it was said: a tendency that is sufficient to liken it, and in it there is a way for the same way, as it was said: He wrote to you from fasting for you from the fast.Koen (numbers), meaning: the similarity is located between the two fasting from this direction, and it is attached to each of them with a period of time, so it is a long time.Jurisprudence, and it was said: We are based on that it is a second effective for books on expansion, and his response in the sea is that the breadth is based on the pornography and the fell of its part It is valid; Because the custodian is the subject of the verb, and the writing is not located in the days, but the location is in it.It is fasting, and it is answered that it is sufficient for the custody of the attachment, as in (he knows what is in the heavens and the earth) and that the meaning of (books) is a pleasure, and the pleasure of fasting, Days, whoever is a sick person who is sick with him the fast with him, as he gave permission from him, his saying is up to him, after: God wants you, and he does not want you and does not want you The jurisprudence, and the son of Sirin, Ata and Al-Bukhari went until the license is divorced (P-58), the illness of the release of the memorizer, and it was reported that they entered on the authority of Sir.He eats, and he will be used to the pain of his sake, and it is a saying to the philosophy.Or on a travel: or a passenger who is traveled to him, who is able to do it, that he was able to work with him before the dawn, so he has a gesture until he who traveled in the rituals of God, and he did not.I was on (traveling), and he was inferred by launching the travel on the fact that the short and the travel of disobedience is licensed to breakfast, and the most knowledgeable of the scholars is what is permissible in the way Mostly, it is traveling to the distance destined on the law.A number of days more, that is: the fast of the days of the sick and the travel from other days if it breaks, and the condition and the two added to the knowledge of the condition, then the condition of the knowledge of the condition, And the traveler is inside the public discourse, so he referred to the fast of fasting on them, so if the judgment would not restrict here to him, he would not have to become the sick and the one who is the one who is the one Urban and mind who are obligatory for the hardship, and the first added, because the words are in fasting and his duty, and the second is because it was said: (Whoever is satisfied or not) Multiple days, and it is a matter that is from the last days, it is noteworthy that what is meant is numbers with the number of days of the disease and the travel, and I seek to add to the addition, and this is the fast, and this is a break of the fast Summary, the sick and the traveler, if they want a fast, and if they want to break the fast, as the most of the jurisprudence has, except that the Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik said: The fasting is the love of the one who loves and said: Fair loves, and the phenomenon of the phenomenon is the path of breakfast, and that if a fast is not valid for their fast; Because it was before the time that the verse appears, and this is attributed to Ibn Abbas and Ibn Umar and Abu Hurairah and a group of the companions - may God be pleased with them - And they prolonged the reference to what it narrated about the people of the house, and it is inferred by the verse on the permissibility of the judiciary, followed and separated, and that it is not for the sake Ramadan was involved all of the Ramadan (numbers), and if it was complete, it would not have been rewarded by a short or incomplete month.Whoever said: There is no ransom with the judiciary, and so whoever said: The traveling person, if he stays and the sick, if he heal during the day of the day, did not They are obligated to hold it.Because God - exalted - is only a number of days, and they have been broken, and the ruling of breakfast remains for them, and it is ruling that there is no more than one day, and the day of the day.The judiciary is for us to do more than the day, and it does not hide what is in it, and read (exclusively) by setting on the fact that it is an act of a deleted; That is, let him finish a number, and whoever estimates the condition is there, it is estimated here, and on those who are restricting it, that is: and on those who are fasting to fast, if they break it, then give it.Food of poor people is the amount of what every day eats, and it is half a saa of righteousness or a saa other Islam, when the fasting was imposed on them, and they were not used to him, so he was accustomed to them.And Al -Tarshidi, Al -Nasa’i, Al -Tabrani, and others, “On the authority of Salamah ibn al -Aka’a - may God be pleased with him - he said: When this verse came down, and those who are among those who are among those who are from the one who will be among those who are.He breaks out, and the action of that is fulfilled until the verse, which was after it, has come down, so whoever has witnessed from you the month, let him fast it.By adding the first ya and tightening the second ya, and a jurisdiction and a generosity: (they are hungry) by tightening the Ta` and the second water, and the two readers are on the authority The origin of them: (they stand it) (and you will stop it) to do and do, not from the act and do it, otherwise it would be with the wow without the yaa; Because he was a loyalty, and he was wow, and the wow was made in them, and then the ya was tickled in the ya, and it is with me (they are all of them), and Aisha - may God be pleased with it) With the form of the one who is active from the activity; That is, they cost him or imitate him from the tower in the sense of energy or hearts, and the three (P -59) narrated from Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with him - In the sense that they cost it or imitate it and tighten it - by slurring the Ta’a in the Ta'a - and went to the numbers of the copy, as the Bukhari narrated it, and Abu Dawah said: It was descended in the old sheikh, the old man, and the old man.Among the people who did not say the transcription also on the frequent readings, and interpreted it (they fast their efforts and their energy), and it is based on that (the one) The thing is on the face of the ease, (and the energy) is a name for the ability with the severity and the hardship, so the meaning becomes: (And on those who) they fast with the severity, and the severity, and the severity, and the severity, and the severity, We are also the doors and the breastfeeding woman, and on the authority of the verb, he reached the end of his lords or emptied his lords in it, and it is permissible to be (the ham His energy That he wrapped his soul, so his energy was ran out when he was complete, and he was exaggerated in the vigor of the defendant; Because it is a burden of the states of that - as in the revelation - and the truth that each of the readings can be carried on what the copies bear, and what it does not need, and for each Hafsa that she read: (And on those who do not tolerate him), and a sofa and Ibn Amir read with an addition (ransom) to (food), and gathering (the poor), and the addition of the one to the time His genesis as a silver horse; Because the food of the poor is a ransom and others, and the plural of the poor; Because he gathered in and on those who are tolerated by him, he met with collection, and he did not collect a ransom; Because it is a source, and it is in it to be grateful, not for the time, and because it was not added to a collection, so it is understood from the collection.So whoever volunteers is better than that he increased the amount mentioned in (Al -Fadiya), Mujahid said: Or he increased the number of those who are obligated by his food, and he will be fed up, and he will be blessed.Abbas, or collected between food and fasting, Ibn Shihab said.It is the best for him, that is: the voluntary or the good that it vows, and made some of them the first one, the source of the source of you So the bearing is also beneficial without a bitterness, and the return of the guilt to (who), meaning: the one who is used is better than other than it for the sake of the voluntary, and it is not hidden after it The healthy residents, or those who are tired of the fragrance and the wonders, or those who are diagnosed with breakfast from the two sects, the satisfaction and the travelers, and in which the tafs are from the absence to the absence to the absence to the absence For the feet of fasting with the speaker, and read the father: (and fasting).It is better for you from the ransom or the virginity of goodness on the first, or from them and from the delay in the elimination of the last, if you know, 184, from the rituals of the rituals, Deleted by a confidence in its appearance; That is, you chose it, and it was said: It is with it if you are among the people of science, you know that the fast is better for you from that, and on it the sentence will be a certainty, and the good is for the good.
