on their acceptance of the truth, and the meaning that they have not left before you for a similarity that you pay with an argument, but they are immortalized for the sake of the stubbornness, It is from commenting on the condition of the condition of their follow -up to the most vulnerable to the one who has a face and asserted it that the meaning is that they do not follow you in the first place - and if it comes to all - if it comes to all - if it comes to all How do they judge that they are not followed, and a group of them believed, and he took advantage of the saying that this is in the people who are special, or the ruling on the whole, and the ruling on the whole, He was used for him, and adding the kiss to his guerrilla -may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -; Because God Almighty worshiped Him with her exclusion and what you are at the authority of their kisses, that is, that is not that of you, and it is referred to be, for the sentence is an expert, and it is not good.The truth of the matter of the kiss is all affirming, and cut off the people of the book, so they said: O Muhammad, return to our kisses and we believe in you Excellency -and in it indicates that this kiss does not ever make a texture, and it was said: It is a experience of constructive memory, and the forbidden means; That is, do not follow their kisses, that is,: Do not follow it, and the kissing is unique, even if it is a dignity; For Jews before and Christians before; Because they bought two void, so the two became one of the heroes, and that is good.Because before him, they did not follow your kisses and it was said: The individuals are based on that the kissing of the two sectors is the right to the house of the place The honesty was raised, but it was before it before the children of the children of the day, then after raising it, the skewers of the Christians were to the sake of the evil The Christ - peace be upon him - was delegated to them, analysis, prohibition, and law of rulings, and that what is They analyzed him and forbade him, so he analyzed him and deprived him of the sky, and they mentioned to them that in the honesty, secrets are not other than him, and for this he was the birth of the His Excellency said: As she was rejected by her family, a honest place, and the Christ was accepted when he crucified - with their grace - the east, and it was said: Jesus - peace and blessings be upon him - and he said to me: “The sun has a cry, I love him, he informs my peace on every day, so my people pass to go to them, so they will go to them, so they will go to them.And they did, “and it supports that that it is not in the yearning for the honesty, and the son of the values ​​went until the kissing of the two sectors is now that it is not a kiss and the kiss of the - Excellency - but with a taska and drew from them, but the Christians worked hard, and they made the honesty before, and Jesus was before the raising, praying to the rock, and for the sake of the shack With them, if they come out and if they came to the sanctuary of the sanctuary, they set it into the rock and prayed to it, and when it was raised, they worked, and they led to the prayer to the prayer, and it is in the prayer.The one is the matter of that, and the Samara of them prayed to their phase with the Levant.Each project is specialized with a kiss and a manner.Then, this sentence is more informed in the negation of the first sentence of its faces: it is nominal, and the name is repeated in it two times, and it is a certainty of it, and it is for you.Take care of what was presented and some of them with a follow -up before each other Al -Nasraniya, and in that way to crucify them in the passion and their stubbornness, by that this is the violation and the stubbornness does not conclude with you, but rather in what is between them, and what is the same, and the whole of them is also It is presented, confirmed by the command of the kiss in the way that their denials are arising from the excess of stubbornness and a question for the Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - On the path of imposition, otherwise there is no meaning for the use of (the), the impulsive of the insured, after the fulfillment is achieved, as it is before, and the one is the same To follow the passion, and the remembrance of its ugliness, without the view of the follow -up and the follower.After what came to you from the knowledge, that is: the knowledgeable who revealed to you the cows of the chain of transmission to it, and what is meant after that is the truth that you are the one who is the oppressor: The obscenity, and this sentence is also a report of the command (the kiss) and in it is a face of affirmation and the vigor, which is the oath, and the endowment of it, and (the) Checking, (lam) is in its bias, and the definition of the oppressors, And the divine sentence, and (so) is the penalty, and the altruism (from the unjust) on (unjust) -
