The researcher, when he drew Moses for his people, reminds of a great blessing, as they disbelieved, and that was in the time when they thirsty, in (P-270) some effects that they said: Shams?So the gambling, and they said: Who have the food?So God Almighty has revealed to them the Mins and the Salwa, and they said: Who do we have with water?Moses was tired of stinging the stone, and changing the arrangement to the intention of the highness of each of the many things in the exposure of an independent matter, and it is necessary to remember, and the remembrance, and the remembrance, and the remembrance, and the remembrance of the The perishing pillar is the understanding that every matter is one, a matter of its remembrance, and the restoration is the request of watering when the water of the water, or its sayings, said: His Lord, or water, and this action in the eloquence has been transgressing to the one who is a tire of it, and to the one who is one, as it is in the words of the Almighty: as it was hardened by the people of the people: ؎ And the darkening of the darkening of the face of the yarm, a grace for the worse, and its transgression to them, as well The words of the Arabs, and the imam is related to the act, and it is a captive, that is, for the sake of its people, so we said we are stirred with the stones of the stone, that is, we answered it, so we said, It is roll from Wow, with a spoiler, and his disobedience, that is, I struck him with a stick, and he is collected on the verb of anomalies, and on the verbs of measules, and he said: The eye is the movement of the holy, and the stone is this well -known body, and its gathering is a carpentry and a carpentry and said: a carpentry, and they missed from it and said: The stones of the clay, and the eagerness of the mud, What is meant by this stick is responsible for it in his words, the Almighty: What is your right, Moses, and the famous that it is from the head of paradise, its length is the same Two peoples who are imitated in darkness, inherited by a jungle from Kabir, until they reached a people, and from it to Moses, peace be upon them, and it was said: He raised it in it.What is meant by the stone is a dispute, so the good said: It was not a specific stone, but rather any stone that was stripped of the water from it, and this is the most exaggerated in the miracle, and the father said: They have a stone, so they breathed, and on this lame in it for the tongue, and it was said: for the covenant, and it is a specific stone that he carried with him from the phase of the cubic Every face is three eyes, for every precursor to a hand in a grandfather to the ritual that was commanded to be watered, and they would be the fulfillment of a thousand people, and they will be a thousand people Twenty miles, and it was said: A stone was at Adam, he arrived with the stick to a people, and he was pushed to Moses, and it was said: It is the stone that flew with his garment, It was taken from the soup of the sea light that the head of the Adami, he put it in his creatures, if he needed the water of his beating, and the narratives in that many, And the appearance of the most opposite, and it does not build on the appointment of this stone is a religious matter, and the Islam is the convergence of its knowledge to God Almighty.Twenty people exploded from it, a kind of compassion, that is, he was struck and closed, and it is indicated by this deleted and the exhaustion, and if it was not the argument, and if it was a scandal, and if it was a scandal The matter had a good thing, and some of them called this eloquent fulfillment, and it is estimated to be a condition, meaning that if you are beaten, then it has exploded, and in the sense that this is the restriction.Exaggeration is at righteousness, unless it is said: What is meant is that we have risen with the arrangement of the exaggeration on your beating It is estimated after fulfillment, as it is the measure after the matter when the captain is intended, and the installation is from before: Let the warning be from you, for the immigration, and it is not hidden in all (P-271) until he said, “Our children are the databases of the Roman residence in the first: that it is not appropriate for the sake Farewell and command, and the immigration is the creativity of something, and it is the dawn, and the immorality, and here it was exploded, and in the naughty, it was burst The first is the first to marry water, the width is its expansion and its many, or the pulsea, its exit from the crucifix One, and on the satisfaction of the seductive, does not oppose the disagreement of the conditions, and from the end of the end, and the guarantee is a good at the wound, and its return to the ritual and the one who does not Advancement is upon him, and the time is in the two toothpicks, and it is said: Thanta, except that the ritual in it is on the sea of ​​the tooth, and this is a counterpart, and it is a wel.Because it is from the second, and he read Mujahid and a group, and Al -Saadi narrated it from Abu Omar (ten) by breaking the sheen, and it is the language of the children Attiyah: It is a weak language, and some of the grammarians stipulated, and it is understood from some of those who are late.It helps it, and the eye is the water of the water, and it is gathered on the eyes of anomalies, and the eyes of measurement, and they said in the supervision of the people: Annia, and that came in the insight a little, as it is in its saying: It is a tendency to distinguish, and its individuality is like this position, and the volume was permissible to be a collection, and this number was without otherwise for them to be the same.Separation, and among them was disturbing and competitiveness, so God Almighty went to every precursor to his response, which he does not share with him one of the other causes of the pace of the ritual The ruling on the arrest is the saying of the Almighty: all people have known their drink, which is a ritual sentence that is a concept that is all of them.A drink that knows him, so he does not exceed the drink other than him, and people who are not one of him from his memorial With her right, it is clear, and it is an infection here, and it was done.Mimi in the sense of drinking, and carrying it with them on the drink, which is water, and his pregnancy is at the place, first when Abu Hayyan, and the addition of the drink to them, is that it is not for them to be He specialized in it, as if it was a king of them, and he returned the destiny in their drink in the sense (every), and it is not permissible to return to its memorization, because it is not the same, because it is a good thing to me.The meaning, as it is in its words, is the Almighty: the day we call all people with their imam and its saying: ؎ All people will enter between them ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ Alert it to the great benefit that is the reason for life, and if the narration of the words is required, all people know their eyes, and in the words, it is omitted, that is, from it, that is, that is, that is, that is For a twelve ethnic, there must be a tie, but he described it with it, because it is a miracle other, where it happens with the water of the water, it is not possible.Another, and it is necessary for the sentence to be a state, not a characteristic of the saying of the Almighty: Twenty -two, so that he does not need the ability of the good, and to help the knowledge of the knowledge Ling, and the drink, then the eye, eat and drink from the sustenance of God on the will of the saying, and began to eat because the body of the body is with it, and the need is from it.To show the end, and it is necessary to be for the metabolism, and in the remembrance of the sustenance, an additional added to the nation, and a reference to the obtaining of that for them, other than that, and no one who is tired, and in this I came, then we said, and if it was running on one system, he said: From our livelihood, and if he made the guarantee before they were, they were supported to Moses, that is, and he said: And the sustenance is here in the sense of the custodian, which is the food that is presented from the good and the liquid, and the drink is from the water (P-272) the eyes, and it was said: What is meant by the water is that it is the water, because it is the water, because it is the one, because it is the one who is.It is an alert from it, and it weakens it that it was not in the end of the time of that water as it indicates to it the saying of the Almighty: One is obligatory for him, too On the authority of it, or the saying with the deletion of one of the two verbs, that is, they are both of the sustenance of God, and they were buried from the sustenance of God, and the saying of some of the delayed: The verse is a sign of another miracle, which is that this water is as The thirst is narrated, so it is a food, so it is a food and a distance after the end of the distance, and it is close to it that they are not all of them, and they will be rewarded with the ability It makes an order that arranged for their remembrance of what the time to seek the face of thanksgiving and remembrance of the ability of God Almighty, so it is the one who addresses the one who is the one who is the one who addressed this And their drinking, from what God bless them, and the bond of corruption is to deliver creation and collect the presentation of the world, and it will be his separation from what he preceded, because it is the same, because it is the same, because it is the same A result of the male, and the disgraceful of this verse was brought up that the sustenance is the halal, because the least trades of this matter are that it is for the porn, so it is permissible.If there was a forbidden sustenance, the livelihood would be permissible and forbidden, and that it is not permissible, and the answer is that the sustenance here is not a lame, if I want from the one who is the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, and the water, It is obligatory from a certain sweetener of the kind of sustenance By eating and drinking from the livelihood of God, the exalted, and that is not restricted to them with a time, no place, no place, and no place, that was a grace and goodness to them.The eaters and the drink, they are forbidden by what can arise from that, and it is corruption until they do not meet those blessings with disbelief, and the mutilation is some of the two who are not.Corruption was or not, so it is like a feud, then he was overwhelmed in corruption, (and spoilers) on this condition, and it is not confirmed, and it is the origin in it, as it is indicated by the one who is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same.Corruption, and the situation is certain, and in which the certainty of the affirmative situation after the actual actual is the difference of the gathering, and the time is gone, and the time is not the same In corruption, the state of your corruption, and the end of the intention of what they have to do with corruption, and it is from the Aslub: Do not eat usury, weakening is doubled, or only the corruption About him, and in it that it is a cost of it, who is mentioned by what we mentioned, and what is meant from the earth is at the gathering, the land of the end, and it is permissible to want it, and others will come to it Their corruption, and it is permissible to want all the lands, and to seek gender, and their corruption is on the one hand that the many disobedience, and the righteousness of the people, and the righteousness, With the stretching of the absurdity, dug the country, and distribute the blessings, and that is a righteousness that prevails in the lands, then this is then the phenomenon of the Qur’an does not indicate the consequences of this Exponation, so it is inevitable that this is a developed, and it is required that this be a single time, and the one is the verer, and the stories in this matter are many, not many, and not It is true for him, and he Some of the two medicines denied this occurrence, and said how to release the great water of the great water?This denial is with the perception of God Almighty to change the good and the seizures.The magnets attracts the union, and the throat stones shames the poetry, and the abundant stone for the servant is repelled from it, and all of it is one of the paths of the pill, and if it is not the same Disclosure to them, so it is not possible to create in another stone, the power of attracting water from under the ground, and it is the creation of that power of the power of the heart, Peace be upon him, and he responded that he was after that he commanded him and he will be separated, and his separation from the earth does not contradict him, as he was concerned, and he will be immersed in the same way A force that I will leave in the stone (P-273) water with the removal of the albusah from its parts, and the creation of the wet in it, and God Almighty is upon everything that is destined, The human spirit and its attributes in the world of the heart, with the garment of Moses and its people, and he is consistent with his Lord for its narrators with the water of wisdom and the knowledge, and it is a matter Two peoples of negation and tricks are a light at the wasting of the darkness of the soul, and it was carried from the presence of pride on the stone of the heart that is like the stroke, as it is like a slander, as it is like a slander.Twenty -one of the wisdom, because the word is not God except God The connections of the human characteristics, which are twenty -pre -stories from the phenomenon and the interior, and two two hearts, and the soul, and each of them is a drink from the eye of the wast He knew his drink and a drink of each one, where his stem is his arms, and his leaders led him, so from a drink of freshness of the veils, and the salt of the salt, the rituals of the ritual And the aspects of the cores of the righteousness, the scenes and the secrets, narrate from the eyes of the truths, as the descriptions of the attributes of the legs and their Lord, their Lord, is an purification of the sake of the sake of the sake And drink from God's sustenance with his command and satisfaction, and do not send in this heart the spoiler by the blessing of the matter, and the choice On the birth,
