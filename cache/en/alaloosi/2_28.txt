to be exalted, and that there is no exalt From it, the exalted, but they said: If the admiration is returned from God, the exalted and the exalted, the warning is not necessary, as it is dismissed to the address They are atoned, and he did not come to the past, and if the disbelievers have fallen from them, because the one who denies the permanence and the harms is the feeling of it, and it is not in the words of the words The infidelity, whoever believes in the most common companions, may God be pleased with them.You were a mother, so I will live you, then he will die, then he will live for you, then to him, you will return what was before, then there is a state of guarantee (you atone), with the ability to be able to do so The meaning: How do you disbelieve, and you have created you, and he expressed the creation with that, and when it was a ride in the class, and created in the minds that there is no one, but it is not the case, but it is not.The infidels are agreed, and the

knowledge of the story, as if it was said: How do you atone and you are aware of this story and the first and the last of it It is not valid to fall off, and this is a group that is achieved, and life is a power that follows the domestication, and it is broken from the power of the powers, and it was said: Al -Muflouj is alive, otherwise, corruption is accelerated, and the sense of the verb does

and it is installed in the outside if I want its entirety, and it will be made from the permissibility Its aspirations and its progress, and on what is specially from the human being, such as the mind

the life of life, whoever is described by it, and a truth, if it is easy for him to say The salty, and the words of each other are understood that it is in the sense of the dead on the second interpretation, and if it was interpreted by the life of life, it was a truth, and it was a truth, When the first death was carried on the two years after the sake of the wandering, and the first life
