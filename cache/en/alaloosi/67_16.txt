The Quranic researcher believed in the sky, and he is God, glory and exalted, as he went to him other than one other, and he said to the interpretation of those in the sky, his command is that he will be in the sky.That in it is an additional added and the origin of those in the sky, when the added was deleted and the added of the added to him, his position was raised and seen.It was said: On the ability of the creator of those in the sky and it was said: In a meaning on it and the high is intended to be fiercely The sky is as if it was said: (I believe) whoever claims that he is in the sky while he is declining from the place, and this is in the end of the absurd The burden of ignorance is as it is not hidden from the description, or it is otherwise, it is the best of it, and the one who went to each other, and it was said: I want the peace of the king By managing this world and Gabriel was said to him, peace be upon him, and he is the king who is entrusted with luster, and the imams of the predecessor did not go to others who are up to him.And he said ﷺ: "" believe in its similarity." And he did not say the first of him, then they believe that it is (glory and exalted) in the sky in the sense that he wanted to be with him with the fullness of the Tanzah, and the hadeeth of the neighbor is the strongest of this.With the first son of the successor, it is a confusion of the edema of the first time.And in the opening of the righteous to the Hafiz Ibn Hajar, the male and -Sunnah of Muhammad ibn al -Husan al -Shibani, he said: The agreement of all of them is from the righteous to the righteous to al -Muharraq to al -Mugharb And the hadiths that the charters came from the Messenger of God ﷺ in the attribute of the Lord, without similarity and no interpretation.Al -Bayahqi supported a Sahih bond on the authority of Ahmad ibn Abi al -Hwari on the authority of Safyan ibn Aynah: Everything that God Almighty has described him with his soul in his book, and his soul is in his book.And the silence of it and this is the way (P-16) Al-Shafi’i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.And the imam of the two sacreds in the systematic message said: The scholars have disagreed with these doorsh, so he saw some of them interpreting it, and that is in the verse of the book, and what is true of the book, and what is true The predecessor to the purity of the interpretation and the procedure of the distress on its resources and the crushing of its suffering to God, glory and exalted, and whom we see in the opinion of God, and we will see it.The predecessor of the nation for the signs of the heir that the nation’s gathering is a pilgrimage, and if he would be interpreted by this distress, it was not for you, and it is not for you.With the branch of the law, as the era of the companions and the followers were drawn up on the expatriates from the interpretation, that was the follower, the following is the end of the imam.The transfer was presented in that from the people of the third era, and they are the jurisprudence Their paths, and so whoever took from them from the imams, how does it not document what the people of the centuries agreed upon the three of the three centuries, and they are the best of the centuries with the testimony of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the authority The words of the preservation ended on the face of the confusion.And the texts of the imams were transferred to conduct that on the backs with eagerness from otherwise, which leads to a more simplified and taught, and it has been touched, and it has been written in it.Looking and rejected.And in the alerts of the minds of the sheikh of our sheikhs, Abraham Al -Kawrani is that the consensus of the three centuries is to conduct the similar to its resources with the rituals of the time.An indication that the street, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.The transmitted evidence is in the same matter, even if the sane imagined is in the way of view and thought.The knowledge of God is the Almighty with this gravity of the characteristics of this is the end of that.And I say in the interpretation, follow the suspicion and say in God (glory and exalted) without knowledge, otherwise they do not limit what they remember from the meaning in it with the matter that there is no matter The interpretation of one thing is one of the stretches, and the predecessor has peace of that, and this is sufficient in it in the sense of the best of the question.؎ (Ali), if I say, my belief, let the ignorance of the ignorance think of an aggression and read a farewell “Amana” by achieving the first gossip, and the second and the second of the Fif.Qanbul read the dispensing of the first, or to include what was accepted by it, which is the vision of the enemy, and for it, and from the workshops other than that as well.And the words of the Almighty say that the earth is inspired by the insult of a detection from (who) and it is permissible to be on the authority of the neighbor, that is, whoever loses it and the place of the time, or the ritual And the land is effective with it to lose it, and the luster may be transgressing.That is, you believe that the earth will go to a bottom of you, and the claim of some of them is obligatory for its obligation, and that the earth is erected by removing the reckoning, that is, to be lost, and that it is not the right to you.If it is when eclipse, it will be wrapped and a severe firmness, and the origin of the hesitation in the coming and the dullness.
