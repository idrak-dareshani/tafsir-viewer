The Quranic researcher will ask you about the month of the forbidden, the son of Ishaq, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim and Al -Bayaki from the way of Zaid bin Rumum on the authority of Arwa, said: The Almighty - Abdullah ibn Jahsh, and he is the son of the aunt of the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - to a palm tree, so he said: Be with it until it is a brother And he did not command him with a fight, and that is in the month of the forbidden, and he wrote a book for him before he taught him where is he walking, so he said: I go out and your companions until you are so, then you will be so And look at it, so what I commanded you, so go to it, and do not deny it one of your companions on the goat with you, so when two days walked, then the book is shown, and if it is: We came from the news of Quraysh, with what he called to you, “He said to his companions - and they were eighty - when the book read: Hearing and obedience, who was from you, who was from you, Let us divorce me, for I am a past for the command of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and whoever hates him from you, let him return, for God - God bless him We have forbidden me to deny it one of you, and the people spent with him even if they were in the vicinity of Saad Bin Abi Waqqas and Aqaba Bin Ghazwan, who was a mourning of them.They are asking him, and the people went until they went down, and Amr ibn al -Hadrami passed by them, and the authority of Amr ibn al -Hadram Bin Abd Allah with a merchant with which they have passed by the sect, as the blood and customs, so when the people saw them, the one who was honored by the son of Abdullah, and he was a shadow, and he was a shadow Halik said: Ammar is not a bad for you, and the people commanded them to the companions of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him You are to kill them in (the month of the forbidden), and if you leave them, you will enter into this night - the Mecca of the forbidden - and let the people of you, so that the people of you will be killed Farmi Qadam ibn Abdullah al -Sahami Amr ibn al -Hadrami with an arrow, so he killed him, and Athman bin Abdullah and the authority of the son of Kaysan were captured.And they resigned, and they came to it on the Messenger of God - may God bless him and grant him peace He, peace be upon him - the two captives and the elderly, and nothing was taken from it, and when the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said to them - what he said, they have fallen in the hands of them.And their brothers violated them from the Muslims, and Quraysh said - when they attained them as a matter of these -: He was shed Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - the money, and the money, And the month was broken by the forbidden, and it came down, so the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - took - (p -108) Al -Ayer and the one who came to the two captives.And that they met those at the end of it on the day of it, and in the narration of Al -Zuhri on the authority of Arouda: - May God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and they said: Is it permissible to fight in the month of the forbidden?So God - the Exalted - the verse, “and from here it was said: those who are the parties are the parties, and it is supported that what will come from the remembrance of the reply, the infidelity and the latter, the most great To be an agreed to be angry with them to be inflicted by the believers, and the choice of the most patients that the questioners are the Muslims, and they said: and they said: The witness is disclosed by the intended, and what is meant is from the month of the forbidden, a righteous or a darkness, so (a) is in it for the covenant, and the many and the appearance is that it is for the sons, so it is the same Al -Qaddah, the pilgrim, the forbidden, and the righteous, and the name (deprived) of the prohibition of fighting in it, and the meaning ask you - that is - the Muslims or the infidels on the one In which there is a detection of the month; Since the first is not enough for the one who is intended to be exhausted to the second, it is a conscience for him without the whole and partiality, and the abuser is a warden or a worker of the one who is true.It is a duty to be in the manner of everyone as he stipulated the consent, and the servant of God read: (on the authority of a fight), and it is also the same as a detection, except that it is the repetition of the worker, and he reads ( In it), and so in saying that there is a greatness in it, that is: a great and a minister, and in it a report of the prohibition of fighting in the month of the forbidden month, and that what was believed to be from the prestige of God - may God bless him - may God bless him - may God bless him In it is false, and what was signed from his companions - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him - was from the chapter of sin in the guidance, and he is pardoned by him - but whoever strived and sinned, and he has a reward for him That this judgment is woven with his saying -their grace -: If the most deprived of the most deprived, then kill the entrepreneurs where you find them, then the meant The travelers are forgiven for the travelers in it, with the words of the Almighty: So they will be forgiven in the land of four months, and the most deprived of it is not for every year, so that it is a year.After its dissolution, it is tired of it in all the places and the elders, and it is a copy of the year, and our Hanafi pioneers are saying to him Approval over the year or delayed for him; To be the public for them, they think, and the thinking does not oppose Al -Quta’i, and the imam said: He who has that the verse does not indicate the prohibition of fighting as a divorced woman In the month of the forbidden; Because the fighting has a denial in a stable space, then it is not a matter, then there is no need for then to the saying of the transcription, and it was assumed that it is a general to form a year In the revelation of the shrine, and if the ladder of the partners ’fighting is intended to be cut off; Because the Muslims ’fighting is forbidden, unlawful, uninterrupted by the most sacred, and in it we do not surrender that it is a description of a pharaoh to be the neighbor of the neighbor, The ladder of the lower general, but it is specific to it with the battlefield in the month of the appointed prohibition, and the useful description of the public is the equal description of the general in the general His exalted say: There is no bear in the land, nor a bird that flies with his two sides, and the saying of the poet: “If you see the lizard with it, it will be a success and the one who is the one who is the one who is the answer to the answer, And the fact that the partners are intended for the general public, not a Muslim; Because the words are in the special fighting, and if it is the ladder of its general in the question, we do not surrender its general in the answer, based on what the desire mentioned that the denial of the remembrance of it if it is mentioned if it is mentioned if it is mentioned.Known; We have: I asked me about a man and the man like this and so, in his denial here, you alert him to the fact that what is meant is not for his ruling, this is the ruling of God - the ritual of God - the peace of God - For the people of Mecca, this was not a ruling, so he said - upon him, peace and blessings be upon him -: Because the fighting of the people of the prostitute is permissible and they are Muslims, fairness is that the saying of the transcription is not a harmful, we are able to do it, and it is possible.On the authority of them -as it was narrated from the laughter, and he came out (p -109), the son of Abu Hatim on the authority of Sufyan Al -Thawri, that he was asked about this verse, and he said: This is something that is not, and this is a thing, The month of the forbidden, and he is a gift from that, and he was narrated from him that he was asked about the fighting in the month of the forbidden, so he was in charge They are fighting in it, and he made a ruling on the Day of Resurrection, and the nation is the day on its disagreement in the walking of the vocals.(Hajj) Ibn Abbas and Al -Saddi, or (Al -Hajara) said as it was said, or (the bird of what the servant connects to God Almighty from obedience).Or by his path, and the mosque, the forbidden, the father of Hayyan, his kindness on the struggle of the pilgrims, and if the neighbor is not considered, and that the Kufic, Yunus, the people of the people, are permitted The tongue of the Arabs is a system and prose, and it is exposed to the fact that there is no meaning to disbelieve in the mosque, and it is necessary for the mosque.The one who is attached to it, as the Almighty saying: Whoever disbelieves in the tyrant and the choice of the judge is appreciated by added added to a homosexuality, that is: the mosque is repaid and the one who is the one who is the one The prostration, and it was assumed that the addition of the added and the meeting of the added to it is a shortage of the hearing, and it is answered by preventing the release, so in the sacrifice: if the added is the addition of it: Or a detail without a previous addition, such as the deleted and the meaning, it is permissible to delete the additive and the meeting of the added to it is a measure; We are: (What is the same as more and his father say that); That is, the same as his father, and the like: (What is all the signs of a time, or the white of a grease), and if one of the paths is spent, it was shortened by the hearing, and when we are in the same way He was deleted from him, and the choice of the Zamakhiri, his kindness on the path of God Almighty, and it was assumed that he was kind and disbelieved in him and a repulsion of what is from that; As compassion is not provided for the connection to the compassion, it is mentioned to the authenticity of that.One of them is that it is disbelieving in the sense of the replacement of the path of God, so kindness is on the way of interpretation, as if it was said: It is a replacement of the path of God, the meaning of it, and the one who is unbelievers, In my foreigners, secondly, it is a position and disbelieve in it is a punishment and the mosque is the forbidden, except that it was presented to the excess of care, as in the saying of the Almighty: From the right of speech: and no one was enough for him.It is not hidden that the first face is the first; Because the adherence does not remove the warning of the chapter and increase the warning of another, and the choice of the Sajandi, the compassion of the month of the month, and he was weak that the people did not ask.The deprivation, and the choice of the father of the survival, as it is related to a deleted verb, which was denied by the replacement; That is, they repel the mosque, as they said: They are those who disbelieved and repelled you from the mosque, and it is weak that he was deleted, and he did not go to the mind There is only in the poetry, and it was said: Wow is for the division and it was located in the verbal of the words, and it is as it was seen.And the delay of his family from him, and they are the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and the believers, but they were his family; Because they are standing with his rights, and it was said: That is to adhere to that they make his family in the future after the Mecca opened.The greatest of God is the news of the enemy things from the brides of Quraysh, and (do) who is equal in which the one is the one who is mentioned and the feminine, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is mentioned and the feminine, and the feminine.That is, from what the secret worked as a mistake in the guidance, and the origin of the verb in that verb is based on the leadership.And the temptation is greater than the killing, which is not presented to the affirmation of the affirmation, the kindness of the whole judgment on the part of the part; That is, what the Muslims are fascinated by and torture with it, so that they will atone for the greatest of God from the killing, and what is mentioned in it inside the entry of the first, and the first: What is meant by the unbelieving temptation, and the words are great for the small (P-110) deleted, and it has been done to be angry for the precedent judgment and they are still fighting you until you will leave you On the one who asks you about the union in the chain of transmission, if the questioners are the participants, or are the ones that are unjust if those who are unaware of them, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.With the way of cautiousness to the believers about them, and wake them up to the abundance of indifference with their horizons in some things, and even for the sake of you They return you from your religion, and his words are exalted: If you are stuck, they are attached to what is in it, and the expression is that the repetition of their obedience, and that it is not permissible, and that it is not permissible.The referral is exposed, and the benefits of piety with the condition of the alert to the fear of their minds, and the time of their enmity is a verb, and there is no reward, and it is not a good.Related to (they still fight you); As there is no meaning for their fences on the enmity, if they are able to do it, but it is immersed.Ibn Attiyah went to the fact that even the absence, and the piety of the condition, then because the end is the metaphor of the struggle and the pursuit of the purpose of the end, As in the words of the Almighty: until the camel enters into the poison of the sewing, in which it is that the endowment of the end of the end is what is arranged by it, and the end of the hostility, And the saying with certainty is not sure, we can bear the end, even if I want from the fighting with its real, and it is the condition of the condition, and it is not suspended Excavation that the fighting is left in some of the facts because of their obedience, except that the meaning is then it is vulnerable to as it is not hidden.And whoever renovates you from his religion, the right to deliver them and their seduction, or fear from their enmity By administering his equity in the way of the prayer of the increase and death on the disbelievers and the distance it is in it; To do the sense of a house of those who do that in evil and corruption, and gathering and individuals in view of the memorial and the meaning whose business has been seen, that is: their work became in the case Islam is a poverty with a home that was not, it was said: The origin of the dumplings is a corruption that causes the lives to eat the frustration, and it is a warning from the painful, and in the good His heroes, it is said: his work was lined up, and I loved it, and it is one of them, and it is one of them: Until you swollen, then you die, and read: (she was lined up) with openness, and it is a language in it.In the world and the hereafter for the slowdown of what they imagined and the atmosphere of what is of peace in the first and the rituals of reward in the other.And those who are the people The disbelief, and their faith is not sang for them, and the Shafi’i inferred from the verse on the fact that the response does not lurk the work until it dies, and it is for you to die.I loved the divorced woman, as it was to be given to his saying, his grace: He is dead and he is a dedicated disbeliever, and he said that his idiot is that (he was frustrated), so that he is all the things.In the first place, it is eager to die on the infidelity, even if he died a believer (does not be confused) his faith, nor a work that compares him, and that does not contradict the frustration of the two sins of the righteous The increase is what it means; Because what is meant is in the verse of the preceding.As there is no meaning for the love of what it did not do, then this is not the saying that it is not hidden, and it was said: based on the fact that he made the death on it, and the condition of the condition, and the condition of the condition, and the condition of the condition, The conditions are fulfilled, and it was assumed that the stipulation and the attachment are not in this sense, but rather the captivity and the obligatory The caused or the abuse of the number of reasons, and if it was a condition in this sense, the choice of the saying was not imagined with the understanding of the condition, and the sacrifice of the stipulation of God He exalted him - until the excess of the pluralism requires frustration because of his saying: And whoever disbelieves in faith is lost his work and what he has seen in the Shafi’i Because it is completed if (P-111) was a sentence (and those), etc.Fleeing and immortality in the fire arranged on the death of the response, so we do not receive his misery, and whoever claims that is exposed to the imam Abu Hanifa - may God be pleased with him - may God be pleased with him - may God be pleased with him He has the pregnancy of the one who is based on the two ways, and it is answered that the launching of the reaches of the restriction of the restrictions has been carried out in the rest of it.Hadith, and what is here in the cause, so it is not permissible for a bond that the divorced woman is like a restriction, and the fruit of the dispute is what was said to appear in the right of the righteous, then the peace of God And the time remains, for it is obligatory for the imam with a disagreement of the companion, as well His work with his reward or not?Then some went to the first while the companion, so it returns a repetition from the reward, and the Gallas went to the second, and that his work is returning without reward, and no reward, and no separation, and no separation, and no separation, and no separation, and no separation, That is the one who is intended in the gold, and it is understood.
