The Quranic researcher said that he is a vocalist from a silver and the words on the likeness, so what is meant is a gathering between the coating of the bottles, its lips, and the softness of the silver.And Abd al -Razzaq, Saeed ibn Mansour and al -Bayaki, were broken on the authority of Ibn Abbas, who said: If you took a silver from the silver of the world, then you will be struck until it made it so that it would make it.The water is seen behind it, but the heaven is the heart of silver with the strains of the boats.And the son of Abi Hatim was removed from him that he said: There is nothing in the paradise, except that you have been given in the world like the likeness of the world.Nafaa, Al -Kisa’i, and Abu Bakr, read the “Burns” in Al -Mawadahin, and his replacement and his replacement for a thousand people and a son of many people who prevented the sake of the second The faction and the last verse, and he stood on it with a thousand problems for others from the words of the communities and the obstacles at the time of the first in the first, in the first place in the first one of the thousand of the thousand of the launch The eyes were agitated, and in the second to follow, then it is mentioned, and the reading by preventing them from their behavior of Hafs, Ibn Amir, Hamza, Abu Amr, and the readers of the people.That is, they are the sacrifices that they are able to estimate, that is, they appreciated those bottles in themselves.The saying of Al-Ta’i: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ” The dignity of the adjectives, in terms of no more than that.Ibn Abbas said: They came to it on the need, and they do not prefer anything and do not desire anything after it and from a Mujahid that it is estimated that it is not in the fullness of it, nor is the one who is not.It is angry, so the guarantee is what is apparent to the sects of those who are delegated with it.And Abd al -Hamid and Ibn al -Mundhir narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said that the watering was able to be bored and it was said: The meaning was destined for their righteousness and the righteousness of the righteous On this, it was said to the angels and it was said to the breeze.And Ali, the generosity of God Almighty, read his face, Ibn Abbas, Al -Salami, Al -Sha’abi, Qatada, Zayd ibn Ali, Al -Jahiri, and Al -Asma’i on the authority of Abu Umar and Ibn Al -Omar.And others, "they appreciated it" on the construction of the verb and disagreed with its exit, and Abu Ali said: The memorizers were able to do it, and in the sinner, it is a heart that was said that it is true that it is true that it is true.They are the same as the Almighty saying, as soon as it is his confessions, as it is the same as the first of power [Al -Qasas: 76] and the saying of the Arabs if you come up.Al -Zamakhshari said: This is the face of the thing By lightness, that is, you have shown his destiny, so he transferred to the activity, so they are prepared for two of them, one of whom is the opponent of the acting of the perpetrators, and the second is, and the meaning is that they have made it like that They have to be able to be able to do what they desires and Abu Hatim said: I was estimated at the destiny of their opinion, so some of them would be interpreted by that in the words that he was omitted, and he was a slander that he was omitted, and he was a slander that he was omitting They saw them, and he was omitted, and the act of the actor, then he was deleted, and their opinion became the deputy of the actor, then he was omitted, became the collection of the representative of the actor, and the one who did not Its destiny said that Abu Hayyan al -Aqbib said that the origin would be the destiny of their irrigation from it.So she was deleted from the verb to the guerrilla of itself, and they became able to do it, so it was not in it except an added and widening in the process.It is not hidden that the heart is Zayaf and what some decided to cost in a good cost, and in the fact that Abu Hayyan has chosen by what he chooses from what God has seen, and perhaps more than him.
