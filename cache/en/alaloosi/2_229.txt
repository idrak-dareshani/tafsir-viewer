The Quranic researcher divorced two times a sign of the divorce of the concept of his words, the Almighty: and they are their right to their cold, which is the back, and it is in the sense of the divorce of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one In the sense of peace - because it is described as the one and the number of the number of women, and that is supported by the remembrance of the action of the man, as well With a well -being, that is, by the return and the goodness of the pamphlets, or a relaxation with goodness, that is: a release accompanied by him from the barrier of the rhetoric and the performance of the rights, and that is not that it is not.The third is called - which is the influencer - then the father of David and a group were broken from Abu Razin al -Asadi, “A man said: O Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - He says: The divorce is two times, so the third is?This indicates that the meaning of (two times) is two times, and supports the covenant (as loyal) in the first part, because its appearance is obstructed with no humiliation, and the ruling of the thing is that it is not.The one who carried the Shafi’iyyah the verse, and perhaps he has a long -standing system; Where the remembrance of the right has been achieved to the remembrance of the abuse, which is a divorce, then this was accomplished to the remembrance of the ruling (divorced) from the enemy and the return, then the release of this The punished divorce of the return, then he was carried out to the Bayan al -Khaliqah and the third divorce - and agreed with the cause On the authority of them - and otherwise on the ears, he said: “The man was if he divorced his wife, then he returned it before it is to pass it.A man to his wife, divorced her, even if you know that she was eliminated.And those who called them to that say: The collection of the three divisions is not forbidden, and that there is no Sunnah in the separation, as they are in their ways, and they are inferred from it.He did not know that he was released three times before he told him - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - with his prohibition on him.Because he fell into a believer in the meeting of the young woman, and with her concealment, the collection is forbidden at the violator, and with the forbidden, it is obligatory to deny the scholar, and the knowledge is not, It is not forbidden, and that he did a group of companions and informed him of others, and our Hanafi Sadat said: The group between the divorce and the three, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, but the one, When it was narrated in the hadith of “Ibn Omar - may God be pleased with them - that the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said to him: Repeal, so you can divorce it for every recipient reader.His soul is not a delegate, but rather from the path of the debt in religion - I mean what is not answered by punishment - and he has confined it - upon him the prayer and peace be upon him It is prepared from the gathering, and the divorce in the menstruation is a bid - that is, it is obligatory to achieve the punishment - and this is the payment of what was said: The hadeeth is indicated that it indicates that the group is in the way A single purification is not a year, and as for it, it is not a stability of the mediator at the opponent, and the defamation is a phenomenon as it is not hidden.And in the guidance: Al -Shafi’i said: All divorce is permissible; Because it is a mockery until the judgment is beneficial to it, the flicker does not collect the prohibition with the difference of divorce in the menstruation; Because the prohibited is the enemy of it, not divorce, and for us that the origin of divorce is the barrier of what is in it from the piece of marriage, which is related to the religion that is related to the religion.Pornography is for the need for salvation, and there is no need for collection between the three, and it is in separation on (the teeth) fixed in view of its indication, and the need in its soul is the rest, so the downtown It is on it, and the law is in itself from where it is the removal of the tenderness that does not contradict the barrier to the one other than it - which we mentioned - ended.And from him it is known that the violator is generalized - not divided The readers or the most famous, and you have learned that you will be divided by my father - may God bless him and grant him peace The singers - because the place of curse is narrow, then it is expressed in it like that, and it is excused in it.And the two signs of the two signs of the two of them, and they made the verse on the fact that what is meant by the legal launch is a launch after the launch of the separation; Since the street of the Shari'a is the legitimate matters, and the imam is not a text in the covenant, but the phenomenon of which is the gender, and also the use of the divorce with the grace With his saying: He is a constipation with a well -being, except that the one is said to be the ruling that is repeated between the steadfastness and the relaxation, and the one who does not know.The one divorce is only with the text of the text, and this direction is with it as a distance from the delusion of the righteousness and its significance on the ruling of the one, with the goodness, Excellence, and the significance of the verse is then what they went to appear, if the meaning of (two times) is a regeneration of disbelief, they repeat the resurrection of the one who will return That is A hat, not two rituals, except that it is necessary for him to break the time of its appearance, as well Extracting the admission of their knowledge of the severity of the launching, and it is not arranged on the first of the harm that the divorced separation does not arise from it.Because if the three are not permissible after the constipation or the relaxation, and the (fulfillment) is carried at that time on the male structure; That is, if you know how to divorce the divorce, know that the ruling of the missionary or the rest (P-137) is the constipation in the man Demonstration as the investigators said - based on the fact that it is a fact in the second, an apparent appearance in the first; As it is not said to someone who is driven to the last two dirhams, one time Two times - the hadith of the convergence of the disagreement of the phenomenon in the trinity as it is an apparent, and after it also for the correctness of the arrangement, and it is the one who is permissible The two calls are beneficial from (two times) indicating the separation and trinity, and the number of collection between the third is benefiting from the saying of it.What he accepted with the fulfillment of it was said: It is beneficial from the indication of this text, then those who have been obligated to separate, he went to the fact that if he divorced, it is not a division and a divorce, and he was in the divorce, And some of the people of the Sunnah - such as Sheikh Ahmad Bin Taymiyyah and whoever follows him - said: If three were divorced with a single memorial, he would not fall into one of the people The curse and the throwing of the Jamra, for if he came with the fourth with one word that is not considered four for it with consensus, and so if it was threw in the seventh of the storms of the time of the time, the seventh of the time of the time, And like that, if not to pray to the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - a thousand times, so he said: May God’s prayers and peace be upon him Once, it is not a righteous who did not come with a thousand, and hold on to what a Muslim and Abu Dawid, the women, the ruler, and the al -Bayaki, have come to the authority of God.He said: “The three divorce was on the covenant of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and my father is a good and two years from the disagreement of Omar, so he said: In which there are people in it, even if it is a place for them, and he gave it to them.Also; when Al -Bayahqi was removed from Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - he said: Honorable, and the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - asked him: How did you divorce her?He said: I divorced it three, he said: In a single sitting?He said: Yes.And the answer to the pilgrims with the verse is that it is as you taught, not a text in the intended, and the hadith was answered by a group; Al -Sibaki said: The best of the wages is that it is the one who knows the word, so they were first believed in the will to confirm the Diyadiyyah, so when there was more The reconciliation is their belief and the rhythm of the three, and the science of Ibn Hajar was exposed, saying: It is surprising, for the sacrifice of our belief is the friend of the He reached the immorality of what was reached, then he was transferred from some investigators: that the best of it was that they were used to divorce, then in the time of Omar - may God be pleased with him - may God be pleased with him They signed it three, so he treated them with his judgment, and the three were signed by them, so it is a news about the disagreement of the habit of people, not from the abomination His custodian for the prestigious appearance of the words of Omar, especially with the saying of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - the three, etc.On the authority of his son, he was good, then he said: The best of me is that it is answered by the age - may God be pleased with him - when the people were expressed in it, in which he did not know what he did, so he did not.And that transcriber; Either it is reported to be nullified or gathered, and it is only for a text, and then the nation’s scholars are applied to him, and the news of Ibn Abbas is that the absence is the one who is the one who was His death - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - has ended, and I say the three divorce in the words of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - he will be able to be with one, and one of them The recipient of the claimant appears, and he supports this involvement, which appears to be what the father of David has brought him out of him, if the man says to his wife: You are three, three Then it is answered by copying, and it is necessary to be three conservatives in one council, like you, you are divorced.(P-138) Three is attached (with a saying), not a characteristic of a deleted source; That is, three divorce, and it does not distinguish for the dignity that is in the sentence before it, and with one mouth with a follower, and then the news is agreed with the news of his family, That this is in divorce before the income, for it is also a single one, as Imam Abu Hanifa - may God be pleased with him - went to him -; Because the between the first chain of transmission, its second encounters, which is a builder, is indicated by what Abu Dawood has taken out Al -Bayahqi is about a peacock, “A man is said to him: the father of the lustful was the many question to Ibn Abbas.One on the covenant of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and my father is a good and a chest from the emirate of Omar?By making it one one on the covenant of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and my father Bakr and a chest from the emirate of Omar, and when the people have seen it, they said: This is a pharmaceutical question that was on the covenant of the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and he was not seen in the correctness that it was raised to it, and he said to it, and he said to it, and he said to it He falls into the remote positions at the end of his command - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and he will strive for those who have a knowledge and make it one, and he will make it one of God He exalted them - she is permissible that the angel is the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him -, but rather in his saying: (Make it one) a sign of what we said - A few days of his disagreement, he appeared to him with the guidance that the first saying is the three halls of the three, but it is the difference of our gold, and it is a lot of people of the companions They were exalted - and he was brought out by Malik, Al -Shafi’i, Abu Dawood, and Al -Bayaki from Muawiyah ibn Abi Ayyash, that he was sitting with the servants of God, Ibn Al -Zuba Muhammad ibn Abi Iyas ibn al -Bakir, and he said: A man from the people of Al -Badiya divorced his age three before he entered it, so what do you see?Ibn al -Zubayr said: This matter is what we have in which we have a saying, and he goes to Ibn Abbas and my father Hurairah, because I left them when he said: Ibn Abbas to Abu Hurairah: He missed him, O Abu Hurairah, so you have come to you He marries a husband other than him, and Ibn Abbas said like that, and if you carry the three in this news about what was with one word; If the imam does not contradict, then if the man divorces his wife, who is not entering it three with one word and one who falls on it; Because the location is a source of omitting; Because it is a clear divorce, if you were not a rhythm at one time, and he signed a sentence, this news was opposed; When a Muslim narrated it in support of the transcription, like the news that Al -Tabrani and Al -Bayaki have brought out from Swid ibn Ghafila, he said: “Aisha was the one who is the one Ali - may God be pleased with them - and he said to her: He was killed by me - God honored and face And you appear tattoos, so go, and you are three, and he said: So she wrapped her clothes and fell until she spent her enemy, and she sent her to her, and she was sent to her.And ten thousands of charity, when the Messenger came to her, she said: A little goods from the beloved of separation, and when he reached it, he said, then he said: If only I heard my father He heard my grandfather saying: “Whatever a man divorced his wife three times when the readers or three times are not a vague, and she did not come to him until she marries a prostitute for him,” On the authority of Al -Sha’abi, he said: “I said to Fatimah Banat Qais: You talk to me about your divorce, and she said: Ali and peace be upon him -“As for the hadith of a pillar, it was narrated on He divorced his wife, and he told the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - with that, and he said: And God is what I wanted (p -139) except one, and he said: You only wanted one?The number in it is an adequate, and it may be inferred from the health of the three with one memorial; Deadly, and the measurement of the testimonies of curse and throwing the rituals is a measure other than its place, not to see that it is not possible to suffice with some of that in the face of the three, and the one is in the face of the three The divorce is, and the between the elimination of the enemy, and the incursion is fulfilled, and the greatest of the curse is not in it, except with the same, with the same, with the same as the testimony.With a fifth -in -law, I am in the side of the man if he was liar and in her side with anger, if he was honest, then perhaps the return or the rituals of the ritual, or the rituals, The limit is held and the sins are atoned, and the fourth testimonies are the fourth of the man who is the fourth of the lines of the four aspects in the threw of the fortified, with the increase of the increase.His exalted saying: And those who throw the fortifieds, then they did not come with four testimonies, and bring them with them with his saying, and the one who is: They have a testimony, except for themselves, and the martyrs of one of them are four testimonies, etc.The rituals and their sacrifice are a hidden secret, so it is reserved for him, and the influence is followed by the example of the slander, and the chapter of the division is not from the chapter It is in it that it is three, and one is one, and we do not cancel it in it for the three memorials that he did not mean to it except for it, and it is not the rhythm of it.The question of the solution is that a thousand times are not prayed that he does not justify what he did not come with a thousand thousand, so a matter is required by the intent And he returned from the people of the house what supported the people of the Sunnah, and the Bahaqi was brought out from Bassam al -Sarafi, he said: I heard Ja`far ibn Muhammad: Three with ignorance or knowledge, then I have been acquitted, and on the authority of Musalmah ibn Jaafar al -Ahmus, he said: I said to Jaafar bin Muhammad - may God be pleased with them - With an ignorance, he returned to the Sunnah, making it one one who tells you about you?He said: God forbid, what is this from our saying who divorced three, and he said, as he said, and you have heard what we have narrated from the good, and what the imam has taken from him - and he will see it from the authority of God - From what you do not prove, and the matter of his disagreement, and he has avoided him on me - God Almighty honored his face - an sheikh of the kufa, and I have acknowledged the conquest of the people - Let us preserve what we have recited, for I do not think you find it in a book.It is not permissible for you to take in the interview of divorce from what they have come to, that is: from charity, for that is contradictory to charity, and the like in the judgment is a ward To raise the habit or to alert it to the fact that the solution of taking from what is from that is from the first door, and the neighbor and the boundaries must be attached to what is from it or from it; Because if he was late for him, he was a rival to him, and the obedience to the compassion, the speech with the rulers, and the chain of transmission and the coming to them; Because they are commanding them when they are brightened, and it was said: It is a speech for the eras, and it is mentioned that it is a distortion of the generous system; Because his saying is up to the Almighty: except that they are afraid, that is, the adulterers are both, or one of them, not the limits of God by the blessing of the residence of the obligatory duty of the husband, and it is not unnecessary with him; Because the one who expresses it in the rhetoric is the only ones, and in the absence of marriages and wives, and it is not possible to carry it on the tattooing; It is a condition for him to be the one who expresses it in the two ways, and where is this condition?Yes, this is a healthy face, but it does not be ashamed and does not enrich, which is that the discretion is not after the speeches of the speech from the best of the conditions or the abuse (p-140) (p-140) The meaning will be in the cause of the reasons, except by the causes of fear.(Fear) and (accommodate) the winter of the speech and the matter is the matter On the exaggerated zooms, and the expression of the accumulation of the two parties, and read the Hamza and Jacob: (they fear) the construction of the one who is alleged) In the way of a disgrace as your saying: Franding is a more zero (God's limits), and the readers of the servant of God: (Unless they are afraid) and Ibn Attiyah said: One of them: the verb is bored with it, and the other is able to estimate the letter of a deleted dispute, so it is a place (that) was done with the valued neighbor, or the one who is in the righteousness of the ritual The sea is that it was not reminded of the grammarians when they prepared for two to two, and the origin of one of them is with the ritual of the run, and in the readers of my father: (except that he thinks) With fear, if you fear a speech for the judgments, it is not other than; Like the change in the chain of transmission, before the sentence she went to, the limits of God that he limited to them will not be destroyed.There is no wing on them, that is: the two husbands, and this is the existence of the place of the answer; That is, they passed them, because there is no wing, as it was redeemed with it, and it was broken, and it is not over the husband in taking it, nor has it to give it to me, it was brought out by my son.He was asked, was the immortality originally?Qais, “She came to the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and she said: O Messenger of God, my head is unanimously collected and his head is not the same He kissed in several times, so if he is the most black and shortened them, and their ears, her husband said: O Messenger of God, I gave her the best of my money, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me He said: What do you say?She said: Yes, and if I wanted to increase it, he said: So separate them from them.And the name of her name is Zenib, he came from the way of Darqatni, the preservation of Ibn Harj said: So he may have two names, or one of them is a neck, but it is a good way, and it is true, and it is more correct, Malik, Al -Shafi’i, and Abu Dawood, that the name of a woman who is a hard girl is a easy daughter.The two ways and the disagreement of the two of the two of those are the limits of God, a sign of the limits of the rulings from the saying of his two sins: the divorce is two times to here, for the sentence is for your goodness To prohibit the prohibition on it.So do not accommodate it with violation and refusal, and whoever is the limits of God, then those who are unjust 229 are a sacrifice for the exaggeration in the threat, and the wow, in the rhythm, and in the rhythm of The addict is not hidden from the insertion of the broker and the rability Shrinks; Because the denial of the solution that is the ruling of the contract in all the conditions except the state of discord indicates the corruption of the contract and the boundaries of its psalm, but it is not the same as the evidence for the shore of It is permissible to be in a whole that the husband stood up to it, as a result of the Zaid; Because (who) from what you have come to be white, then the benefit of the discretion is a solution that takes something from what they came from when the fear is, and what is the word (what is) Glory be to him: While it was redeemed, it is not an apparent in the general until it contradicts the appearance of the verse in the referee.The judgment of the concept of the way of the violation of the discretion, and its benefits the elaboration of the judgment and the denial of the wing in this contract, for the sake of the ritual The discretion may the wing may be with his hatred, and we will be overwhelmed by the general, so you will not be a text in the vastness of Jawaz (P -141), the immortality of what is said.May God be pleased with him -: He shake it, even if it is with its parts, and the first supports what Ahmad and Abu David and the trauma have come out.- May God’s prayers and peace be upon him -: “Whatever is a woman who asked her husband the divorce from other than a bad thing, and it is forbidden for her to smell paradise”, and he said: “ The second is what was narrated from some of the methods, "He - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - said to a beautiful: Ali and peace be upon him -: As for the Zaid, it is not.What is meant by what is beneficial to the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a hardship And the people of the two bodies with the consensus are achieved, and the end of the matter is a comparison, such as the sales of the call, and it does not contradict the permissibility, and that it is correct for the word Displaced, and he was disturbed that if he was running, he would not give up the divorce, then he will be dirty or divorced, and whoever made it, he will be transcribed, he will say to him: So if he divorced it, then he will be divorced, then he will be divorced.The remembrance of the two divisions requires that it be a divorced divorce, even if it was a divorce, and the appearance is that it is divorced, and for it our companions went, and it is a saying of the Shafa.With the choice of the husband, it is like the divorce of rises, then it will be.
