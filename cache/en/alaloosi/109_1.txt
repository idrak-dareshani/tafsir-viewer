The Quranic researcher, the disbeliever, and the name of the scars, as the son of Abi Hatim was brought up to Zarada ibn Wafi, and he is one of the men who are sick, if it is correct and innocent of any of the evil, It is also called as in the beauty of the readers, Surah Al -Abadah, and so is the surah of the brotherhood, which is when Ibn Abbas and Jamour are an angel.And Ibn Mardwiyyi was removed from Ibn Al -Zubayr that it is a civilian and said it in the sea on the authority of Qutah on the dispute of what is in the gathering of the Bayan that he said: It is an angel with agreement that is not in its place.Which is six without disagreement, and in it the announcement of what was understood from what was before the matter by the salvation of worship, has glory and glory, and it is sufficient for that in the occasion between them.And the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said to Jubla ibn Hareta, and he is the brother of Zayd ibn Harith, and he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: That is, as in a hadith that Imam Ahmad and Al -Tabrani brought out in the middle, and he commanded, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.Al -Bayahqi was brought out in the people and commanded him to pray and peace be upon him, as well as in a hadith that was brought out by Al -Bazzar and Ibn Mardawi.And Abu Yalla and Al -Tabrani were brought out of Ibn Abbas, who is marrying: “Do I not show you a word that will save you from the righteousness of God Almighty?You read: Say, O infidels, with your sleep.Al -Dawli narrated on the authority of Abdullah ibn Jarrad who said: “The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said:“ The hypocrite does not pray the victim and does not read: “O,” Its readers are also with Sora: Say: God is one of the knees of the year of the dawn that is for the largest, the best of the Sunnah is the salaries, and so in the rak'ah.A pilgrimage to the one who said from the imams that it is not enacted in the year of the dawn, which is a surah to Fatwa.It came in a hadith that Al -Tabrani was brought out in the middle of Ibn Omar Marifa, and in the last one that he was brought out in the young from Saad ibn Abi Waqqa, so that it is the same.And that Imam directed that the Qur’an is a disgrace to the matter with the commandments and the forbidden from the prohibits, and each of them is either related to the heart or the wickedness of it The surah is a distraction from the forbidden attached to the heart, so they will be the patch of the Qur’an, and it is followed by the servants (p-25) And the forbidden attached to it is not related to the affairs and the hearts of the heart and the gossip, and that the great Qur’an is not limited to the matter and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the matter Other distortions as the beginning of the beginning and the re -offered, and from here it was said: Perhaps the closest to it is said: The purpose of the Qur’an is Judaism, the laws of the law, and the conditions of the repetition, and the neutrality of the expression of God Almighty with worship, which is the one who called the prophets, the peace of God is upon them.Rather, he will be exhausted by the worship of God, and the worship of God is glorified and exalted; Specialization has parts; The negation of others and the evidence is for the one who is devoted to it, so the intentions are with this arrogance for four, and this surah is covered by the leaving of the servants of it So this compassion has become a quarter of the Qur’an and its formation is not in it.The description of the Qur’an and it was said: The narratives of the Qur’an are the attributes of the Almighty, the prophets, the rulings, and the sermons, and they are covered on the basis of the first, which is the neutrality, and therefore, and therefore it is the same, and it is the same.The deadline is the love of the two contemporary people, and it is better for that, as I see that the religion that the Qur’an includes four types: worship, transgressions, crimes, and signs, For the first numbers, it was a quarter.It was followed by that he wanted, and it was a quarter of the Qur’an, so we do not receive the authenticity A quarter of religion, there is no speech in it, but the words in their being are a few of the Qur’an; As it is the news that the news feels the choice of its provision, and the compliance between them is not the one who is recognized that the real metabolism between what is mentioned is complete.It is answered with an involvement that he wanted that the pods of the Qur’an are the four of which are the debt and it is not far from that one of them is the same as the Qur’an.It is not possible for the limit that one of its intentions is the beginning of the principle and the return; So the entry of that in worship with the noms of care and the fact that the real metaphor does not harm; It is sufficient for the exposure to the people of the families of those affairs, and if it is for the advertisement, then all of that is contemplated.And God is the Hemorrhoids of the Corps of the Holly.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Never.Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Al -Anbari, in Al -Muasf, were narrated from Saeed ibn Mawal, the Prophet of Abu al -Bakhtari, who said: “The Walid ibn al -Mughri, the son of al -Mughri Bin Al -Mutlab and the Umayyad of Bin Bin Khawal, the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him We are all in our matter, if the one who is more correct than him is the one who is more correct than you, you have taken from him We had taken us from him, and God Almighty revealed: Say: O disbelievers, until the surah was destroyed.Ali, peace be upon him: Hell, follow our religion, and follow your religion, worship our gods for a year, and worship your God for a year.And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God is mighty, the Almighty, to share with God, Glory be to Him, others." And they said: So some of our gods greeted you, we will believe you and worship your God, so you came down, and may God’s prayers and peace be upon him and peace be upon him And peace be upon their heads, so they read it to them, and they will be." "The infidels" without those who disbelieved; because the disbelief was the valley of their religion and did not renew them, or because the speech with those who know the most like Or for the hurry to mention what is said to be the strictness of his acquisition of it and with it without the entrepreneurs with that they are the idol of idols and the abundance So it is the most empty of their unjust.His call to him, peace and blessings be upon him, in their club, and the place of their hands is a sign of an indication of his heritage, peace and blessings be upon him.The fact of the matter is a disagreement of the owner of the interpretations of the disbelievers: O disbelievers
