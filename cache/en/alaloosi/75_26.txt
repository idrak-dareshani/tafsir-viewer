The Quranic researcher, no, is a deterrent from the altruism of the ultimate on the other, as if it was said that they were called from that and alerted to what is between you If any soul or the soul indicates the context of the words, as in the saying of Hatim: ؎ The mother of what the wealthy sings of the boy if it is brought up on the day and the one who is a day I sent, they want the rain, and hardly hear them, they say, the sky is sent, yes, it may be declared, as it is here, and it is said that the ritual of the soul is the one The rhetoric is the gap of the magic of Yamin and the north of the collection of Raqqah and sought to Derid ibn al -Saham: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ؎ It was said who is upset, that is, whoever attended her friend whoever promotes him and saved him from what is in which he is in the way I want the divorce of the doctor to be better than that he is called by saying or by deeds and narrated from Ibn Abbas and the laughter and Abu Qalbah and the murderer of what is in the way A realistic and it was said that it is an understanding of repetition and denial, that is, it has reached an exaggeration, and no one will promote it, as it is said to the one who is the one who is able to do this It was narrated from Akrama and Ibn Zaid, and it was said that he is one of the words of the angels of death This is on the authority of Ibn Abbas as well and Siliman Al -Tayami and the understanding of it is my right and followed by the fact that the angels of the mercy are appropriate It was driven by the fact that the guerrilla of the human being and the intended of the spectrum and the limitation after that on the conditions of some of the two parties is not incompatible with the general one before it is before and before it He started a sophisticated and bound the fans.One of the silences of a gentle silence to feel that they were two words, otherwise he would have been inhabited in those who are upset, so he said that Sibuyeh said that the noun is in the way Rashid and slurring with a richness and a richness, and he did not remember the purification, and it is possible that it is said that the collarback is a conscious opinion, and the sheikh of the scholar is a scholar, and it was a scholar.Rather, he also mentioned his Sibui in that, too, that the clearing of the mother and her slurring with the opinion is good.By saying the exalted, if it reaches the righteousness that the soul is a body, not a juice, as it does not describe the movement and the partisan The chain of transmission is the boundary of the life, not the spirit of the matter, and it is the deceased, without the time, and the other is that what is meant by its justification is the righteousness of the ritual What is described by the deceased, as it does not call a movement, does not bought, and does not surround them from what is improved by it.It was claimed that it could not be the will of the truth, and if the soul was a boundary, the fierceness is that its rhetoric is not fulfilled only after its parties, the heart of the heart, and the heart of the heart, and the heart of the heart, and the heart of the heart, Whoever is up to the first face is in it, and it is also not what he remembers after what he will learn if God wills, may God bless him The soul, which is the command of the matter, is a very kind body, who is kind of light, when he said with his body, and the animal soul is a ride for it, and it is a place in the water.The cold in the cold and the fire in the fool and the secret of the Kahbiyyan.In it, in it, then the phenomenon is that what is meant by the domination of the ritual is the way of death and the approach of the exit of the spirit of the body, the lamination of the lamination that is in the words of this To say it to the Almighty and it was said who is up to the one.
