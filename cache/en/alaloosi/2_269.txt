The Quranic researcher (P-41) The wisdom is brought out by Ibn Jarir and others from Ibn Abbas that it is known for the Qur’an, his people, his human being, his misery, and his abhorrent, and his misery, And his delay, halal, forbidden, and proverbs, and in a narration from him: jurisprudence in the Qur’an, and the same is from Qutah and the laughter and a lot of creation, and what was narrated Abbas that the prophecy can be carried on this because of what was brought out of the pierce from my father Imam, he said: The Messenger of God said: “Whoever reads the third of the Qur’an, Read the half of the Qur’an, I will be given the half of the prophecy, and whoever reads two thirds, I give the three of the prophethood, and whoever reads the Qur’an, all of it is given to all of the Qur’an, The day of the resurrection is a reciter and a thinner of every verse of the Qur’an, so that he will be rewarded for the Qur’an I wish the immortality and in the last one, "and what is meant by the readers in this news is the one who is in its abandonment, as it is what is perceived in the righteousness and the dawn, but what is meant by the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The son of Abu Hatim was delayed from Abu Al -Darada, “The rule of the Qur’an and the idea is in it” and on the authority of Mujahid: that it is the injury in the saying and the work, and in the narration of it And jurisprudence, and in the last of the knowledge that exaggerates its benefits and abandoned its affiliation, and on the authority of Ata that it is known to God Almighty, and Abu Uthaman said: And the delusion, and it was said otherwise, and in the "sea" that there are nine and ten days a saying to the people of knowledge, one of them is one of them, and some of them are more than one of them.What the said is an important individual of wisdom, otherwise it is a source of rulings, which is the perception of knowledge, work, or saying, or in it all of it, and from the fighter that it is a fighter that it is a fighter that it is a fighter.In the four directions, it is a way of the Qur’an, and the last of the wonders of the secrets, and once with knowledge and understanding, and the last of the prophecy.It was said: Perhaps the proportion of the place is what the rulings indicated in the multiplicity of the generous verse from one of the first two directions, and the meaning of its giving to the time of it Evidence and reconcile for knowledge and work with it.He who is offended from his worshipers to give it to him with the authority of his grace and his knowledge of his knowledge, as he brought you what he has shown in the face of the verse of the ruling that is the one So they sought it and accelerated to work with it and whoever is governed by the ruling for the one who is the one who is the one who is intended for the one who is the one who has the ruling on the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who has the right to the one who has the right And the appearance in the place of guaranteeing the acquisition of this appearance, and this is why it was presented before the first verb and the notice of the cause of the ruling, For the reaction and made who The conditional is an effective or a beginner, and the follower is deleted.He has given a lot of great good, as he gathered for him the best of the two households.Al -Tabrani was narrated from my father Imam, who said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Lamman said to his son: O my children, on you with the Majestic of the scholars, and hear the words of the righteous The dead is the light of the ruling, as the dead land revives the doors of the rain.He did only in two men, a man whom God Almighty has given money, so he whipped his destruction in the truth and a man whom God Almighty has given to the rule, so he will be fulfilled and he will spend it.Moses said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “God sends the servants of the servants on the Day of Resurrection, and then the scholars are distinguished, and he says: Oh, the tenth of the scholars, I have not been given to you.They went, and I forgave you.What was from you nor did I get it." This is the same as the lament of the law that the wise of the Prophet came to the wise and the prophet of the rulers.Democrats, Plato, Arsalis, and those who walked on their effects and stopped in the porch of their thoughts, for the ignorance is a lot of what they went to and what they went to He has even a lot of scholars, they were forbidden from the view in their books and inferred from that with what the Imam brought out Ahmad and Abu Ali from the hadith of Jabir.On the authority of the Messenger of God, the Messenger of God ﷺ in the sorrows of its books from the deeds to read it and increase it with knowledge of his knowledge, so he was angry, and he did not, and he said: Except my followers “and in a narration,” it is sufficient for you, as the book of God, “” and the direction of the recipient that ﷺ did not allow the seedlings of the book that he came with Moses, guidance and light in the time.The prophecy is bright and the meat of the likeness and the suspicion of the rejuvenation to it, so it is a permissibility of the preoccupation of what the disappointed of the people put it The suspicions in which there was a lot and in which the illusions were great and Islam has returned in it strange, and in the book of God, the Heavy richness of what is wrong with him, as it is not hidden from those who have the opposite of the scale.And what is mentioned only is the first of the doors [269], that is, what is preached or what is thought of in the verses except for the pure minds of the illusion of illusion Judgment and for the purification of the acquisition of their praise in this adjective Or analgesic symptoms.* * * And from the chapter on the reference in the verses: that it was comprehensive on three different agreements, the first: spending in the path of God is upset, which is spending in the king of the king on the denomination Glory be to him: Those who spend their money in the path of God as a lover etc.Hope: Those who spend their money to abide by the pleasures of God and from his representatives with a paradise who knows the destiny The other is the preference of paradise on the love, and what is more in the difference is that paradise with the coming of its entirety is that it remains in the case of the love of the love, and to affirm the signal to this On the first, he brought the rabbit, which is the one who raises from the earth, and the third: spending with God Almighty, which is from the place of the testimonies O you who believe, spend from the kindness of what you have gained and the soul is attached to this administer, and the first spending is the weakening to the seventh of the seventh, and the one is more and more And the second -to -one partial paradise for weakness; And the third of the ruling is the necessary wisdom for the struggle after the vigor, which is the great good, because it is the most important of his attributes, and the owner of this spending is still from this spending.Divine judgment and the religious sciences of the integrity of the eyes and the witnesses of the eye, and the alerts of its grace in the past, that the spending will be overwhelmed by the time and the harm is that it is the harm of the For three faces: his being is in agreement with the matter, which is the case for him on the basis of the attribution to him, and his being is a removal of the slaves of the miser He is a slightly navigator, and he is the case for him to the one who is due, so if he who accompanies him and hurts, he has lost the command of God Almighty and he came with what is meant by the rest of the one With the abuse, the aggression, the wonder, and the admiration of its act and the vision of the blessing from it, not from God Almighty, and all of them are the most bad of the miser The rumor is harmful, but not a ratio.
