The Qur’an, the Sharawi, marry the companies until the narrator of the one and others will be believed on the authority of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with him - “The Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - It is said to him: The son of Abi Murthaid is a solution to the sons of Hashem to Mecca; It was a cell in the ignorance, so when he converted to him, he was subjected to it, and she came to him, and she said: He is rubbing, O Matrad, not to leave?But if you want to marry you?Do you think?And he greeted - a background, and his knowledge, which was from his command and the matter of embrace, and what was met by her because of her And that Sayyati followed that this is not a reason for the descent of this verse, but rather it is because of the descent of the verse of the light of the adulterer who does not marry except for an adulterer or a mourning.Abbas - may God be pleased with them - that this was descended in the servant of God ibn Raawah, and he had a bad nation, and that he was angry with it, so he was blessed, then he was blessed, and then he was.May God’s prayers and peace be upon him - and he told him to tell him, and the Prophet said to him - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him And the good is good and testify that there is no god but God and that you are His Messenger, so he said: O servant of God, she is a believer, and the servant of God said: So whoever has the right to do you And he married her, so he did, and he was cursed by people from the Muslims, so they said: He was married to a nation?So God Almighty: Do not marry the verse.Many of the people of science (the companies) on the other hand, so it is permissible to marry the writings for him for his saying: He was not the one who is the one who disbelieves The people who disbelieved from the people of the book or the participants and the compassion are required.A book, and on the authority of Hammad, he said: I asked Abraham about Zawjeh Al -Hudiya and Al -Nasraniyah, so he said: No, I am not in it, so I said: Is it not God - the Almighty?He said: Those are the Mujawath and the people of the two, and some went to the fact that the writings are general His miracle and added it to others - the highest - and this is the evil with its eyes, and because the evil was located in the metaphor of faith in the aftermath, and because it is - the Almighty - His saying: The Jews, the son of the son of God, said: The Christians, the son of God, said to his saying of his grace: when they are involved, and he brought the virginity in the people of the people Ibn Umar - may God be pleased with them - was, if he was asked about the marriage of the Nazranism man or the Judaism?He said: God forbade - the Almighty - the companies on the Muslims, and I do not know anything of the angry more than the most saying that the woman says: her Lord is Jesus or a servant of the servants of God, and this is the servant of God And some of the Zaydiyyah, and made the verse of the benefits: and the fortifications of those who have given the book to be forgotten by this verse, the transcription of the year, and that is, and that is, and that is the same It is desirable, and the perpetrator is that the extension surah was not copied from it.And the Almighty said: If you come to you, then you will be among them or offer them a texture of his saying, his grace: and that he is judged between them when God has revealed and said: With his saying, I am proud of his affairs: and testify to a justice of you and the famous who is the work that the work is that this verse has been copied with what is in the place of what is necessary, The father of David was brought out in his people from Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - that he said in and do not marry the partners, we copied from that, we have the people of the book The Muslims have forbidden Muslims to their men, and for good and a jurisdiction like that, and he is the one who went to Hanafi and Al -Shafi’i The copy, and the building of the disagreement is that the shortcomings of the general words are transmitted by the Shafi’i - may God be pleased with him - and copying us.A believer nation is better than a company that is to be forbidden and a desire for the believers of the believers, it was issued in the words of the young man in the words of the division in the interest of the oath in The displacement, and the origin of (nation) (mothers), was deleted for its mother, without measuring, and it was compensated for it, and it indicates that its mother and its return in the gathering; As his saying: (P-119) As for the slave, they do not call me and if the children of the mother are called to the appearance in the source.A verb - with the eyes of the eye - or a verb - by opening it -?Say, the most prolonged seconds, and it is collected on (mother), and it is in the recipient without an illiterate, and its origin (Amao) - With two moods - the first is an increased, and the second is the fulfillment of the word, so the waw fell asleep, which was accepted by what was before it in the name of an Arab, and no And the guarantee before it is a break to advise the ya, so the name became before (gas and judge), then the second gossip turned a thousand to be a thousand, after the thunder (Am) and his Arabism as a judge, and the appearance is that what is meant by the nation is not met by the free, and the reason for the descent is supporting that; Because it is the defect on the one who marries the nation and desires in the marriage of freely, in the verse, the believing nation is preferred to the polytheism - and it is not possible The fact that the free one over it with the first way is, then the precedence requires that in the polytheism good, either it is intended to be good, and it is the best of the world It will be at the same time as the people of Paradise, and it is a good and stable and said: What is meant by (the nation) is free, whether it is or is murdered, for the people of God - and God is all of them It is carried on the dance; Because it is imperative to be able to describe the descriptions in a share, then it is estimated (nation) with the corners of the context, and the good of the nation is not redeemed, and the one who is free, and the one who is the one who is free (Free) or (a woman) was the disagreement of the phenomenon, and the masculinity in the cause of descending (the nation) after its fear.And (the nation) after the fear is free, and it is not called (nation) by adopting the salt of the universe, and the truth is that (the nation) in the sense of (the ritual) as it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the A public partner, and its universe is the disagreement of the diligence.And on the appreciation of the transcendence, it is the conjunction of the obligation, and perhaps the last of that is the first of its first and the first and the first; As it is before the dismissal of the light before the arrival to the water - and the reason for the descent is supportive, and there is no indicative of it - and it was said in it: that the servant of God is a nation - that is a nation - if it is true And a believer nation with the lightness of the tenderness and the lack of danger is better than what was described by the polytheism with its money from the honor of freedom and the raising of the matter of the time And the path of what is required of desire in it, Said bin Mansour and Ibn Majah on the authority of Ibn Omar - may God be pleased with them - on the authority of the Prophet - may God bless him - peace be upon him - The women are good, so they are good for them to want them, and do not marry them over money The grammar of the one who is more preferred.For her affection, her according to her and her debt, so they are bound by the same debt The condition, and therefore you do not need the penalty and the estimation, which are impressed, but the good and the like, and Al -Jarmi said: The waw is to kindly be able to do so Your impressive and the condition of the condition is deleted, the precedent sentence, and the satisfaction said: It is a symptom that falls on the simplicity and last The condition is with the first way to prove in all the censorship, and some of them were inferred by the verse on the permissibility of marriage (the believing nation) with the existence of the length of the freedom, The verse is the marriage of slaves, but that is to alienation from the marriage of the shared free; Because the Arabs were with their prayers, Nafrin from the marriage (the nation), then he said to them: If you repel from the nation, then the partner is first - and in which it is a reflection - and in the sea: It is permissible to marry (the nation) of the infidel (P-120) as a book or otherwise; As for the owner of the king of Yemen, it is permissible to be divorced.And do not marry the partners until they believe, that is: do not marry the infidels of the believers, whether the infidel was a writer or otherwise, and whether the believer was, or the believer, or the believers With the addition of the Ta’a, not otherwise, and the conquest cannot be able, otherwise it is obligatory: the entrusted people do not marry, and it is inferred by the conspiracy of the guardian in the marriage, and it is divorced, and it is a disagreement, and it is the disagreement That is hidden; Because what is forbidden for this verb and angels from him, and all Muslims are guardians in that.A believer servant with the humiliation of the mortgage in it is better than a partner with what is attributed to him from the glory of the money, and if you like what is in it in the references The reminders of the participants and the companies call for the fire, meaning: the infidels that lead to it is either by saying or with love and mixture, so do not meet the sake of them.The infidels call the believers to the fire, as well as those believers, they invite them to paradise in one of the two things It is harmful in the hereafter, and that it is not for the royalty of that, and it will be avoided in what is in which the invalidity, with the soul and the Satan, will be given to what leads to the fire, The ignorance of that - said by some of the investigators - and the sentence...Etc.He approaches them to paradise and forgiveness, that is, to the belief of the right and good deeds that are connected to them, and the garden is presented to the forgiveness with the forgiveness of the saying: By adherence to dissolving the elevation of the fire of the fire, in order to be attached to his ear attached to the call, that is: they call for that, and he is wrapped in the same way The believers of their relatives are good, so understand Calls to communication.And he shows his verses to people, so that they may remember 221 so that they would be preached or brought to their information, based on the knowledge of God Approval of the advice and the guidance, the waw is symptomatic or an emotion, and the verse was pronounced by thinking; Because it was for the two rulings, reconciliation, benefits, and desire in which it is the place of the mind and the evidence of the believers, the appropriateness They remember; Because it is a sacrifice for the news by calling for paradise and fire that is not a way to its knowledge except the transfer and the evidentity of all people, so it is appropriate to remember.And among the people who are estimated in the verse added; That is, the companion of God or his guardians, and they are the believers, so the additive and the evaluation of the added to him are deleted to them, and it is assumed that the one who has been said to the It is necessary to dismantle with the preacher of the preacher for that, and it is answered that the preacher was the form of this sentence, treating the good, and the precedent does not appear.Likewise, the pain appears for his saying, his grace: with his permission with that, for you are the same The interpretation of the (ears) and the matter of dismantling is easy; Because after the establishment of the place of the added to the supervision of making the first action for the second, a picture is a picture, so it is appropriate for the restrictions - as well He is the first of what was said: What is meant (and God calls) on the tongue of his Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - so that his answer is required to answer him Because, even if he is called for the reference union in the two essential sentences, but he misses the two emotions, but he misses the goodness and the goodness of the two They call for fire, as well as the roll of piety, as it is not hidden.
