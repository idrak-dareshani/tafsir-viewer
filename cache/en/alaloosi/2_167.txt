The researcher, the Qur’an, who followed if we had a hatred, that is: if we would have a return and a return to the world.So we disappeared from them, that is: from the rumors, as they innocent from us, they wish to return to the world until they obey God - the Almighty - and they will be innocent of the righteousness of them.All of them are the innovations of those who are rushed to them, in order to make them like them like them; That is, as they were made by the righteousness, they are rampant, confused about their followers, we also make them with the righteousness, who are raised, and they are confused about what happened to us.They did not seek before them before the return; Because he is angry with those who are rumored; Where they are innocent of followers or not, and from here the reader appears on the construction of the acting; Because you see the followers of those who are rumored to the hereafter with separation from them after it was revealed to them that they are their benefit, and that is not angry with the one who is not angry with those who are not I suffer from it, and so they wish to return to the world to be innocent of them to be angry with them.As for his saying of his grace: as they are innocent, it is only necessary for the contradiction from the rumors, and it is stated in another verse, and it is not necessary that it be a slander It was said: The following is the time after (they are innocent) from the rumors on the day of the resurrection, they wish the hatred to the world with their vougers, so that they can be absolved of them, and they will be broken from them.They have the humiliation of the world and the hereafter, and this is needed to declare the assumption in (for us), meaning: for us and them; It is innocent in the world, but it is imagined if it returns both of the two sects.Likewise, in the position of the divorced, on the authority of what is after him, and the referred to the concepts of the concepts from when they see any: like the opinions of the torment that is the same The reasons are cut off, and the return wished.God gives them their business, and it is permissible for them to be the one who is the concept of the concept, after that, and the adherent to the reference to what the reference is not.And the place of the monument on the source also; That is, that fantastic opinions, they see them at the same time.And their torment, and it is permissible for you to be numerical, as if he had been overwhelmed in their Eid and expressed their torment, it was a place that he repeated the one who asked the one who asked the one who asked the one who asked the one who is the one who asked the one who asked the poison Who is torment or did it take place?He answered what you see, and (sorrows), that is, a demolition, which is a third effective to see if the vision is a heart, and it is from (their business) if it is in Basra, Participants (their business) are the day of the Day of Resurrection (the sorrows) of its vision, which is underwear in a book that does not leave a young or old, unless he counted it, and the reward of the reward is not.They regret what they have been exhausted on the sides of God, And they have a row of severity and the permissibility of its attachment to the addition of the added; That is: their discharge; Because (a decrease) exceeded (Ali) and inferred from the verse who went to the fact that the infidels are addressed by the vocabulary and what they are out of the fire, 167, who is alienated in the people of the To him, we are against and what I am (P-37) by chasing those who believe, and what you are with us, dear, so I have a sign of the enemy of the people of the believers who are among the people who say: Lover for God in the fire, and if I want from (those who wronged) the infidels are divorced without the polytheists, then the confinement was a realistic, and it is the one who is the one who is the one They do not share them in the immortality other than them, because the polytheism deems the punishment, and it was said: The intended is the denying the origin of the verb; Because he is the one who is the one with the standing of the return, not the limitation of the negation; As the shrine is not a denominator and a conflict that the outside or others are on the part of the rhetoric, and if it is correct, by looking at the stick, except that it is the one who is in the way, except that it is a matter The immortality and the cultivation of the salvation, the return to the world, and the increase of (B) and the delay of their self from the meter The addressee did not remain in it, so that the oppression of some verses remains the same as the will of limitation, and from that the Almighty saying: They want to come out of the fire It is not the saying that the life of the exclusivity is a text in the retirement, as it was worn.* * * And from the chapter on indication in the verses, the description, that is, the pure spirit of the dar of the violations and the bitterness, meaning: the soul that is based on the service of its inclination from the flags of the religion of God, He attained the position of the same one, and entered the divine presence with the nose of the same or visited the presence of the attributes of the attributes, and it is fraudulent, and it is the righteous, and the righteousness of the majest Then, it is toured with them and returns to their place with the struggle of the divesty after the so -called alienation, and whoever raises the best of the knowledge and the knowledge of the The guideline, for God thank his work and know his reward, for those who assure what we have left for them from the lights of knowledge and the guidance of what is in the way Their minds of the light of the follower, those who are excluded by God - the Almighty - and the veil of them from it and cursing them who are the one who is the highest Those who are used to do not accompany them, except those who returned to God - exalted - and know that what they are in it is absent from it - glory and exalted -, and they are good, and they will be blessed with them With the sincerity of the treatment, those are accepted by their repentance and I am the merciful repentance.Those who disbelieved and responded to the truth, and they remained on their admiration until they are still in their power And the light of their innocence, those of those who achieved the parcel and the distance from the right and the world of king He has them, nor do they look at the obligation of these grievances of darkness, and your God is one of the same soul The heavens of the souls, the land of the souls, and the disagreement of the light and the darkness between them, and the body of the body that runs in the sea of ​​the seed in the number They raised them, and what God has descended from the sky of the water from the water, so they revived the land of the soul after its death in the ignorance, and the bodies of the bonds were broadcast in it.The rocks, and the script of the winds of the movement of the movement of the tree of the tree in the hearts of the hearts and the clouds of the laughing manifestations between the sky of the soul and the land of the soul.The discourse is on the fire of the door, to hold an hour of the burning of the fire of excess of the verses and evidence of people who are reasonable with the mind of the light On the authority of the delusion, and from the people who worship from God, things that prevented him from the servitude of his master and the guidance to him, they love them and they will love them, and they will love them, and they will love them, and they will love them.And they settle between them and between him - Glory be to him -; Because they did not taste the pleasure of his love, and they did not see the light of his witnesses, the entitlements of his and his prayers and his closeness, and those who believe in the full faith are more severe for God; Because they are exposed to their witnesses, they are greeted with his speech from the covenant of your Lord, you will not be satisfied with it, and it is not the same, so it is the same.Or it tends to go to their core, and they loved him with his love, and their hearts became the throne of his manifestations and his closeness.And if he see those who have been wronged and share who is in the truth, there is nothing, nor alive, nor for me at the time of their vision, the torment of the admiration for the Lord of the Lords, and that the power is for the sake of God.For their gods, who are for them from him, to grow and be able; Where they did not mean the face of God - the Almighty - and they did not ask for it, and when the rhetoric of those who are prestigious and those who have seen the torment of the forbidden, they have seen the torment It was among them in the world, and they could not be able to be with the world, and also the state of the spiritual powers of the pure power of the power of the people in the power of the people Its self, and my blessing is for those who love in God - the Almighty, may God bless him -.
