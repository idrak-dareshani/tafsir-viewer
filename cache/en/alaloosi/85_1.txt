The Quranic researcher Al -Baraj, there is no disagreement in its place, nor in its two, two and twelve verses, and the face of its appropriateness for what was accepted by it by its insults like the one who kissed it and the one who came to the one who came before it (P-85) And the return of the disbelievers with the intensity of the Qur’an and the luxury of its destiny.And in the sea that he gave it to him when he mentioned that he was glorified and exalted, he knows what they are all for the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him Like crushing, killing, crucifixion, and burning with suns and the warmth of rocks, and put the bodies of those who want to be fascinated It was presented from the nations, and they were tortured by the fire, and that the tormenting was the same as steadfastness in faith.Those who tortured the believers from the disbelievers of the Quraysh, so this surah is a bone for Quraysh, and it is proven to those who are tormented by the one who is the one who is the ones In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and the Heaven with the Burns, that is, the shortcomings, as Ibn Abbas said and others, and what is meant by it is at the gathering of the rituals of the righteous, Dahir and then became a right to the high palace because it is an appearance of the views, and it is said that it is beneficial from the wall of the city as well and the promoters With the truth, it is in the origin of a slogan, as it is likened to the shortcomings because of perhaps it is because the stars are descended in it as their housing, so there is a liking, and it is an explicit.It was said: The sky likened the city's walls, and the brokers were proven, and it was said: It is the homes of the moon, and this is returned to the first saying; Because the outposts are divided into eighties and twelve homes, and the words may be presented in it.Mujahid, Al -Hassan, Akarmah and Qatada said: It is the stars.Ibn Mardawi narrated from Jabir ibn Abdullah, may God be pleased with him, in which he had a hadith in which he was spoken by the words of the curtains, with the sake of the stars.Ibn al -Mundhir and Abd ibn Hamid came out on the authority of Abu Salih that he said: These are the great stars, and on it, but it was named by the brows of its appearance, and so on what happened to it The appearance, and the inclusiveness of all the stars appeared, and it was said: It is the doors of the sky and was called that because the balance is brought out of the angels, so the peace be upon them, so it is from them.With the shortcomings of the greatness, or their matter from it, or because it is because it is a principle for the back, and it was described as a metaphor in the dispute, and it was said in the lineage and the righteousness in the righteousness in the righteousness of the rituals in the lineage, and the rituals of the rituals in the lineage and the rituals in the wise and the rituals in the rituals of the rituals in the wiping and the righteousness On what was mentioned by the people of the body, which is considered in the upper orientation of the threshold of the threshold of the threshold of the larger, and they claimed that the throne is for the sake of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same A sense of what they had to do The argument of the highest ark of the known pictures, such as bearing and brightness, and others, which are in the eighth kingdom called upon them with the roots of the rewards and the rituals of the sake of the good So the lamb is like a part of the twelve part of the upper king That is the mourning of the revolution, from that time, and so, but it was said that the time was divided, because every image has come out of its movement, even if it was a mantle, and if it was, it was a mantle.He has from those outstanding until the lamb was almost forgiven the ritual of the revolution and the rituals of the rituals The homes were said: What is meant by the sky is the upper astronomy, and the eighth astronomy was said to the appearance of the pictures indicating the brows in it, and therefore it is called, so you have the rugs.It was said: The worldly sky because it is seen in it with the vicinity of the sense, as it was said in the saying of the Almighty: and the worldly sky has decorated us with the sacrifice of the sacrifice of the sake The heavens are a dryness, so the high appears in it in the lower it is because it is seen in it backward, and if I want the stars the stars, then it was said: What is meant by the eight eight of the eight; Because it is a truth in it, and it was said: the worldly sky and it was said: the gender is against what has passed and it is not intended to what was said by the larger astronomy, meaning the highest astronomy; Because it is his name, it is not accompanied, and if the doors want it, then it is said: What is meant by the heavens is nothing but for you, for you, the one who is named for the sake of the ritual, for the sake of the ritual, for it is that it is for the time of it You know that more than what is mentioned in the words of the people of the advanced body, and he is not valid for him, and he is almost not heard in it, and he is almost listening to it, But when some of the Islamists heard (P-86) of the philosophy, nine wrestling and wanted to disturb this on what was narrated on the trips, and the seventh of it is the seventh of it, and the seventh of it is the seventh of it, and the seventh of it is the seventh, The rest are the Karsi and the throne, and it did not know that in the news, what refuses to do so, and the mind of the mind is required by a search, as it is not hidden.And whoever returns to the words of the people of the updated body and looks at their evidence of what they said about the matter of the heights and how to make it strong, and it is a strong one of it Those who are presented in that; So who is said to be said: The brokers are the homes of the crying, divorced, which is witnessed by the properties and the phases, and what we have in any heavens, or the crying, is whose souls were not.The uniqueness in the tongue of the law and the authentic hadiths, and it is for every heaven, and it has not been proven to the throne or the chairman from it and is intended by the sky of its gender or the heavens in the heavens in the heaven.The last of what you heard as you came, so do not be forgiven.
