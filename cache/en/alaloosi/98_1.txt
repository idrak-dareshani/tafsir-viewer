The Qur’anic researcher is called the Surah of the Resurrection, the Surda of the Country, the Wall of the Anfactors, the Buriyah Wall and the Surah was not.He said in the sea: an angel in the saying of the fans.Ibn al -Zubayr and Ata ibn Yasar said: a civilian said by Ibn Attiyah, and in the book of liberation is a civilian, which is the saying of the jam, and the father of Salih narrated from the authority of the son And his choice is Yahya Bin Salam.I finish.Ibn al -Faris said: The most famous is that it is an angel, and Ibn Maridi narrated it from Aisha and the son of Ibn Katheer by that it is a civilian, and he was inferred from the one who is in the authority of the imam.Mujam Al -Sahaba and Al -Tabrani and Ibn Mardawi on the authority of Abu Khaytah Al -Badiri, he said: “When I descended: I was not those who disbelieved from the people of the book to the last of it, he said: The Messenger of God, your Lord commands you to read it as a father.The Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said I read this surah.This is the most correct.Which is nine in Al -Basri and a trustworthy.It came in its virtue what Abu Musa al -Muddi has taken out in the knowledge of the name of the son of Abu Hakim on the authority of Mutar al -Mazeni or the civilian on the authority of the Prophet, peace be upon him.He hears a reader that was not the one who disbelieved, and he says: I preach my servant, so my dear, I do not ask you in a state of worldly and the last of the world.And its appropriate appeals, as he accepted that he said, was the Almighty in it: it was not the one who was etc.Like the reason for the removal of the Qur’an as if it was said: “We” revealed it; Because those who disbelieved were not disbelieved from their disbelief until a messenger who recites a cleansed newspapers come to them, and that is the descendant; Do not be forgiven.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the people of the book were not disbelievers, that is, the Jews and the Christians, and their reference to that address was said to the greatness With the reason for what we have been attributed to them from the promise to follow the truth, then it is the rest of that and their emotions for him in their writers, and it is based on the face of God.And the revenue of the prayer is a verb, because their disbelief is a hearing after their prophets, peace be upon them, in the attributes of God, glorified and glorified, and from the blame, as he said: Mataredi in the interpretations, not for the two disciplines, because one of them did not disbelieve after his Prophet, and it was the right to the right until God died of the Almighty, and the Almighty died, It was said: They were before the truth before the mission of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.And he supported the will of Al -Tahbida with what was narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, that what is meant by the people of the book is the Juda who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the Qanqa, and some said: We do not surrender that the two disciplines requires the disbelief of all of them before the resurrection, so that it is that the absence of them is the same The mission is as if it was said: This was not the infidelity and showed the people of the book.And the participants, who are those who believed in God, are a category or otherwise, and some of them were subjected to the slave of idols, because the two Arabs who are the ones who are in the mind and what are the ones who are not.They are the ones who are intended here on what was narrated from the ink.Whatever it was, kindness is on the people of the book, and it is not obligatory for the metaphor that some of them will not be disbelievers so that the aggressors must be obligatory for the two people; Because they are some of the group, as some of the deadline benefited him.And it is intended to be intended by the partners, the people of the book and their partnership of their saying, the son of God, and the son of God, may God Almighty blessed.And compassion for the enemy of the address is nothing.It was read: “And the partners” by raising the elevation of the communication, and carrying the readers ’readings on (PVI) that and it is considered that the neighbor of the neighborhood does not hide its condition.And the neighbor and the boundaries are in the position of the situation from the guarantee of (disbelievers) and its saying is the Almighty: the dismantling of the news of the news, and the jaws in the origin of the domain of the mammals of the mortality, And I want the separation for what they had to do with what you will know if God Almighty wills.Some grammarians claimed that it was described from it, and the news is deleted; That is, the promise of following the right or as part of it.And it is followed with his being the disagreement of the phenomenon that it was news and its siblings is not permissible to delete it at the capacity, not to limit it, and when it is not a milestone; That is, in the world is a damage.And the saying of the Almighty: until the evidence comes to them, attached to the pests and the evidence is a row in the sense of the name of the subject, that is, the indicated of the truth or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the right The prosecutor is stabilized, and the miracle is intended and on the two.
