The Quranic researcher who eat usury, that is, they take it, so that the paths of the integrity are brought in, and the expression of it is eating because it is the greatest of what is meant in it.Their saying: The Lord of the thing is raised if it increases, and in the law a phrase for the grace of money that is not met by compensation in the paid of money with money, but it is written by the one who is like the prayer The thousands of the thousand will be clouded after it, similar to the gathering of the collection, and the word became the same as the meaning of the meaning in the universe of each of them.The interests of the purposeful letters, which is the thousand, caused the memorial that is similar to it, and it is the collection, where it increases the thousand, as it takes the meaning The sale of the two meanings of the two meanings of money is not satisfied with the money, and if one of the rituals is more than more, and it was said: Writing with Waww and the thousand, because it is not for the one who is not.Prayer and zakat are written with them, so that it will not be in the thought of the confusion in the collection, and the female said: They learned the line from the people of the life, and they are a tuning of their Lord He wrote like that, and this is the opinion of the Basri, and the Kufic permitted his writers, as well as his praise for the sake of the break that is in his first, and he said: They do not stand up to the day of resurrection, and it is a reciter, as in the “elderly spread” (P-49) except as it is the one whom the Satan is disturbed, that is, it is only as a resurrection, such as the resurrection of the one The world, and the confusion is active in the sense of action and its origin is a beating, and it is tilted on different parts of it.Likewise, from what the effects were brought up, the Tabrani was brought out from Awf ibn Malik, he said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Do you and the sins that are not forgiven.On the day of resurrection, and the eaters of usury, for the eaten of usury, the day of the resurrection is a madman who is hiding.He made a mark for him to be known to him on the day of the Great Grandum of him, as he made for some obedients a matter of which he will be able This nation sends the day of resurrection, and those who are excused from the effects of ablution, and to this, the son of Abbas and Ibn Mas'oud, and the deceased, said: Attiyah: What is meant is that the one who is alive in his urgency and moves it in its acquisition in the world with the hurried disappointed, as it is said to those who will be exhausted with the sacrifice of the sacrifice, and no It is hidden that it is a path for the nation’s predecessor, and it is narrated from the Messenger of God ﷺ from a reason only the one who is not considered in the same way.It is said: The man is touched.With the child, he called it because the Satan has touched the man and his mixtures is prepared for corruption, so he spoils and the madness occurs, and this does not contradict what is the one who is mentioned The prevalence of the time of the wicked, because what it mentioned is the reason for a relative and what the verse refers to the reason for a distant and not with a ritual as well, but rather, and there is no opposite, so it is not possible.As if the mood is strong and it may get a madness and did not get a touch, as if the mood is clogged without the displays of a foreigner, and the madness that has the touches has come to the time Those who are subjected to the emirates they know about, and it may enter some of the bodies on some of the synagogues with a wind that is stuck in it On the fullness of the face and perhaps that steam on the senses and disrupted it, and that the spirit of the fabricated spirit was transmitted with the behavior, so it is spoken, and it is not.I did not feel a feeling of the person with something from that origin, and this is like a sensual testimony that is almost considered an affirmative of the denial of the witnesses.Al -Mu'tazila and Al -Qafal said from the Shafi’i: The color of the ritual and the madness of the Satan is false; Because he is not able to do so as he said a story about him: I would not have the authority of the verse and (what) here is and he responds to what the Arabs claimed and imitated that they are So he will be cursed and that the gin is touched by it, so his mind is confused, and there is no truth for that, and there is nothing but that it is from the Satan with his words, and from his words, and from his saying The law, he has responded and responded, “There is no money that is born except for the Satan, and it is not shouted.” Maryam and her son to say her mother: I have her darkening with you and her offspring from the ritual Satan and his saying ﷺ: And he responded in the hadith of the Muqaqid, which was chosen by the demons, and his response was in his time, peace and blessings be upon him, that he had spoken of his affairs with them, he said: A distress, so I am hidden from his fear, "to the other than that of the effects, and in" the snapshots of the bonds in the rulings of the elves "many of them, and the sake of the predecessor and the people of the Sunnah that is not the same Fact and satellite matters as the law is informed of it, and the obligation to be paid all of them is obligatory for a long way that is inclined to it except for the one who is the one who is the one who is the same And the like they came out of the barriers of the law, so they warned them, God killed them, that I am reluctant, and the verse that they mentioned in the exposure of the cursing of them is not upon them The exile in it is (P-50) is the oppression and the way to follow it, not to be exposed to harm and confrontation for what he gets With the reason for destruction, and whoever follows the news of the prophet and the many are found from it, a lord of the palace and the fall of that from the Satan, but rather it is the verb of the verb.Your enemies are the elders of that, and some of our elders who are delayed are done on the part of what we have carried on the question of the question and the touches, if he said: A special abuse of consumption and formation of mixture and formation, which is excreted from it and the sides of the remaining parts that remain on its air or a conversing with a fierce part And a fantastic spirit is attached to it that it is caused by the stray, and that is a type of gin, so it is what is known in the words of life, alive, and unnoticed bodies; Either it is the majority of the air or the fire, and it has the types of minds and other minds, and they are formed.His enforcement, or stabbed and stabbed himself with him, in which he will obtain in it according to what is in that evil from the heated power and what is in the person who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the most effect The ordinary in the causes is a hard -working mother who is a dominant dominant for the seamless and the pimples in the most of the causes of its corruption of the usual mood, and this is the one in this.The door, which is a good achievement that we did not find for others, as we did not find what we achieved in the affair of the touch for anyone but us.And the neighbor and the mourning are attached to what was accepted by the act that is based on the fact that what came before (except) is working as soon The one who has a food, or by (stands), or (is hiding it).(That) referring to the most or to what they descended from the torment that they said, but the sale is the same as usury.The values ​​of their dirhams with their dirhams, the sale of their dirhams with two dirhams, except that they made usury origin in the solution and likened to the sale of it in the way of it.الم His voracity is a dusty, as if (his land is his sky) and it was said: It is permissible that the analogy will be unaware of what is based on what he understood For the sake of gaining and increasing, and that is in usury, and otherwise, it is forbidden.God has permitted the sale and deprived usury a rhetorical sentence from God, the Almighty, in response It is from the work of the Satan that between the two chapters separately, which is that whoever sold a garment equals their dirhams with their own ones, then the garment was made, and it is not for them, so there is no time The intercourse of something of the garment, and if he sold their dirhams with two dirhams, then the excessive darkel took a muddy, and it is not possible With the fullness of the money, it was said: The difference between them is that one of the two dirhams in the second is lost, and in the first, it is forced with the basis of the need for the sake of the authority, It was permissible for the sentence to be from the fulfillment of the words of the disbelievers as a denial of the legitimacy and a response to it, that is, the same as the difference between the similarities, and it is not for the sake A state, and in it is estimated and it is not hidden that it is from the distance in a place, and the public is the general of sale and usury in every sale and in every god but what the evidence is from Some of the usury, and it was said: They are beautiful, so it is not presented to the solution of a sold and does not forbid a Lord except with two chains, and he will support him of what the Imam and son of the Imam and son of Ibn The speech, may God be pleased with him, said that he said: From the last of what was revealed by the verse of usury and that the Messenger of God ﷺ was arrested before he was interpreted by us, so they called us the Lord.Whoever comes to him is a preaching, that is, whoever has attained him and is a preacher, like the forbidding of usury and its abuse, and (who) (P-51) is a condition or a connection, and a preacher, and a preacher came to the For the separation and the inheritance of a metaphor with what is in the preacher, meaning from the memory, and read Aby and Al -Hassan (came to him) with the right of the Lord, from his Lord, from his Lord, from his Lord, from his Lord) With a deletion of a description of a sermon and the two estimates in which there is a greatness for its affliction and in the remembrance of the Lord, it is a humiliation of the acceptance of the rhetoric, then it is a note.His servant and (from) to call the end or to the overflow and the additive was deleted.The prohibition is not mentioned from it, and this is the narrator of Al -Baqir and Saeed bin Jabir, and it was said: What is meant is not taken from him in the world, nor in the hereafter, in the last of what he takes Before, and the fulfillment is either for the answer or a link in the news, and (what) is in the position of lifting with the kindness if it was made (who) is connected, and with the rejection of if it was made of my condition The bonds are involved, and the time of the mark is the name of an event, and whoever does not involve them is permissible as his being, the perpetrator of the disobedience and his command, that is, the end of the time, then the end of the time.From the usury, he did not do, and if he wanted, he did not do, and it was said: What is meant is that he is rewarded for his end, if it is for the acceptance of the preaching and the righteousness What you want, there is no symptom for you.Among the people who made the bishop the bitter of what was preceded or for the goddess, both of them are the disagreement of the phenomenon.And whoever returns to what he returned to the premature reaction of the usury and the intention of his permissibility and the urbanization of his head on the sale, then you are a sign of the one who returned to the one who returned to the one who returned and the gathering They are in it, they are immortal.And made Al -Zamakhshari is attached to the usurc, so he will be inferred by the verse on the goodness of the majority of the great The immortality if he made a reward for the starlets, the rest of the actual passed from the verb, other than the abuse of the words, in the first place, in the first place, not a phrase, or a sign, or a sign of it.With the difference of what if this is made of the reward of the verb, then the intended is a wild reminder with his statement, the reward of the chains, and that it is a matter He disbelieves his muddam, and it is only for the sacrifice of the forbidden and its reward is known, and therefore he was not alerted to it for his appearance, and some of the investigators said: The worse was the one who is mentioned from the graves to the stand and enough for it, then it was told that their bearer was on the height of this saying, so I felt the first one that was the first They mentioned the obligation of their departure, and it was referred to that it was a feast of every eating whether it was pregnant with that saying or not.As for his saying of his grace: Whoever comes to him is a preaching from his Lord, then he ended up and said: He who returns, then he is in the one who is believed, and if he made a sign of the resurrection of the one who is the same The verb to the saying is that if he had no income in the torture, it was not improved in the exposure of the return, and the saying is that the attached to the Lord is the one The disagreement of the phenomenon, and it is managed.
