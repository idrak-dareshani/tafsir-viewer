is not for the sake of the rest In our presence after, and whoever gave something to something, or he assumed it to him, or noticed his prayers, he crossed it with that, because he is a separation from him, or he is in his separation, Not in your hand.And when this meaning did not come in the words of the Almighty: this is a book that we descended because it is a sign of what it has, and they did not come with that with that with the distance In the first, and it is cut off by the letters, and it is only in our right, and its remembrance is in the second, and if the two residences differed, and the two references were separated as the two signs said, and it is the one who said it.You are investigating, and guided you to what I have with me, a thick look, and the most distant from them, and the distance directed that the Qur’an is noticeable, and it is from the rituals of the symptoms, the symptoms of the righteous, It was found from it, and it was faded, and it became absent from the sense, and what is the same in the judgment of the far, and it was said: Because the form of the distant and the proximity is like it.The story of Jesus, peace be upon him: that we call upon you and then he said: This is the truth of the truth and has the paths of the generous book, and the transmission of the Jerjani, and the one who said: He has the glimpse of his teeth, his affection is a fear of a fear that I am so and no text, so that it is that I want to be that I am the one that I was, and I am heard of it, Imam Al -Razi: That is for a distance, not a place, so he carried it here on the requirement of the linguistic position, not the knowledgeable, contrary to what we understand from the book, And according to each knowledgeable knowledge, and saying that the sign is to the mourning and the evangelization as it was transmitted from Akrama, if it was mentioned in it a authentic hadith in it We accepted it and cost us to it, otherwise we will be struck by the whims, and all the impersonation is met, and the strangeness of what we have seen in the reference is that it is to the path (P-106) as the one who is in the way They asked the guidance to that it was said to them: That is the path that you asked the guidance to it, it is the book, and this is if you accept it, it will be shown in it.I complete a face, and the sign is to what has been mentioned, and the ears offered to him that it is a sign of the Qur’an, and the distance was directed by what the owner of the conquest mentioned, The one who is considered in the names of the sign is the sensual signal that is not imagined its consequences except with a witnessed sense, so I refer to it to what the sense of your sense is that you are.To a sense of no longer, like that of paradise), let him fly like the viewer, and download the mentality of the sense of al -Hasiyah, as is the same as the one who is satisfied.On the authority of Tafif, and the saying of each other: The name of the sign if it is with him is a row for him, it is not necessary to be a sense, and they are a sense, and the book is like the book, On the boundaries, such as the dress in the sense of the milk, and the books as the ritual said, an advent to an advent with a thickness, and in the jurisdiction, the forefathers are in the end of the forefathers, and some of them are in the end, In line,

and it is released on the organizer before it is necessary to organize it from the ware of it.It is called with what is affected by it with the appropriateness, and the imam said: I derive the book from the books of the thing if I gathered it and called the katibah to the book of it.Like the jokes on the people of the youth, or because it gathered in it all the sciences, or because God is the highest in which the crown is obligatory in the creation, as is the words The book is like the Qur’an on the whole group on the messenger of the messengers ﷺ and on the wonderful destiny between all and part, and he does not need here to what was said in the payment of the darkening The deaf, and I do not see in it a bad, if you take it, and the blame in the book for the truth, the same in it in:

downloaded), and the suspicion, and the origin of it is the source He gets the path of the soul, and it is the worry of the soul, and it is the Lord of time for its deputies, so it is what was transferred from the anxiety to what it is in it, and it is used for what is also from what is in it.The anger, and the saying of Imam Al -Razi: These two may refer to the meaning of suspicion, because what is afraid of the tunnels is an inner It is a reasonable person who is his response.A more between my rabbit, and my Lord, and he said: Rabni from a so -and -so, if you are in order to be

some teams between the Lord, and the doubt, that the Lord is a doubt with the one who is a suspicion, and he said: The soul is between two things, two things, where one of them is not likely to be at the end of the other, and the frequency of the opposite is the opposite, and it is required of the ritual To be dirham, and the Lord is to be deluded in the thing, then he will reveal what he deludes in it, and Al -Jawli said: The suspicion is said to what is equal to it, or for the one who did not It is one of them for the argument of the appearance that the affairs are based on, and the Lord is not for what was not reached by the grace The indication is that there is no doubt about doubt, and he denied the grace of the Lord in it with the many of those who are affiliated - not the most of them, the most important of God - And the wetness of the betting, in which the sane person does not see after the view (P-107) in his being and alive from God Almighty, not that he does not know in it until he is not correct, and he is not correct On the authority of some of the homes of the number of what it removes, and it was said: He is on the authority, as if he said: There is no doubt about it, because the causes that are required in the words and the words that are required in the words And the contradiction and the virtue of the bare of the proof, and all of that is average of the book of God Almighty, and it was said: It is forbidden, and if it is noticeable, it is not a news, so do not come to him, and do not So, it was said: It is with it, there is no doubt in it for the righteous, so the custody is a row and the righteous is a news, and this is a state It is guided, and it is a state of necessity, so the resting of the Lord is beneficial in all the Azniyah and the diligence, and the piety will be like a sign of the abandonment of the Lord, and (no) (no) (no) (no) (no) (no) (no) to the With the news, not to the exile of the name of the name, so do not turn to it to take the meaning.Tells, Rather, he did not say that he has no doubt, in which there is no one in which there is a pupil because the adherence is to feel what is far from what is meant, and it is a book other than the one who is in it, as it is in it.The wine of paradise is preferred on the wake of the world that it does not seduce the minds as it seduces it, so there is no other than the defect, and the time is not for them, and the time is not, In the house, a man, and a man is not in the house, until the father of Hayyan denied the testimony of the informing of the news here is the confusion, which is what I did not turn to, and he reads the father In it) by lifting, and it is for him to be an offense for a Lord in which he is, and it is an assumed because it is an evidence of an individual, and his denial is beneficial to his loyalty, so it is not necessary for it, so it is not necessary The famous, and this is permissible.The famous, and on it the book is its own guidance, and that was repeated that in the download, and from the slope of the bid and the endowment of the stand on the authority of the He made no doubt in the sense of really, so the stand is complete, except that it is also without the first, and the son of Katheer (in it) was read by the authority of the distraction, and for all of you Before her is a hook, if it was before it, it is not the same as the ya, and it will come to it, and it is agreed with it in it in which it is insulted, and I will find it, and I will pray it, and the rest is not, and the rest is not The most listened to him, and he read Al -Zuhri, and Ibn Jandab to add distraction from the creatures in all the Qur’an at the original, and the guidance in the original is a source of guidance, or a compensation for the one Sibuyeh, and he did not come from the sources with this adultery except for a little, such as the righteousness, the secrets, and the crying in the palace in a language, and it was watered as the Shatby said: I increase ∗∗∗ Hamd, who gave you a dream or a mind, and what is meant by it is the name of the actor with one of the well -known face When Al -Lahyani, and the sons of a lion who are feminine as he said, he said, so it is like guidance, and its meanings may be presented, and in the scouts it is the connotation that is connected to the prostitute, The first is the misguidance in his interview as it is in his words of exaltation: for this guidance or in misguidance, and the misguidance is a dilemma of the disappointment, and the number of al -Wasli to al -Bagha, so if it is not in the way, so if it is not.The concept of guidance was not met for the palace of pleasure between them, and the second is that it is said: a Mahdi in the position of the praise as well That is, he knew that the receipt is considered in his concept, and the third is that a folded guidance is a guidance, and he will not be the one who is in the light of the meaning of his origin, not to see it to the one, for it, so that it is not.Research, but first because the masculine The intercourse of delusion is the guidance that is necessary in the sense of the fulfillment, a metaphor or an integrity, and our words in the aggressor and its opposite are the misguidance, and I do not refer to it, as it is perhaps the same And it does not make it lost, if it was easy for the guidance to divorce the significance on what the receipt is, or not, and the abnormal misguidance was interpreted With the end of that absolute connotation, it is necessary for it to be the same, because the negligence of the divorced connotation is a negative of the restriction, as the negativeness of the whole is the one who is the same This interview is what the claim is likely, and secondly, we do not recognize that the misguidance is a phrase of the disappointment (P-108) etc., but it is the enemy of the ritual that is connected to the ritual of the ritual Explanation of the significance on the connected way, the blessings of the connection to the prostitute are necessary for misguidance, and it is permissible for the obligation to be a blessings, and the third is not for a third The release of the Mahdi except for the guidance to be the one who is considered an adept in the concept of guidance, for the dominance of those who are derived in an individual concept that is derived from it That he was a folded guidance, but he is before his command, so he came up, from the arrangement of a verb that will help the first, for the meaning of his guidance, so he turned his way to the ritual of the ritual.It is said: He guided him, so he did not guarantee that a group is used to them.The one who has the origin is its origin, and it is obligatory for it, and its words are supported by the Almighty: and we are not sent by the verses except for the fear of his saying, and they are not over.The fear of fear was found, and it is not said: I broken it, so it is broken, and the difference between them is detailed in the wedding of the wedding, and as for the fifth, then it is not the same.The guidance, and there is no prayer in it, and it has passed through it, and for this they disagreed: Is it a truth in the absolute connotation of a metaphor, or it is, or it is not Between them, or an exhibition of subscribed destiny?And to every sectarianism, it was said: The mentioned in the words of the Ash'ari is that the deceased has what was mentioned in the scouts, and when the disgraced is what we mentioned, and the one is the opposite, the reflection is the opposite.The words of the Ash'ari in the legal sense, and the famous, is based on the linguistic meaning, or the wedding, and the choice of the owner of the scout is scratched with the release The phenomenon in the Shari’ite Qur’an, the appearance of the successor is the opposite of this success, and the right to the people of the truth is that the guidance is the one who is blessed with the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is blessed.The integrity of the property, and with it a lot of the saying and the gossip, and (the righteous) a gathering is a righteous name that is active from its remaining, so it is upset, so it is not, and the righteousness is a language Site is divorced, and a sacrifice of the woman himself is not harmful to the hereafter, and the traits are numerous for the number of times the paths, so the eagerness of the evil is from the evil of the evil Al -Kubaire, and among them is the righteousness of the listeners, and the third is what was indicated to him by what the Termahi narrated from it ﷺ: “(The servant does not reach it to be from the one who is the one who does not Be careful with what it has with a bad), “And in this arrogance it is considered that the listening is left, and therefore it was said: ؎ Sonior sins are great ∗∗∗ and their young, so it is the one who is the one who is so good.Thorns warn what he sees, no young, ∗∗∗ The mountains are from the stones, and in this path, the terms of the old people have disappeared, and it is said: The piety is that you do not see you.Where it is your command, and it was said: The rhetoric is about the power and the power, and it was said: It is removed from everything that occupies the secret of the truth, and in this field, the people of the lover, and the people of the lover, The wakelings until he said: “And if you were dangerous for me, I would have a sacrifice in my mind.If I want to be a guidance for those who are righteous, he will be guided by them to get the first arrangement, so what is meant by those who seek to do is met with the sacrifice The Arabization of this is for the brevity, and the export of the honorable surah with the male of its loyalty, and the disturbance of their affairs, and the consultation of the way to the way of the way, to the way of the way, It is not contradictory to the goodness of the one who believes, because that is as it was said by the look at the time of the time of the proof of that proportions, as it is said: the killing of the killing of it, Perhaps the ability was made: they are those who are in the answer: Who are the righteous?And the pregnancy of everyone (P-109) is the burden of the righteous, and the righteous may be said to be met with the drying, and the adjective is a nomination without a dryness, and it is not permissible, as it is, as it is, as it is, as it is, as it is, as it is, as it is We say: He is at the same time as our Prophet Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, the day of the mosque, then there is no disturbance, and if I want him to guide him, he will be guided by the brother If you mean the righteous who are the first of the righteous, the truth is appointed, and if one of the two righteous, the two of the two classes is concerned with them.With his upcoming guidance, and the case between the second and third paths, if I want the guidance of guidance to the acquisition of the third, the third of the people, for the third The second arrangement appointed the truth, and if they mean to them the people of the third, the third of the metaphor, and the guidance is noticed in all the ritual They are guided by their confirmation of what they are on, and their guidance to the increase in it in which it is a concept within the useful sense In it, it is a metaphor, not a referral, and the emancipation is a truth in every case, such as his right to the two rumors, and whoever knows what is said: It was interpreted with the connected sign, it is necessary that it be a guidance for the righteous, indicating the fact that the hackers are obtained, as if it was said: a sign of connection to the one who is a source, to the one who is the one who is connected to the one, to the one who is in connection with the one who is connected to the one, And if it was interpreted with what is connected, there was other warnings, for the one who guides to his intention will be his significance on what he brought to him The impulsion is back, but some investigators achieved that the appearance is that there is no need for permissibility here, because if it is said: the weapon is a silence, and it is a silence, and it is a silence, and it is a silence, In the sense of our wealth and its deafness, it was not necessary for the weapon and the money that the grace and the heavy richness of it, without what they are in it, then what we are in it, so what we are in it, so what we are in it, And there is no metaphor in anything, as the righteous is guided by this guidance in fact, and the people of the Arabian and the origins in the derivative description were disagreed, is it the right to the right?Is the time the time of the proportions or the spoke of a medium between them?And those who are fulfilled that the time of the lineage, and the sake of the captain and the Kurmani went to the fact that “whoever kills a dead person has his negligence)” It is not useful for the misfortune of killing to kill him, because the purpose of the ping is with the help of the mental century that the killing of this is the one who is clear from this As it was said: He did not share it in it otherwise, so he called him without him, and from here he was made the meaning while we are in it: there is no guidance for the sake of God The pearls are the light of his guidance, the brightness is the proof of its penetration, and if a judgment is suspended on the name of the wicked sign, we have: I became more like this The truth, the prior judgment is the same as the one who is referred to, and the reference is to be attached, and the one who is considered the time of the indication is not the time of the precedent judgment, then if it is true, it is true that it is correct In the same time, in the time of the signal, with the cutting of the previous judgment, it was true, otherwise it is a condemnation, so it is understood and managed.Then he does not praise in his being, this is what is in it in the total and similar, because it is not necessary as his being, this is his guidance, by adopting every part There is what is in it in the way of the people of the doors from the states of what the understandings and the minds do not reach, or because that is not removed from the intention of what is meant by it, as it is the same, as it is the same, as it is the same, as it is the same, as it is the same The clarification is guided, and its guidance stands on anything that does not harm in it, as it is on my opinion, standing on the belief in the faith of the faith of God, the Lord, the Most High And he greeted, the Imam's text was lost.The color of the Qur’an is a pilgrimage to its authenticity, the Qur’an is not guided in it, such as the knowledge of God, and his attributes, and the knowledge of the prophecies, so that there is no reason This is a guidance in the affirmation of what is in the minds, and it is more than it is correct, and it is correct that the Qur’an in itself is guided in everything, until the knowledge of God is the same The mentality, and the arguments of the Levinity, as he feels the appearance of his saying: The month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed to the Qur’an.The righteous here, based on our interpretation (P-110), praises them, to show his grace that they are the ones who were guided, and they used to say that he said: He fears it with the general warning of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The oppressors increase except a loss.I am satisfied with it, this is not hidden in this sentence and verses of harmony, so I did not refer to what it indicated, and that book decided that some of it was not the same as the whole book that is not.It is called a book in its gender, that is, the chapter of the guidance and the guidance, and there is no doubt in it as sure of one of the two knees, and guidance for the righteous, such as the affirmation of the other.And his salvation is the truth that it is limited to the amount of his arrogance in the chapter of rhetoric, and its money in itself, and in which the intended is from it, and it was said: with the sake of the one who is the same Perhaps it became miraculous?He answered that he was complete by reaching the maximum of the fullness and meaning, and it is the meaning of that book, then he was asked about the requirement of the one who is the one who is the whole book, so it is not the best of it Rabi, then when he was talked to the evidence for that, he was a guidance for the righteous to the perseverance of his detection on the religious benefits and the religion of the religion And antagonism, in which he is not denying it except for those who have his soul and his mind stubbornly, and his sense, and it may be said: the miracle is a majestic, the absence of the amount, and the purpose of the words of the words And the likeness of the appearance of its truth, and that is required for its guidance and guidance, for if we look at the union of the suffering according to the hopes, the second is a decision for the first Fellow, even if we look at the fact that the first is required for what is after his obligation after the sincere contemplation, the first is for his commitment to what he follows, and his son is in his strength A house from the house of the insults of what is between them is appropriate and the mandate, so it weighs it and the adultery Because of the intensity of contact between this sentence, and in it also from the terrible joke, and the high advantages that does not hide the majesty of its destiny, on the one who passed what we mentioned.
