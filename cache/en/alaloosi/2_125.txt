The researcher, when we made the house a kindness on and when it was walked and the house is one of the prevailing flags of the cubic, such as the weapon of the wealth, a reward for the people, that is, the whole of them, and it is a whole, And he sought refuge, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, said, or a reference that is repenting to him the elders of the visitors, or their proverbs.To him, some of the investigators said, or the position of reward, who are rewarded with his argument, and his argument, he said by giving and Al -Mawardi narrated it for some of the people of the language, As in a place and a place, and it is for the inheritance of the seat, and it is the saying of the vastness and the gospel, and the fear said: The ritual in it is for the sake of the language as in the propaganda, and the knowledge of it.The adulterers of a metaphor is a meal, or a place, and the blame in the people of the tongue, which is the phenomenon, and the permissibility of its pregnancy on the covenant, or the darkening, And the ritual (deeds) of the group, because it is the reward of every one of the people, no one of them is allocated to it, whether it is in it in it and the bade is, and if it is one of the one who is one of the people Additions, and it was said: The group is by downloading the number of domestication is a home, or by adopting that every part of it is a reward, and the choice of the one who is the one who is the one who is the same That the abbreviation of a group of collections is correct, and it is not known, and in which it is a measure with the difference, as he has the addition of the Mamluk to all of them, not to all of them, not to all of them, not to all of them, not to all of them, not to all of them, not to all of them, not to all of them On a sake and it is a source, and it was described by the lame, and the meant is a place of security, either to his residents from the kidnapp Before him, other than the rights of worshipers, and the financial truths such as disbelief on the correctness, or for the committees who resort to the killing, which is the gold of the imam, Abu Hanif When the soul is not fulfilled in the sanctuary, but it is hung on the side, and it is not spoken, and it is not used, and it is not treated until it comes out and he will be killed, and he will be killed, and he will be killed.He was obliged to seek and seek refuge in him, the imam commands the adaptation to him with what leads to his choice, so if he comes out, he will be established for him in the solution, then he is not.(P-379) And when the Imam Ahmad, may God be pleased with him, is not fulfilled from the resurrection, and if the shame of the parts is not, until he comes out, and from the one who comes out, and from the people of the Secondly, to delete in the sense of the matter, that is, they made it a security, as they made it a reward, and it is far from the appearance of the system, and it was not mentioned to the people as it is as it is as it is.Referring to the general, that is, it is a security for everything that was even the bird and the obscenity except the fifth of the palatable, for it was summarized from that to the tongue of the Messenger of God, In it, the security of the people enter into it first, and take from the place of Ibrahim, the prayer of a compassion for making us or a state of its actor on the will of the saying, that is, and we said, Take, and those who are taught to the people as it is a phenomenon, or the Abraham, peace be upon him, and his children as it was said, or a kindness of the remembrance of the one who worked as a worker, or a worker, or a worker, A guarantee of his estimation: they are a garment to him, and they are taken, and he is supposed to adopt his clothes from that between that between us and our covenant and we did not consider the nurses that are not the same.To him to be the link with the precedent sentence, and the speech is on these two directions for the nation of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace The heads of the addressees, (and from) either to be meticulous, or in the sense (in) or an increase in the fear of the fear, and the first appearance, and the locking said: It is the same as the same God is up to be a good brother, and she entered the bodies of the heavy and its advantage, and the place is an act of resurrection, it is intended by the place, that is, what is the place His Excellency, peace be upon him, upon him, when he was raised from the carpentry, which was his son, whom he would recourse to him in building the house, and in it the effect of his feet, and he said: And others, and Al -Bukhari brought it out, and it is the saying of the vocabulary, and it was narrated from the good that it is the stone that was placed by the wife of the peace of the peace A kneel, so I wash one of his sides, then I raised it from under it, and it was grown up in it and put it in it under his last man, so he was the one who was the last of his man, so he was the one who was the last man His other man is in it too, or the position in which the stone was when he rose up to him, and called on people to the pilgrimage, and raised the building of the house, which is the place The two meanings are a rhetoric, and in the other, it is permissible, and it is permissible to hold the memorizers on each of them, so they said, except that it is a problem with the two things The day, because the barrier of Al -Bari showed that the place was that of the stones from the covenant Abd al -Razzaq with a strong bond, and the son of the son of Merdawi came out with a weak bond from Mujahid that the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, is upon him The two people, whether the transferred, the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, or the age of God, may God bless him He has the case of his place in his position today!It is far from the stones that are in the seven and twelve arm, and the most famous is that the call of people to the pilgrimage was on the authority of Abi Qabis, and it is a pantry.The emptiness of the house of the house, and called: O people, they performed the house of your Lord, for if the stone was not with it, then the saying is that it was the saying of it, and it is for it, On the authority of the mountain, as it indicates to it the words of the rituals of the loved ones, and with it, the collection will be the formation of those who are aware of what is today, and the purpose of the ritual is that it was said: No The stone is converted when the building is transferred from a position to a position, and it is based on it, so he did not have a specific position, and so when the supplication was not, but it was not the same On the authority of Abi Qabis, then their terms must be made from their appearances, that it is said: the place that was the stones at the time of the time of it.Raising the construction, not the state of resurrection on it, and it was signed in some books that this is the place in which the stone is now.To him, and that the stone (P-380) after Ibrahim was a place in the welfare of the kaaba, and perhaps this is the face in the specialization The shrine is from the covenant of Ibrahim, for the rest of the house, after the completion of the architecture.Let them understand, and because of the descent is what the father of Naam has taken out from the hadith of Ibn Omar, “The Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.This is the place of Abraham, and Omar said: Do we not take it as a prayer?For the desirability, as the one who is repeated from the prayer is the place of the prayer, it is divorced, and it was said: What is meant by the matter is with the knees of the Taft, because it was removed from the Muslim from the authority May God bless him and grant him peace, when he emptied his baptism to the place of Ibrahim, and he succeeded his successor.Weakening it, because there is a special prayer in it, and it is a sign of prayer, and his readers are upon him, peace and peace, when he performs the two rak'ahs.Al -Nakha’i and Mujahid that what is meant is from the position of Abraham, all of him, and Ibn Abbas and a giving that he is the positions of the pilgrimage, and the people are that it is a knowledgeable, the diligent, and the diligent The prayer is to be called in it, and it is closer to God Almighty, and the one who has the public, which is what we presented first, is the agreement to the appearance of the word, and the people of the people, He supported him, and he read a sophisticated, and Ibn Amer (and took) by opening the khua on that it is a past action, and it is then it is given to (make us), i.E., and he took from the place of the people.Know it, And his offspring accommodated him, and it is the kaaba before they prayed to it, so the place is metaphor for that place, and also the worshiper in the sense of the kiss from the one who is a metaphor from the one who is a metaphor from the one who is a metaphor from the one Prayer is due to the relationship of near and al -Muhajara, and our covenant to Abraham and the hearing of any of our guardians, or our command, or our insistence, or our sayings, and those who have to be fulfilled, if the one who is the one In the sense of expulsion, and it is permissible for it from the matter, and the listening of a knowledgeable knowledge that was said: it is with it in the Arabian, the obedience May God bless him with a son and say: I hear Il, meaning that my prayers are answered, O God The two languages ​​of the mother and the noun, that the purification of my house, that is, by purifying that () is a source, and it was established with the verb of the matter as a man of the commander, and the one who is the one, The fact that the source of the forefathers are an order or an end, and the gathering prevented that, inferring that if a source is caught by it, then the meaning of the matter, and that it is the meaning of the matter, and that it is the meaning of the matter As his prayer is a experience, and the person is the same as the same, and they are appreciated here.With the verb with the interpretation of the source, the union of its meaning is not called the harm of the sign of the source of the time with the connotation of the verb on it, and the second is that it is the same A experienced in the thick communication, but it is for the connection to the description of the acquaintance with the phrase, and it is not described in it, unless it is an expert, and the connection is not like that The estimation of our saying is that it is the one who is commanded by the saying, and it is not like that, and it is permissible to be that (that) this is an innocent, so that it can be presented to the authority His forests, which are the covenant, and then need to appreciate the effective, as it is involved with the progress of what is mentioned as the entry of its income, an infidel of the one.It is an empty, that is, we said something to them is to purify, and what is meant by purification is the cleansing of everything that is not incurred, so he enters into it the two and the spoils, and all of the hidden ones, and what is forbidden, Like the opponent, Mujahid and Ibn Akaya and Muqtaf, and Ibn Jubayr al -Tathair by removing the second, were reminded, and they reminded that the house was overwhelmed by the covenant of Noah, and it was upon him.The most righteous, and that the covenant was prolonged (P-381), the covenant, and it worshiped without God Almighty, so God commanded the Almighty to purify him from it, and it was said: The intention is that he is good On the authority of Al -Fareth and the blood he was laid in, and it was said: He made it a sauce for those who were mentioned in where he does not cheat it, so the purification is a burden on the authority of the one who is from it Building and founding on purity, And Al -Tawahid, which is far, and the matter is here to Abraham, and to be heard.Its words are correct about him: And when we have been brought to the place of the place of the house, and the hearing was then with the isolation of the rhetoric, and the appearance of this is the same.And the end, and the completion of the construction with its proximity, as it is reported from it.Exalted from that great high, for those who are for them, for their sake.With him, if he turns around him, and he appears that what is meant is that everyone who is wrapped from a present or a core, and a giving and others went to him, and Ibn Jabir said: And visitors, and the people who are the people of the country residing in the son of Jabir, and Ata said: They are the ones who are sitting without a mud from my country, and a deceased, and he said: The strangeness, and it was said: They are the ones who are shrouded in, and the prostration is the prostration, and they are the ones who are gathered and prostrated.His refuge in Him is the Almighty, and they are the great knee A prayer with bowing and prostrating, not the prayer of Jews, and the kneeling came to present it in time, and collect a broken collection to change the paradise of the unique جَمْعَيِ السَّلامَةِ, وفي ذَلِكَ تَنْوِيعٌ في الفَصاحَةِ, وخالَفَ بَيْنَ وزْنَيْ تَكْسِيرِهِما لِلتَّنْوِيعِ مَعَ المُخالَفَةِ في الهَيْآتِ, وكانَ آخِرُهُما عَلى فُعُولٍ, لِأجْلِ كَوْنِهِ A separator, and the connections before and after the last of it a letter before it is a tidal, and softness.
