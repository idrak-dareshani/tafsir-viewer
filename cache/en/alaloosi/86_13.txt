The Quranic researcher is that of the Qur’an, which is from the sentence of these sophisticated verses with the beginning of the state of man and its return, and it is the first to make the guerrilla return to what is presented; That is, what I have told you about my ability to live, because the Qur’an will be informed of that first.And the words of the Almighty: A saying is a chapter that is attributed to it and the meantic: a word separated between the truth and the falsehood that has reached the end in that, as if it is the same The chapter on slippery after it is called for a break.That is, a saying that is cut off with it and the first is better.And what is slippery, that is: there is nothing in it, a slight, but all of it is pure, so it is his right to be guided by the temptations and subjected to it.In a hadith that Al -Tirmidhi and Al -Darmami and Ibn Al -Anbari narrated from Al -Harith Al -Awar, “On the authority of Ali, the Exalted of God Almighty said:“ I heard the Messenger of God, the Messenger of God.It will be a temptation." By slipping, whoever left it from the mighty of God, and whoever is the guidance of the guidance, otherwise, God is lost, and he is the dome of God who is dead, and he is the wise masculinity, and it is the path of the one who is the one who does not The passions, and the scholars do not follow from it, and the people are not confused with it, and it is not created from the response, and its wonders do not spend, it is the one who did not give it to the hearing of the time.A wonder Qur’an guides to the guidance of those who said it is true, and whoever judged him is just, and whoever does it is rewarded and who guided him guided to a straight path.In this response to those who rejected them behind their appearance.
