The researcher Al -Qarqimin, where you came out, and your face, the waters of the mosque, the forbidden, and where you were not.On his words, the Almighty: We have seen your face, etc.The compassion of the story is on the story, and it is not given to the words The indication of his arrangement on his words is up to the Almighty: and for each face; Because he is stolen by the Almighty saying: So that people should not have an argument, and if it is a reason for (and those who), not for a deleted; That is, we recognized you the face of the righteousness in your kiss, and the argument is in that as it was said: except that it is understood from it as a cause for it (for) because it is the same For the nation, his obtaining it for the Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - with the first part of the first way, and if he made the speech in general to the Messenger - may God bless him and grant him peace It is obligatory to be specialized in the nation at the end of the speeches of the verse, it was a cause for them, but it was repeated this judgment for the multiplicity of his glory, and the one who is the one who is more than that (P -17) or a claim, so it is - the exalted - mentioned to the conversion of three urine, the greatness of the Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - by abusing the path On all the people of the mortar (second) and pay the pilgrims, (third), then the recitation of the Kaaba is pushed by the rituals of the murdered The kaaba kissed, not the rock, and this Prophet prayed to the rock, so the Prophet will not be the barrier, and that he - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - may God bless him - It follows our kisses and among them is a fire; Because his habit - his pneumatism and an adequate - is a neighbor who specializes in every project owner with a kiss, and the involvement of the partners is pushed His kisses and left - their grace - the perpetrator after the specialization in the rank, the third: it is satisfied with the acts that are beneficial from the cause, and it increased (from the time In violation of the state of travel for the state of attendance, that the state of travel will be the rest of what was as in the prayer; Where it increases in the presence two rak'ahs, or it is a choice between the two sides as in fasting.It may be said: This is a good idea.Because it is one of the perseverance of the stabbing, and the many who are disagreed in it because of the difference between the separation between the copying and the breasts, and it was said: Do not be a crime, then the circumstances are three; It is in the mosque.And it is in the country outside the mosque.And his being is out of the country, for the first is the first on the first, the second on the second, and the third is on the third, and it is not hidden that it is a trick that does not do it.Except those who have been wronged from them, and it is a substitute for The deceased, and the meaning of the two sayings: that the discretion is from the negation; Like one of the people, there is no pilgrimage to you except those who have been wronged by the stubbornness, for you have an argument for you, for the Juda of them says what you do not say to you His people and love for his country, and those who are involved from them say that he will return to him before his fathers, and he is about to return to their religion, and the name of this A pilgrimage with the fact that it is a burden on the proof of the seedlings of the one who is intended to be young, with it by adopting that they are in its arms, and it is supposed to be bound by the words of the words The collection is necessary between the truth and the metaphor, otherwise the discretion is not valid; Because the argument is specialized in the truth, and there is no stance except that it is intended to be the one who is truly or -called, and it is answered, and it is answered that he did not exceed the same.They are about the people, except that the name of their likeness is obligatory, with an argument of the concept of the violator, so there is no need for the enemy of the chest, The discretion, even if it is one of the people, is that it is proven by what was exiled from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is exiled from it, based on the fact that the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is a sin, What was proven to me, the gathering is necessary, otherwise the discretion was fulfilled by its requirements; As I fixed for the one who is excluded from him, and the exalted thing is something else, and there is no discord to disclose from that, except that it is intended with the argument that is not the one who is absolute The sentence, then it will be achieved at that time.Because the suspicion is a pilgrimage in this sense, such as the proof, and the collection is not necessary between the truth and the metaphor, and you are to carry the pilgrimage to the righteousness and the rituals in the same way A pilgrimage between us and between you, the matter of the discretion is then clear, except that the wording of the words is far from the recovery at the will of this meaning, and it is the meaning of this meaning, and it is said: From the affirmation of the thing against it and its evidence with its exile, and the meaning is that they have an argument, then it is darkness, and the shadow cannot be, and it is an argument.It is a proof of the way of the betting at the limit of its saying: there is no defect in them, as it is not that their removing them is the blame of the people of love and the cet and the reader of the son of the son of God.With openness and lightness, and it is a letter that the words open to the righteousness of the righteousness, and those who begin to tell it, the words of it are not, so that it is not the same: To confirm, and it was said: to include the beginner (P-18) the meaning of the condition, and it is permissible for the connector to be a stake on the purpose of interpretation, and the man Excellent for fear; That is: Do not be afraid of the unjust; Because they do not appreciate the benefit or harm, and it is permissible to return the destiny to the people and in it a distance.And I fear me, that is, and they are afraid of me, so do not fear my matter, for I am the one who is able to do everything, and some people of the Sunnah have inferred with the verse of the verse of the veneration of the verse, - If God wills exalted - you will achieve that in his place.And to fulfill my blessings on you, and perhaps you will be guided 150 People will have an argument, and to complete, etc., it is a cause for male; That is, I commanded you to do so to you the best of the two house With the discretion and after it; Because - no one who separated - as he is a comment of the first cause, we are subjected to the aftermath of the suitability, and that the will of the man who feels the ritual of the rituals is for the sake of the ritual With the inclination, not to do the one who is commanded by it as it is the appearance in the kind of it, so the manifestation is the meaning of making it a reason for the deletion; That is: I commanded you to take advantage and fear to complete my blessing to you and my will to give you, and the premium sentence is given to the pre -emption sentence An likely appreciation and fear for you to keep you, and to complete, etc.And some of them suggested this direction as the Bukhari brought him out in the unique literature, and the symbolism of the hadith of Muhah ibn Jabl: The first may be interpreted to the meaning of (worship) and prayed, heading, the dominance of the mosque is the forbidden to bring you paradise.And the hadith does not refuse this, but it is prescribed by the example of the chaatance by the slander.He died - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - the day I have completed your religion and I have fulfilled my blessing to you, so he showed that the blessing of the blessing, but it is the same In the years in this verse: and for my grace to you, I will answer that the grace of the blessing is at all times with what is worthy of it, so it is managed.
