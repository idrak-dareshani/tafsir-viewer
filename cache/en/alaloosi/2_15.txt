The Quranic researcher, who is mocking the people of the hadith and the people of the people of the trial of the mockery of it, is up to his right, and if he is not the one who is the one Glory be to him, and they said: It is the right to the face of it, that those who looked at him will be surprised by him, and he laughed, and he does not seek it from it.The measuring of the absent on the witness, and the most people went to that it is not described as a majesty and a right, because it is in it from the report of the one who is overwhelmed with it, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is in the face of the one who is in the face of the sake of the one who is in the face of the sake And the mercy is that the right thing is to be seen, and if it has it, it is not described by the mockery of it, then it is a play that does not fit its arrogance, so the exalted is the one who is a good thing With the mockery of its reward for what is between the verb and its parts of the similarity in the destiny, and a strong dress, and the types of Sabbiyah with the existence of the problems of the good A liking is a metaphor or a metaphor, or that it is intended to remove the contempt and the colonial, so it is a metaphor for what is in the house Imagination, and in contrast, in view of the existence, or that God makes the Almighty and sanctifies like the one who is mocking them on the way of the mandate, and the place of the place, Sitting, and the Lord of something is correct, and he does not correct a intention, and he has a groan to call the sacred himself what he does not understand the servants of the servants, and he said: The way of the representative, and the meant is that they are treated by the mockery of the mockery.One of them is a door to paradise, and it is said: He gone, so he will come with his passion and his clouds.With his anguish and his clouds, then if he comes to him, he will be closed without him, so what is also so is that the man will open a door for him and he said: He is not, so what comes to him, and he came to him, and he came to him Good chain of transmission in (P-159), who are mocked by people, and supported by the mockery of him, the top of the sentence with his remembrance of the alerts, to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same It is the dixum that is not more than it is more than their mockery of their chests, who is inserting their knowledge and their ability in the side of his knowledge, and his knowledge of his knowledge, and his destiny, The believers, and took revenge for them, and what I needed to the opposition of the hypocrites is great for their affairs, because they are not mocked by them except for it, and there is no one in it, and there is no one in it, and there is no one in it, and there is no one who is more The compassion is because it is the original, and there is no one in the precedent sentence that is correct for this saying to him, except with a cost and a distance, and it was said: to be the reference The question about the treatment of God is with them in the interview of their treatment of this With the believers, and their saying, but we are mocked by a notice that what was told of the sheet is where it requires the appearance of others, and he asks for all of God.From them, and the words of some of those who are achieved feel that this is the saying of this words of kindness, and if there is a good deleted for the place - as a matter That in the interview of their mockery, it is not beneficial that God is the most richest of the believers from their opponents, and that he has given their rewards, but the delusion of release, but he is a delusion, but it is a matter With this metaphor, and also to be the mockery of God, the exalted beyond, far from their mockery, to where there is no occasion between them, the kindness is like Two women, and some of them arranged the two who were mentioned in the chain of transmission to the exaltation of the rented, claiming that he was a kind of people, and he is a kind of people.That it is said: The believers are mocked by them, and God is mocking them with the dead and the two fools, and this is what we have mentioned, and the one who said, So he managed, and his grace was adjusted from: God is mocked by them, the meals for their saying: to his saying: God will mocked them, for the sake It is the most informed of the confidentiality that the name is beneficial to the name, because the calamity, if it is dominated, may be tired, and the soul is destroyed as it was said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ I left Shaibi, the heart of the heart, crying, and the majesties of God were exalted in them, and the verses of the verses in their affairs were a matter Once, or two times, the farmer warn that a wall will be revealed to them, and they will tell them about their hearts.The lowest, and the torment of the hereafter is more severe, even if they knew and stated the mockery of it here so that the mockery of them will be a text, but it is left with it, but it is left to the one who has left it.Fear of his prayer for the believers, so they kept the memorial, and it is a place to be a field in the melting, if they are stuck, then make God Almighty the words of the word And his word is the high and extends them in their tyrants, they are kind to his saying, and they are exalted: he is mocking them as a man, and he is the one who has the same In this regard, that is, he has the right to strengthen and multiply it, and it was said: raised more than the gender, and he has increased more than the gender, and it was said: ranked in evil, and he is in the good, He was extended in evil, so perhaps from a door, and preached them with a painful torment, and he returned the use of this material with two meanings, one of which is what we mentioned, and the second of them is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who mentioned us, and the second of them is Without the second, for two, the first is that it was narrated from a son Many of the seven (extending them) by the increase from the increase, and it was not heard in the second, and the second is that it is prepared with itself, and the other is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one, and the other So it is not committed without a reason, so it is meaning that they extend them in their tyrants, and they will increase them, and to strengthen them in it, and to that, the good and other things go, and the truth is that Al -Zajaj, Ibn Kaysan, and Al -Wajhan Mukhdoushan.Both of them are one of the original origin, and with whom it is returned to the increase, as a quantum or how, and in the chapter, God extends its age and extends it in the absence of his lust, and he took from him (p-16) Masoud, may God be pleased with him, that the extension of God is exalted in their tyrants, who are living from the disobedience The truth is a truth, as it is its grace and the glorified of the created for the things, the one who is alienated by breaking it on the basis of what the wisdom required, and it was raised for it, Throughout him, his praise and exalted in his saying, the glory of his affairs: and their brothers extend their absence in the absence of the proportions of the death to the king in his saying, the Almighty: Glory be to God: God dies and goes to the disgrace that the leadership is in the tyrant and the piety in it, which is what the attribution of it is true, Obtaining the last, and we have provided what they are of their gaming, so let us be here on what is in it, and the overwhelming people are to add the lean on the famous, and he read Zayd al -Zayd, With her breaking, and they are two languages ​​in it, and she has been heard in the source of the meeting, and his hopes have been made, and the origin of it is the perpetrator of the place in which you have stand And the mental knowledge of it, so it was not overwhelmed, and it was overwhelmed by the water, that is, it will pass the known limit in it, and added it to them, because it is the one of them.The influenced by the permission of God is the Almighty, for the one who feels the addition of the addition is in this man The creation is excluded from otherwise standing on the act of what he wants, for it is a dust on it, but there is no dust that does not have a dust, so there is no adultery He was subjected to him, and it is necessary for the sake to be the reference to the indication that the tyrants are others on their side, as well The rhetoric, (and the uncle) is frequency and confusion, and it is used in the opinion in particular, and the uncle is in it and in the eyesight, so between them is general and specially divorced in the recovery And the uncle of the eyes was concluded with the eyesight On what was said, and its original origin is the nodd of the Emirates on the way that is erected to be condemned from a carpentry, dust, and their parts, which is the light, and it is said: his uncle, he will do it.His uncle, his year, and his cousins, so they mean that they are heard and confused, and to that a group of immoral people went Qatibah: It is that his head will be paid, so he does not see what comes to, for the meaning is blind to their rationality or they will be cared for, so they do not see, as if this is the right, and if this is the right The hypocrites were not the frequency of the disbelievers, but they were Egypt, who are in accordance with the right, and what it has is invalid, except that it is said: the hesitation is not in the matter of the one, in the heart of the one, in the matter of the hesitation, there is no one in the matter, And a sentence that they are in the position of a position in the case, either from the guerrillas in their exaltation, or from the guilt in their tyrants, because it is a source added to the verb, It is attached to them, and that they are attached to their blindness, and it is permissible to disagree with their tyrants and they are in their hands,
