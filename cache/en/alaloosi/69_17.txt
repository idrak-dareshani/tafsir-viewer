The Quranic researcher, the king, that is, the jungle of the king, is the best of the angels with the Zamakhir The angels and do not appear that it is better than the angels and the achievement of this place with no more than it is more than the explanation That is, its sides, the collection of the inclusive of the palace, and it is one of the wow, and therefore it was highlighted in the trinity.For the sky and what is meant by its sides, its frames that were not inhaled the delay of the son of the alert from Ibn Jabir and the laughter, he said that they said and the king is on the authority of what he did, Perhaps this is the way of them to the part of what was inside the notice of the greatness of God, glory and glory, or meeting there for you to go down..Ibn al -Mundhir and Abd al -Hamid narrated from Al -Rabi` ibn Anas who said and the king on its part It appears, and perhaps this is the distress after the death of the angels with the first blow and their lives while they live before the people, as it is required of the people.After the second blow and the people in the mud, in some antiquities, what feels the inhalation of every heaven on the day, and the descent of its angels, and the day, as well as the day.The Imam said that they are standing on the way to a moment and then they die.It is possible that what is meant by those who have been exempt from God be exalted in his saying, Glory be to Him (except for those who will God) [Al -Nimal: 87, Al -Zamer: 68].And on the two prestiges, what is said is said to die in the first shock to the saying of the Almighty, and he was subjected to those in the heavens and from the earth [Al -Zamar: 68] Heaven and in the lights of download, perhaps his saying, and the sky was created, etc., analogy of the wing of the world with the oath of the buildings, and the light of its people, if it is the same.The death of the angels, the effect of that is the end, and I do not say that the representatives of the representatives and the sea on the authority of Ibn Jabir and the laughter are that the guarantee of its shadow is for the land, and if it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same.They memorize its parts, as it was narrated that God Almighty commands the heavens of the worldly sky, and they will stand in a row on the edges of the earth, then the angels of the second, then the second of them.The angels of every sky, so the word is one of the elders and the people, and the earth is surrounded by it, and perhaps what we said about them, and it was taken care of.And the throne of your Lord is borne above them, that is, on the authority of the angels who are on the one who is on them with the king and it was said on the authority of the whole world and the one who said: The bearers, that is, carry the throne of your Lord above Their appearances or their heads are eighty and the reference, and if it is delayed, it is ahead, but it is ahead of the arrangement, and it is ahead of them.With their hands, like the comment, the example, and the support of this, and the adoption of the appearance in the way that was brought out by the symbols, and Abu Dawid, and the day Hadith and above that is eighty or loudly among their opponents and their blessing between a sky to a sky and then above their appearance between the throne between the lower and the most like it the sky".What is meant by the most important in which there is angels on the image of the caliphs, as Ibn al -Athir said and others, and it is a collection and the case with the breaking of the eye that is the mountain, and the one who is broken by it is the one who is the one who is the same The indication of this is a lot, except that it has a drain from the significance of each other that some of them are on the image The image of the eclipse and the significance of another that each one of them is four or the face of the face and the face of a bronch As for two wings, it is on the authority of his face, fearing that he looks at the throne, and it is stunned, and two wings will fly with them and Abu Hayyan, he did not say that he said, These eighties are a liabless, and we were beaten by its remembrance and the delay of Abd Bin Hamid (P-46) from Ibn Zaid from the Prophet ï·º that he said: The day of the resurrection is eighty.And the son of Abi Hatim was removed from him that he was not named from the lamb And peace be upon him, from the sentence of his pregnancy, is obligated to prove this with a news that is dependent on it.On the authority of Shahr ibn Hawshab, four of them say: Glory be to God, and praise you for you, praise for you, after your ability, and four people say: You are praise for your dream after your knowledge.And in the news of Wahb ibn Mnabar, they have no words, except for their saying.Abd al -Hamid on the authority of al -Dahhak that he said that the eighties of Safouf are said that only God knows best, but God is glorified and exalted, and he was brought out by this saying, Ibn Jarir and Ibn al -Murhar and the son of the son of the son of the son of the son It was narrated from Ibn Abbas, and Al -Hassan said: God is the Almighty, how are they the ethnicity of the eighty or eighty types of people, and you know that the supporter is the one who is the one who is good.Persons, and whatever it is, it is clear that there is a pregnancy on the truth, and it is the gossip of the debt of religion, and his secret is sanctified.On the authority of them, they are four and tomorrow they will be eighty for the sake of the bearing to the land of the mud.He has the sanctity of his secret in the third section of his conquests as wide words in the burden of the throne, but it is only on his interpretation of the king, so let him return to him.For the understanding of his words and the permissibility that it is a representative of his greatness, glory and exalted with what is witnessed by the conditions Glory be to the bone attribute, and made the presentation in its words.
