The Quranic researcher writes to you if one of you attends the death of another ruling from the rulings removed, and its separation is what preceded it to the significance of it, as well The right to this, and he did not tell him to those who believe in the approach of the covenant by the alert with his clothes with the precedents in the cousin of each of them, Because when he was not difficult, he did not export him as the hardship was ran out of his act, and what is meant by (the presence of death) is the presence of his causes, and the appearance of his princesses The fear, or its presence itself and its deficiency, and the presentation of the verb to benefit as the option of the active at the same soul.If you leave better, that is, money, as Ibn Abbas said - may God be pleased with him - and a jurist, and restricted him to make him many; As it is not said in the knowledge of the mortality: (good) unless it is a lot, as it is not said: so that it is money, unless he has many money, and he will support him of what he has brought out, and the one who has been brought up, - God honored the Almighty - He entered a money for him in the death and has the seventh of their dirham or the fulfillment of a dirham, so he said: Is I not recommended?He said: No, but God Almighty said: If you leave good and have a lot of money, then let your money to your inheritance.And what Ibn Abi Shaiba brought out about Aisha - may God be pleased with her - that a man said to her: I want to recommend, she said: How much is your money?He said: Three thousand, she said: How much do you have?He said: Four, she said: God Almighty said: If you leave good and this is something that is easy to leave for your life, then it is better, and the most promising is that this is a lot, and there is a lot.It is different from the disagreement of the man of the man, as it is with a category of money describing a man as a rich person and does not describe him other than the many children.And on the authority of Ibn Abbas - may God be pleased with them - his estimation, and Abd Bin Hamid was broken from him: Al -Zuhri is that (the commandment) is a holy, which has said or many, for the good has money, and it is one of its breaks, and perhaps his choice is to be a matter of what he is not.Good, not bound; Because the height is obligatory to return it to his heads and sin (the commandment) in it.The commandment for the two parents and the closest: it is broken by the books and in the satisfaction if the apparent is not the right to be separated, then it is left (P-53) Al -Haqiqi, otherwise, and this is the choice of here, reminding the verb, and the commandment is a name from the recommendation that is recommended, and in the commands or its commandments, it is a thief, and it is a covenant to it, It is also recommended by it, and the neighbor is attached to it, so it is necessary to be interpreted by that with the verb with the gathering, or by the source, based on the realization of the one who does not He stops his interpretation The most correct, and that is the most correct in his country, and it is permissible for the deputy to be on you and the commandment is a beginner news, as if it was said: What is the bound?It was said: It is the commandment, and the condition of the condition is deleted, indicated by it (he was written on you) and it was said: the beginning of his news for the religion and the sentence is the answer to the condition of the condition; Because if it is a penalty, it is necessary for it, and the conditional sentence is permitted by the books or you have to be alone, and the sentence is not the same, and the ritual is not.He only seduces him in the harm of the poetry, as the Khalil said, and the work in (if) the meaning of (books) and the custody is the restriction of the positive from the place where the sins and the rituals are Excellency - upon you and his writers if he is prepared and changed to what you see to organize this meaning that it is written in the eternal, and it is permissible to be the commanding worker, and if it is, if it is, and it is the name of it Followed by the source or by the verb, and the difference is sufficient for the act of the verb; Because he has an affair that is not for others to download it from the thing, its soul is his soul in it, and it is a dismantling of it from it, and it is not for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for it, and for this, and for this, and for it, It is expanded in the other hand, and not every interpreter of the ruling of the ruling of what he is pronounced, and there may be a lot It is mentioned on the two estimates that the commandment is obligatory (whoever the death attended) is not on all of the believers when one of them is dead; Because one of you benefits the general on the path of al -Badal, then it is meaning (if one of you is attended) if one is one after one, but it is more than one of the sake of the sequel on the authority of it.A sufficiency, as he wrote to you in the killing and saying that the commandment was not imposed on (whoever attended the death), so he only said that he is not.He replaces, and this is what he said: to you and said: One of you; Because the death is attending one of those who address the symptoms of them is nothing; Because the preservation of the commandment is imposed on some after the commandment, not the time of the dying, so how is it correct to say: He will be imposed on you, if the commandment is preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if the will will be preserved, if you are the guardian of the commandment, Because the will to be up and preserve it from the will is not hidden, and the choice of some investigators is that (if) is a condition and the answer of each of the conditioners, then the one who is the one, then One of you is the death), so let him leave it for good, then the answer to the first condition of the way of the context is deleted, and the answer to the second condition was deleted for the first condition of the condition of the first condition The second condition for him, when the owner of Al -Tasheel is tied to the first, as if it was said: If one of you attends the death of the good for the good, then the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is good Between the books and its acts of the way of the Keva of the Excellency before, and it is not hidden that this face is with his singing from the cost of correction Al -Khurafiya and the increase in the memorization of one of the Quranic rhetoric; Where the judgment was first repaired, then detailed and the symptoms occurred between the verb and its actor for the fulfillment of the way to the way of the duty of the duty, and it is the duty of the duty, The many delicious deletions of what was presented, then this judgment was at the beginning of Islam, then we are copied with the verse of the inheritances as the son of Abbas and Ibn Umar and the son of the And others, and Ahmad and Abd al -Hamid and al -Tirmidhi were removed and corrected and the women and the son of Majah on the authority of Amr ibn Kharja - may God be pleased with them - And he greeted - his speech on his path, and he said: “God has divided every person who has a heir, so do not allow the heir of a trustee.” The Imam of Al -Bahli, “I heard the Messenger of God - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - in the Hajj of the Hemorrhoids in his speech.For a heir, “and Abd Bin Hamid broke out about Al-Hasan, we are the same, and this hadith is to receive the nation for it with the acceptance of the acceptance in the validity of the The copying of it is when our imams - may God sanctify their secrets - but some said: It is one of the frequent, and that the frequency may be by the transfer of those who are not the one who does not see it.It will be with their act that they would work with it from other than them, on the fact that the copying in the truth is with the verse of inheritances and the hadiths is clear, and it is clear.That is in two John; The first: that it came down after the verse of the commandment with the agreement, and the Almighty said: After a guardian, it is recommended or a debt, so the inheritance arranged on (a guardian) (a guardian) With a testimony, and if it was that (the commandment), it would have been necessary for it to be paid on the prestige, so when it was not arranged on it and arranged on the one The restriction; Because launching after the pursuit is copying, as the piety after the release, as well as the two meanings.The second: that the copy is a variety; One of them is a shift after a curtain, and the second: with a way of transformation from one place to another as in the copying of the kiss, and this is from the second one; Because God - the Exalted - was imposed in the closest to the worshipers, on the condition that they take into account the limits, and show the right of every relative according to his closeness, and the sign of it.With the well -being, that is, by justice, then when the recommended may not improve the mobilization in the amount of what is recommended for each one of them, and perhaps he was intended to be the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The right to the face that it is certain that it is the right thing, and that it is in it.[Translation failed: Request exception can happen due to an api connection error.Please check your connection and try again]
