The researcher, the Qur’an, has created you, that is, and the situation is that you are in a state of contradiction, because you are in the college, which is that you know that he is glorified and created your creation, and you are in the way of you in the cases Presse, then soften, then get stuck, then chew, then bones and worries, and then create another, so the shortening in the enemy of this one is in the capacity of the murder This is what is hardly released from the sane, as the sentence is a state of an actor that does not hope for a decision of the disagreement and the different conditions.And they sought his saying: ؎ If he woke up, then his mother has flew and the woman creates a bird after the phases (P-74) and carried it on what you heard from the one who gave it to the one Ibn Abbas and Mujahid requires it, even if it is limited to the remembrance of the sperm, the relationship, and the chew The shame, power, weakening, and it is said from the colors, the bodies, the ethics, and the different boredom.It was said of health, fertilization, and the fullness of the members, its exclusion, richness, and poverty, and the like this, and it was said: The hope in the sense of hope is as it is the known origin in it, and the veil is the meaning Smitation and I want the glorification of God, and God has a man for the great component, so it is a beginner, deleted, i.E.My will to God, or stuck to God.The masculine, that is, is a dignity for God, and it is not commented on the masculine, based on what was correct on what is in it that the reaction of the source is a divorce, and it is not for him, and it is not possible for him to be.What is in the scouts.And in it that the meaning is what you do not be in the case of the hope in which God glorifies the Almighty in the house As if it was said to the enemy, that is, whoever glorifies us and his greatness is allocated to us, so he said to God and interpreted him with his saying to him, to the state The assassination of them, as if it was said that you are deceived.He made urbanization on the authority of the urbanization of faith and good deeds for the necessity of the reasons for the reasons for the disagreement of the vanity, which is a generous, generous, and not, and it is not.To hide the difference between hope and vanity over the most, it was a face that he said in the revelation.And that of the romantic domain is followed by the mercy that the noise of the disbelief is for the greatness of God, the Almighty, in the house of the reward, not in the place The continent in the sense of enemy from arbitrariness and in making God a place for the righteousness and the pretext that if it was delayed, it would be a prayer for the cow from the ritual of what is not.For a barrier, it is necessary that the enemy be the same A link to the cows, as it is necessary for the vengeance of them, and the continent, and a description of it, is glorified, and endowed.And I will answer the matter of contradiction that if you say a beyond, it is permissible for it to be an effective increase and that it will be an active and suffice a witness to the validity of the two additions, and the one who is the same The continent in the sense of the enemy is an exalted, so the continent will be a description of the addressees, and it is required that it be attached to it, so it will be the one who will be the one who will be Come here.The absence of what is in the door is that when he came to God and prevented his attachment to the late source, he became a biar and appointed the two villages the will of the breasts of the enemy from this, and this is the one who is from it.The contradiction is yes, the words remain in the Qur’an, and perhaps the righteousness is based on the fact that the people follow up to accept and give God to them, if they are left, then they are left.The suspicion is removed, as you heard from their saying, how to accept us and be kind to us, etc.It is known from this answer to his saying that the numbers of the disbelief are for the greatness of God, the Almighty is not in the matter He created you to his saying of his grace- as a result of the significance that he has gone through his affairs, and he is still blessed with you with your disbelief, so how do you not be blessed with you..The phases are interpreted by what the human being in his teeth is of different matters such as boyhood, youth, and the elders, and others, which is what is in the case of disbelief, and the right And the time of the return in the land is committed to them, with them, based on the fact that there is a rush of the forefront of the forefront on the easiest of the face after the solutions After this, it was not done, or it was not fulfilled that the remote face is a cost that is far from the phenomenon of the stages, and it was said: The meaning is what you do not fear, and you will be afraid So believe in the meaning of the fear and the continent in the sense of the dream, as it is as it appears to be the words of the desire or the notice of it for their partnership in the second, or not in the second, or not in the second, or not.Al -Wakqar is usual and in a narration from Ibn Abbas, his interpretation of the punishment, where he said, "Whatever you do not fear for God, he is a punishment, and he is from the kinetah, then a good one is from And the sacrifice is that the meaning is what you do not have a great prayer.Qatarb said: (P-75) This is a language of the people of Hijaz, this, and the Khazua, and a harmful, they say, I did not hope that I did not see it, and the suffering of what we mentioned first.
