And the prophet, upon whom the prayer and peace, and the Lord and the Lord, have sealed it with this greatness of his Prophet ﷺ and his followers, and affirmation and the frustration of this He witnessed his grace and exalted here for those who were presented in the chest of the surah with the glory of faith and the good of obedience and their equity with that of the verb, and his

the words He wounds a scratch, that is, every one (P-68) of them is safe.In God, that is, he believed in him and his descriptions, and he denied the suspicion of him and his eagerness of what he does not fulfill his arrogance from the part of the partnership of the partners in Al -Awli, and the Lord of God They are informed, purified, and they do not disobey God, what they commanded and do what they command, from their struggle between them They mentioned in the system before his saying: His books and his messengers, that is, from where their coming from him is up to him on the face that is

the (safe) or a light -up on that it is another news of (all), meaning they say, or say: We do not separate from the one who is separated from With some and disbelieved with one, as the people of the
