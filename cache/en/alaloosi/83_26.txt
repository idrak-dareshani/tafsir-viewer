The Quranic researcher is from Rahiq.The Khalil said: He is the wine, and the lighter and the dagger said: The drink in which there is no cheating, Hasan said: They are watered by the one who is the one It is accompanied by the sake of the weapon, and it is interpreted here with the pure drink, which is stressed until the seal is the conclusion of it, that is: the seal of its sake The clay is as it was narrated from Mujahid, and it was mentioned that the mud of paradise is a dumping musk, and the purpose is that the closing is what is sealed with it, and that the seal is on its truth.And our saying: The seal of its utensils, etc., is not because the chain of transmission is a metaphor, but because the seal is for something, I mean the charitable from it with the time of it, and it is the way of it, To honor his mustache, and that was what is on this clay in order to be on the doves.It is permissible for that to be a representative of his breaths, otherwise there is no dust, flies, or betrayal to be preserved on that with seduction.Ibn Abbas and Ibn Jubayr and Al -Hassan said: The meaning is his conclusion and its end is the smell of Musk if it is drinking; That is, his mustache finds that when his drink is ended, and that was because the delegation of the condolences is with the money of his pleasure, it is forbidden to perceive the shame, then the shame is the one who is the one who has the shame, then it is the one who has the shame, then it is the one who has the shame, then it is the one who has the shame, then the Otherwise, the charts are not specialized in the end.It was said: The meaning has an end to its end, and what remains after its drink and drink in its utensils as a musk, and it is not the drink of the world.And what is established in its vessel is a clay or its part, and it is as it is seen.It was said: The merciful is mixed with infidels and seals his mood with the musk, so the meaning: it is a fiction of the conclusion of its mood, and it is with the costume of the one who is in the face In the sentence, he needs a transmission that is dependent on him, and he read to me, the generosity of God Almighty, his face, Al -Nakhdi, Al -Dahlak, Zayd ibn Ali, Abu Hayyah In a thousand after the khu, and the conquest of the Tax, and what is meant by what is sealed by it also; It is an act of conquest, as well as the name of a family, such as the dome and the nicknames, but it is hearing.And on the authority of Al -Dahhak, Issa and Ahmad ibn Jabir al -Anati on the authority of Al -Kisaâ€™i, the break of the Tax; That is, the last is a soup of musk, and the precedent camel means: on your opinions, they look and know their faces, etc., and they will be given, etc.Women like a sentence (the righteous), etc.And in that is a sign of the merciful, which is the most insignificant, after or to what has been mentioned in their conditions and what it contains in the sense of the distance of the sense of the fact that it is his arrangement, and the distance of it.To be in paradise, and the neighbor and the boring are attached to his words, the Almighty: let him compete and be presented to the imitator or to the confinement; That is, let him compete (P-76) and to desire in it, not in the denominations of the world or not, other than it is from its sanctuary and its opponents, which is any Those who are in the beginning of the obedience to God Almighty, and it was said: That is: let him work for the sake of it; That is, for the sake of its acquisition in particular and the width of it, the workers, as the Almighty saying: for the same as this, let the workers work, that is: let him be in the way of the time And the origin of competition in the negative thing, and its origin from the soul to its pride.Al -Kaddi said: I breathed himself as a breath, and competition is a reaction from him as if one of the two people wants to be affected by it.Al -Baghwi said: The origin of the precious thing that is keen on the souls of the people and wants it every one to itself, and it is said: I have a breath of it.You left him on him.And in the uniqueness of the ritual: the competitor is the same as the similarity to the most virtuous and the sake of them, without the insertion of harm to others, and it is in this sense, and it is the meaning And the difference between it and between the envy is more hidden from it, and that is formed that is related to the fact that the emotion of the emotion is obligated to the emotion; As it is possible and "let it be in it." And I answer that it is able to say the saying; That is, they say to the severity of the pleasure from other than that of that: let them compete with those competitors, that is: in the world in the sense that it was the righteous in them, and it is that they were in them.Speech on the ability of the condition of the condition, and the loyalty is signed in its answer; That is, if I want to compete with that of those competitors, and the custody is presented to be compensation for the condition in the occupation of its partner, which is the same.
