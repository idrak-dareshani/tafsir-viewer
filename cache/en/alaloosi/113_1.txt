The Quranic researcher Al -Falaq is an angel in the saying of goodness, giving, generosity, Jabir, and a kind narration from Ibn Abbas, a civilian in the saying of Ibn Abbas And a group and a group, which is correct; Because it is due to its descent, the magic of the Jews, as it will come if God Almighty wills, and they are sacrificed upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, as it came in the chapter, so it is not true for it, so it is not valid.An angel, as well as the words in the surah of people, which is the fifth, without disagreement.And when he explained the divine matter in the surah before it came with it after her explanation of what is forbidden by God, the exalted from the evil that is in the paths of the world and the paths After that, it was descended with the evidence of the pepper.So, Qarna, with what they have been blessed with in which the name of the two refugees, and the conquest of the conquest with “Say: I seek refuge.” A Muslim, Al -Tramidhi, and Al -Nasa’i, were brought out, and others were about him.He said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: (P-279) Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash, and say I seek refuge in the Lord of the people." Al -Bukhari, Abu Dawood, and Al -Nasa’i and Ibn Majah were brought out, “On the authority of Aisha, that the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was upon his bed, and he was all the night of his night.He read to them: “Say: God is one of the people, and say I seek refuge in the Lord of the Clash, and say I seek refuge in the Lord of the people.He accepted his body, doing that three times." It was stated in the hadith that those who read them with the Surah of the Survival are three times when he touches and three times when he becomes enough for everything.In their virtue, there are many news, other than what was mentioned.And on the authority of Ibn Masoud that he denied their Quran.Imam Ahmad, Al -Bazzar, and Al -Tabrani and Ibn Merdawi were brought up from a correct way from him that he was rubbing the two of the Muhsin from the Qur’an: From it; They are not from the book of God Almighty, but the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, commanded him to seek help from them.Ibn Masoud was not read by them, Al -Bazzar said: Ibn Masoud was not followed by one of the companions, and it was true of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.And it was proven in the Mushaf.Imam Ahmad, Al -Bukhari, Al -Nasa’i and Ibn Hibban, and others, were narrated from Zir Bin Habish.I saw the son of Masoud, who did not write the two mourners in his Qur’an.God Almighty, peace be upon him, and what they asked about them as one of them asked you.We say as the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said.The miracle is not distinguished by the Qur’an, and it was not different in it, and you know that the consensus has been fell on the Qur’an.Ibn Masoud returned from that, and in the explanation of the stances that the disagreement of the companions in some of the Qur’an is bitter with the unique ones of the murdered, the one who is the one who is the one.The beneficial to the two who are in the way that the suspicion is in its interview, so the one is what is not satisfied with it, then if we are grateful to them, then they are not mentioned in our words: We will go to the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, or in his manifestation in the rhetoric, the limit of miracle, but rather in the inventory of his void of the Qur’an, and so that he does not harm.It is ended.This is reflected in the two wounds.Muhsaf Abi bin Kaab and in the Muhsaf of Ibn Abbas and in the Muhsaf of Ibn Mas'oud, then if it is true that the words of God are the highest of the recitation of the recitation of the Qur’an.In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Six and separated as he prevailed in all the possibilities of the possibilities, so he is the Almighty, and he closed the light of finding from it, so that it comes out of origin, such as the eyes of the mountains, the rains, from the rains and the rains of The womb, and it was special for the sacrifice, and their release, the one who has been with it with their saying, so God Almighty for the night of the morning, on the authority of the day With their saying: I was slaughtered from the sheep and its interpretation in the general sense that Ibn Jarir and Ibn al -Mundhir and the son of Abu Hatim were narrated from Ibn Abbas.The creation.The darkness is a narrator on the authority of Jabir ibn Abd Allah, Mujahid, Qatada, Ibn Jabir, and Al -Qurtubi and Ibn Zaid, and upon him, then he will know The alarm about the light is the opposite of the darkness and the capacity after the distress, and the fear after the pity is a generous number with the forgiveness of the gossip from what is from it and the success of it (p-28) To his hope for reminding some of his organs, and more desired to him in the skin and acquisition by killing the door of the resort to him, glory and glory, and it was said: that in the Because it is emerging from the Day of Resurrection, the role is like graves And sleep is the brother of the death, and those who are free from their homes are morning of those who go to freshness and pleasure, and among them are those who are demanding a debt in dignity and evils to the lord It is the same thing that is what they have in the restoration, and in the interpretation of the judge: The Lord has preserved here and falls from the broker of the names, that is, the one that is permissible to add it to the closer is what was said to the lock.District, and it is on the blindness of the closer, it is a phenomenon of its inclusion of the one who is sought after, and it is for the sake of the good, and it is forbidden to be.For the axis of anxiety for phases, it will remove the domain and the dysfunction.And the president, Ibn Sina, said after the lap was carried over the injustice of the uniform nomadic with the light of the existence: that the Lord is a pleasure is a pleasant one of the truths of the knowledge; This is that the rabies do not seek any of its cases from the Lord as he sees in the child as long as it is a master, and when the places that are unable to do so are the one who is the one who is not able to.There is no maturation of the words of the Lord to refer to that and in which there is another sign of the hides of the sciences; It is that the goodness and the abundance in the language are a phrase for the resort to others, so when he was commanded to repeat the resort to others, and he was expressed by the Lord, that is the one who is the one who is the same He returns to the one who is referring to the abundant for goodness, but rather a matter that refers to its capacity; It is decided that it is nothing of the tuitions and others are leveled by it from the side of the first principle of its grace.His acceptance to him, which is the meaning of the Nabawi sign: It is clear that the softening of the roll is permanent, but the vulnerability is the end.And in a narration from Ibn Abbas also and a group of companions and followers that the closing is a forehead in hell.And Ibn Merdawi and his father, on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr ibn al -Aas, said: I asked the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, on the authority of God.By the Lord of the Clash, he said: “He is a prison in Hell, in which the Mabareans are held in which the people and the arrogant are, and if hell will seek refuge in God Almighty.” And Ibn Mardawi was brought out, “On the authority of Amr ibn Ansaba, he said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Do you know what the closer?"I said: God and His Messenger know.Hell.Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim were removed from Kaab, who said: The lock is a house in Hell, if it is opened, the people of the fire shouted from the intensity of his heat.And on the authority of Al -Kalbi that it is a valley in hell, and it was said: He is hell, and he is in what is in The scouts of their saying are when I have been brought up from the earth and the gathering is a peak, as creation and creation, and specializes it with remembrance, it is said that it is the right of the people; So, some of the companions was that he came to the Levant, so he saw the role of the people of the dhimma and what they are in the redundancy of livelihood and what was expanded by them from their world, and he said: And it was interpreted as it was narrated as a play.And among them who had magiced the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the knowledge of the Lord of the Lord, added to him a generous number of his goodness, peace be upon him.It is not hidden that this is what does not get the chest, and I think the weakening of the loud news and is likely in my view of the first meaning of the closer.
