The researcher, the example of which is the guarantor of his “with him” in his saying, is glorified and exalted: So they are in it, that is: it is a group in that time in this time.It was presented in his “Bae” before it, and it was also permissible as the vowel of the slope of the signing and the math of the prestige, that is, it is a richness of the rituals of what is not, or it is a gathering, or it is a gathering If I want to have dust and exile, as in the guidance of the significance of the pursuit of after each of them, it was before it, so the gathering of the gathering is overlooked by The enemy is enemy.Abu Huwa and Ibn Abi Ubah read: “So they were influenced” and “Fawsan” with the tension of the second and the Sunnah.And Ali, the generosity of God Almighty, read his face and Zayd ibn Ali and Qatada and the son of Abi Lali, the first as the masses, and the second is two.The meaning on the first tightening, so they appeared in it with dust because the influence in it has the meaning of purification and on the tightening of the second on what is presented.They were said that they were light and frightened by one meaning, and that they are two languages.Ibn Jinni said: The meaning is balanced by it; That is: (p-217), they made it two parts, i.E.Two divisions and two sides.Al -Zamakhshari said: The tension is in it to be prepared and the B is increasing to confirm, as it is in the words of the Almighty: It is exaggerated in: (Satan), and it is permissible to be a heart of Tharn to Wathran, then the wow turned a gossip.On the authority of Al -Saddi and Muhammad bin Kaab and Ubayd ibn Amir that they said: The orders are the camels, they are a sacrifice from the definition to the dawn to al -Muzdifah.And he was attributed to Ali, the generosity of God Almighty, and Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Al -Anbari were brought up in the book of Al -Adadad and Ibn Mirdawi and the one who said: While I am in the stone sitting, when a man came to me, and he asked me about (the orders, a sacrifice), and I said: The horses when you are deceived in the path of God, and then you will come to the night, then they will come to the night.Their fire, and he turned away from me, and he went to Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, while he was sitting under the authority of Zamzam.He said: Yes.I asked about Ibn Abbas.He said: It is the horses when it is deceived in the path of God, and he said: He went to me, and he called it to me, and when I stood up to his head, he said: You will not know what you know, and for you, and for you, and for the people, and for you, and for you, and for the people, and for you, and for you A conquest in Islam is a look, and it was only with us, a horse for the Zubayr and a horse for the one who is the son of Al -Aswad, so how the ordinary will be a sacrifice?Rather, the raids are the same as the camels from the coffin to the clouds, so if it is paid to the ritual, the fires.The seductions are from the dirt to the one who is a group.As for the saying of the Exalted: He influenced it with a fall, so it is the fall of the earth when it is slowed down With her wedding.Ibn Abbas said: I was removed from my saying to a saying to me, the generosity of God Almighty, and may God be pleased with him.His response was formed, as God is the Almighty.Badr, nor that the Surah came down in the matter of that conquest, so that it is necessary to achieve that in it and its income under the general They are prepared in the path of God, glorified and exalted, and if you are pregnant with the covenant.It was said: The bodies are the horses that the prayers and peace of God sent to the conquest of what you heard the chest As a secret, and he used to be the one who was the one who was the one who was a curse, and he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, slowed down, so he said, and he said: So the surah revealed a news for him, peace and blessings be upon him, with his peace, and his evil, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.He wanted him that the invasion of Badr is the best of the conquests of Islam and its bird, in which there is no words, so it is not possible that it is not intended.In the verse, what is appropriate for it from the questioner is not hidden, and it is not hidden that this answer is not carried out for the increase in the weakening of the temptation to it and the release of the normal of the enemies of the ideas, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the same He has the authority of the ruler of the rulers of the ritual of the ritual in it, and that it is not considered, then the transfer of it is the one who is satisfied with it.Out of what was presented to the argument of the arguments.And the owner of the interpretations quoted that he honored God Almighty, and he made it easy to appear, and that the son of Masoud is the one who made it easy for the camels.It is more likely that the will of the horses is that the excitement of the soaks is more than it in the camels, then that the news requires that the division of it is naughty; Emoking, camels, and group of invaders, or veiled wigs, a fire for their food or its surroundings.In some of the effects of Ibn Abbas, it is the most explained by what was presented in the interpretation of the Mauritus with what the ordinary seduce of the same in the sea is from it that it is the group of the fire She needs her and her food.And in an other narration from that, the group of invaders abounded by the fire, and the seduction was narrated from others as well.So, on the authority of Mujahid and Zayd ibn Aslam, and it is an other narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas, it is the group that is a deny in the war, for the Arabs say if you want the one who is the one who is the man The strange thing is that it was narrated from Akrama that it is the Sunnah of the men, the fire is the greatness The falsehood.It is as you see.And from the cores and references that (P-218) shall be divided into normal souls, as they are like the Mauritanians with their ideas, the lights of knowledge and the consequences of the habits and the customs of the people, if it appears.Jerusalem, and they influenced him, and they were so longing for those who are a collection of the top of the high.And the same is what was said: That is an oath of the gossip that is prepared in the path of God, the exitary of the exit from the woven of its craftsmanship, the voice of the supplication from the severity The spiritual people hear the fold of its supplication, its loss, and its pleasure The one who relies on the stone of the governing time and the deceased and the seductions after its hearts in the mountains of the righteous gossip in the darkness of the gap and the transit of it to the world of Pass the breath on the souls and its affairs, so that they are involved in that flee A collection of the soldiers of the hearts and the male male party that is the party of the Most Merciful in the middle of the world of the soul and for them in this section other than that.Whatever it was, what is divided by it
