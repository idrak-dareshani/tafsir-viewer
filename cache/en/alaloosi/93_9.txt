The Quranic researcher, as long as the Yatim, do not fill it, do not humiliate him as Ibn Salam and close to him said the saying of Mujahid: Do not be induced.And Svyan said: Do not oppress him with the sake of his money.In its meaning, what was said: Do not overcome his money, and perhaps the piety to take into account the majority and the first to carry the cursing of dominance and humiliation, and what is wrong with what is meant Participated in its meanings on the saying of his buds, and in the unilateral unilaterals: the oppression of dominance and humiliation with all, and it is used in each of them, and the son of the son is read And Abraham Al -Tayami: "Do not be more phenomenon." In the same way, it is not in the seed, and it is meaningful in the sea: so do not be more fierce.And in the distress of Al -Azhari: the hatred, the abundance of the face of the face, and the abundance of disgrace, and the choice of some of them here is its middleness, so the meaning is not in the face of it, and it is not the same You have heard from its meaning from the first door, and whatever it is in the verse is a sign of the acquisition with the time of the Yatim.And on the authority of Ibn Masoud Marifa: “Whoever wipes over the head of orphans, has every poetry that he has gave birth to the light of the day of resurrection.” And on the authority of Omar, may God be pleased with him, also a light: Yatim (P-164), whose father was absent in dust?And the angels say: You know.And God Almighty says: O my kingdom, I testify that I have for those who have been silent and satisfied with him to satisfy him on the Day of Resurrection.So the age of God, may God be pleased with him, if he saw a time, wiped his head and gave him something, and he did not correct in the way that he wiped out something, and the narration is from the authority It was said.It was narrated from him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.However, this is from the news.
