The Quranic researcher, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.Rabat; Because it is the beginning of the beginning in the meaning, and the secret of its export with the alert from the first matter on the rawness of its guarantees with the increase in the increase and the investigation; For the guarantor is not understood from the beginning of the matter except for a vague thing that has a dangerous danger, so the elderly remains sought by what is in front of him from what he explains, and he will be done.When he has a righteousness for him, he will be able to be able.And Sheikh Abd al -Qahir said in the evidence of the miracle: He has with him, "" Well, but it is not valid, without a Muslim.Yes, Al -Shihab Al -Qasimi said: This is a problem that if the news is made in the sense of the meaning of the sentence shown in the section That the phenomenon is that this group is not the matter, but the affairs are the sentence of the sentence that is a paradise; I mean the Haddani, and if the two sentences are made, which is a single, then the one who is associated with the one who is informed of it is summarized by (P-270).For every sentence like that; Because the news must be united by the beginning according to the self, and it is not limited to it, only those who are included in the sentence that is unique.I answer the choice of the first part, as it is guided by their expression of this guerrilla, sometimes by adding the story, the harm of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The story is with its cursing in the chapter of the case, and they are also preparing the same as his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: You were given, nor given what you are forbidden, and the grandfather is not beneficial to you.From the sentence that is the eye of the beginning in the meaning that is not needed to the guerrilla of that, and it is known that it is said: the two who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same They are obligated to break the thumbs, after the saying, and so do their dedication to it with my bridge: God is my account and sufficient; That is: my humanity, which I have been subjected to; As it appears that what we have been subjected to is the sentence in the known meaning, and the words of the son of Malik were indicated in Al -Tasheel on what is intended to be the one who does not need to be It was reported that it is a sentence, and it is a phenomenon, as we say it too, and that is, that is, a great thing: great from the affairs by adopting what is included in the words, And his interview with this adult is great.And the science of Ahmad Al -Ghanimi said: If I want to appoint him, according to the concept, it is a problem for the goodness The concept is as it is a walk The impulses with its merits, it is said: It is also a problem; As the guarantee of the one who is the best of the “God is one of the“ God is one ”and the private is not carried over the year in the total issues, and the lawsuit of partiality in this denomination is that they will not be blessed with it.About.And with another excitement, which is: What is true for the guarantor of the person is a uniqueness, and the sentence is not accompanied With a sincere individualism on the beginning to correct its fall, and the commitment to that in the exact sentence is a news about the guarantee of the affairs that contradicts it, and it will be unjust to them.It was on its location.It is answered that the meaning of their saying: It is the guarantee of the matter that it is a referendum that is returned to it, and a subject is subject to it, and if he did not precede the remembrance of the one who is a remembrance of the time Where it is evaluated every one, and it indicates every indication, and on it every guarantor will return, and their saying in the count of the conscience, which returns to a delayed and a delay of it.The affair is that it is returned to the sentence after it is forgiven.Because the two things are the one who is intended for it, then the righteousness of the destiny is with his eyes, the truth of the affairs, which he returned to him, and he is the choice The graceful affairs are a claim and make the judge a counterpart: this is more, or that the total meaning and make the judgment are not in the power of the judge, and it is in the power of the judge, and it is in the power of it.It was said: Some of God is one.The dignity that claimed to allow them came to him from the time of the one who appointed some before the remembrance of the sentence and its pregnancy is upon him and what was chanted by the one as well Let you be here, and the first is glorified, and the entirety of the whole is a vagina: all of the hunter in the welfare of virginity.As you see, let him refuse.And they won that it is the guarantee of the responsible for it, or the one who is required, or its attribution; Imam Ahmad has been brought out in his chain of transmission and Bukhari in his ways, and Al -Tarmahi and Al -Baghwi in his glorification and Ibn Asim in the Sunnah and the ruler, and he corrected it from the authority.The polytheists said to the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: O Muhammad Ibn Jarir and Ibn al -Mundhir and al -Tabrani in the middle and al -Bayahqi in a good bond and the last of Jabir said: “Arabi came to the Prophet, peace be upon him Forget your Lord, and God Almighty revealed: Say: God is one of the “etc.In the teacher, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, “Amer Bin Al -Tafil and Rabbad Bin Rabiaa, the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: They said: He described it to us.Reddied or from wood?So this surah was revealed, and the family of God is upset, and he was obstructed by the obedience.The Prophet (P-271) came to the Prophet (P-271), and peace be upon them as the son of the son of Al-Ashraf and the son of Ibn Akhb And the two liquids are narrated from the laughter and the son of Jabir and a murderer and a fight, and it is an apparent that the surah is civil.Its remembrance is in it and it is a beginner, and the generous name is his news, and "one" is a news after a news.The permissibility of the denial of the knowledge, and that it is a beginner, omitted, and that is one.A flag sanctifies the obligatory supports, as the people of the Ash'ari were gathered in, and others are different from the disgraceful, where they said: The knowledge is in the right of his right to the right of it.The same is the highly specialized in the privileges until it is placed for him, but he is known for the total concepts, which are associated with a single, so the memorial will be the same The whole is not a knowledge, and he responded that he is the highest scholar with the same characteristics, so it is permissible to place a note of his visits with his own, so he is a knowledge of this The place is God, an apparent, but it is necessary for it to be the understanding of God, as it is not possible for him.On this estimation, and saying that it is permissible for the perfect concept to be a machine for the place and the place will be the subject that is the one who believes in it.As it was said in this and his organizations, it is necessary for him to be the invalidity of what is not understood from it.The angels have to be peace as well as the same as the same as his self The Great is a sign of the extent of the universal right of the divine attributes of the divine, the rituals of the rituals that are alienated by the struggles of the fact, and the flag of the flags of the flag He passed by the first book, he returned to him.The well -known one, if one is informed of the child of his son, then he called him more, for example, without seeing him, it will be That is a name for the imaginative images that were obtained in his imagination, and then if he was not the birth of this surah, it was not the same That is the place, and if it was said that it is a synthesis of the total understanding in that individual, it was not aware of it as it preceded.Then, if we hear a flag from those personal flags, and we did not see its name in the first place, then we do not understand the property that it is, but maybe it is from it The pictures, or that all of those empty pictures are subject to it, so that it will be from the one who is shared by the shared between the causes of it.The property that is on it is only for it, so it will be other than it outside the place, so it will be, so it is one other than it from the thief The flags are partisan parties, and it is said: It is the implications of the comprehensive concepts, which are associated with the individual, or the obligatory of the other, both of the other, the end of the other, and the end of the other.Reconciliation as you see and contemplating.And "one" said: Its proliferation is a predecessor of waw, its origin, the limit, and the replacement of the dead waw, a little gambling, and its saying: a woman.They want: builders.Because it is from the brown, which is the brightness, and this is with the difference of one of the one who adheres to the negation and its part.The general person is intended as he said: “One of you is a needy one for him,” and he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: And the Almighty said: Do you feel from them from one of them, and his two sayings: Do not call with God one of them, and his saying is glorified and exalted.It was said: The hammer has originality, such as the prodigy in the other, and the difference between them said: On the way of meeting and shedding: What is in the house (P-272).That is: neither one nor a two, no, as a group, not groups, nor dispersed, and for this, his resignation was not valid in the evidence, because the denial of the opposite is valid and not correct.If it was said: In the house is one of the most, one of which is a single, with the proof of what is on one of the two, and those who are separated, and that is the apparent of the referral, and the one who is the one who is not.It is true that it is said: There is no virtuous.And the verse is mentioned.And who is used to prove three faces: the first is to be included in the twenty -one: one of the twenty, one and ten.The second: that it is used in addition or an addition to it in the first sense of the first, as in the words of the Almighty: As for anyone, he will be watered by his Lord with wine and their saying: the day of the one; That is, the first day.The third: to use divorced and description, and that is only in the description of God Almighty; And if it is one of its origin, it is only that One of him is used in the other hand, the one who said the saying of the nap: ؎ As if my Rahm and the day remained in us with the generosity of the one who is forbidden.And Maki said: The origin of one is one, so they replace the wow, and it gathered the mouths; Because the hampered is similar to the thousand, so they are deleted.He separated a fox between one and one; That no one is not based on the number, so it is not said: one and two times as it is said: one and two, and it is not said: a man is one as it is said: one man, and for you, and for you Some of them are also that one in the negation is a text in the general, with the difference of one, for it is an innervated for the general public and otherwise, so it is said: there is no one in the house, and it is not said.It is permissible to say: There is no one in the house, but rather, and we are transferred from some of the Hanafis that he said in the separation between them: The limit does not undertake the part of the part.It takes it; Because it is said: one hundred, and one thousand, and it is not said: one hundred is only one thousand, and it was built on that of the question of Imam Muhammad ibn Al -Hasan, who is the one who mentioned it.For a man of four women, he said: And God is not close to one of you who became a whole of them all, and it is not permissible for one of them to be close to them except for the disbelief, and he said: He did not become a baby only from one of them and the Bayan to him.Al -Khuta’bi separated that the limit is to uniqueness of the self, and the dedication to the exile of the partnership in the attributes, and we are transferred from the investigators, the separation, and the dignity of you It is the highest of the two of the two things from the other, it was said: The one is the one in the ruling of one name Al -Amash: "Say: He is the One God." And it is interpreted by what is not fragmented or divided.And some of the deadlines said: The one is saying on what is under it by skepticism, so what is meant by it is where the description is divorced with the one who is not the one who is not from it What is the one who is the same from the parts of the installation and the number is out of it, and what is required is that one of them is the bodies, the bias, the partner and the shame in the truth, the right of the ritual The subtle capacity and the complete rule that is required for the royalty, and it is taken from the words of the president, Abu Ali ibn Sina in his interpretation of the wine, who said: On the one that one of the all the faces, and that there is no abundance there is origin, not a large number of merits, and it is the most essential, and the chapters, the chapters, and the many parts A mind, as in the material and the image, and the sensual abundance of strength or by act as in the body; Thus, he will be included in his bench And the members, forms, colors, and walking of what the full one and the simplicity are appropriate to the generosity of the generosity and the face of the face of the glory of it, and it will be exalted.Ibn Aqil al -Hanbali said: He who is correct for us from the saying with the proof of the characteristics that it is one of the highest in his divinity.And others said from the two sons, such as the Hafiz Ibn Rajab: He is his single grace in his divinity (P-273) and his grapes What his grace responded to him from the adjectives that the perfect one is the one.And that is on the two guys: the universe of the guy for the affair and its universe for the one who is responsible for it, and it is not correct that the one is intended to be numerous in the first place; As the words are given to him from the good.And some of them mentioned that the generous name indicates all the attributes of the Khamal, which are the formal attributes.It is also said to be the characteristics of the generosity.One indicates all the qualities of the majesty, which are the negative attributes, and the words are included in their eyes, the news of the news that the one who is responsible for it is in the authority Celebrity and tales.It is followed by the fact that the divine is a gathering of all of that, but every one of the good names, as well, because the identity is a divine, and it is not possible for it to express it to it Because he is, and he explained that identity with a balance of it, and a negative, and the name of God is the transgression of all of them.It is a sign of his vastness, and God will be granted to him; Therefore, therefore he was punished with him, and the words of the president calling for that and we will refer to it if God Almighty wills.And the servant of God and Abi read: “He is one of the“ God ”, and they have agreed on that it is necessary for them to say: Say, O infidels, and do not go in“ Surah of the disbelievers, the hardship of the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, or his ransoms upon him, peace and blessings be upon him, and like that, it is appropriate for him to be of God.Because he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, is a matter of warning and jihad, and the “Tabbah” fence is a replacement of my father, a flame, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, peace and blessings be upon him.He commanded that his confrontation with him, and he is his uncle, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.Last.It was said in the face of “Say” in Surah Al -Kafirun: There is nothing that is not correct to be of God Almighty: I do not worship what you worship, so there must be a remembrance of “Say”.Because his remembrance is not necessary with this memory, so they understand.Al -Dawali said in the face of leaving “Say” in “Taba”: It is not far from being said: The saying of the wives of my father is a flame if he is from God, he was inserted into his dignity.It was said: It has a symbol that he is for his uncle May God’s prayers and peace be upon him not to be insulted by the same as these words except the one who created it;
