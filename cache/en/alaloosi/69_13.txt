The Quranic researcher, if it is blown in the pictures, is a single blow to the same as the same as the right and how it is, and its occurrence is the same as the greatness of its affairs with the kings of it.What is meant by the one blow is the first blow that the world was raised as Ibn Abbas said.The son of the sinner and a fight said, which is the last blow, and the first is the first because it is the appropriate one, even if the waw does not indicate the prohibition, but it is not the opposite To him and the blowing, the neighbor of God said in my footnotes as his scouts: the time and its significance on the blowing is an agreement other than what is meant and the greatness The fall of the blow one time, not from where it is a blow, so he stimulated it with the saying of his two tribes.And on the authority of Ibn Al -Hajib that a blow was not placed on the same time, but it was placed for the significance of the breath and the significance of the one who is the same It is followed by the fact that this is after the surrender, it is not harmful because the words are in the requirement of the place, not the origin of the place.It has been decided that the one who has the words made it made a long -standing until it was otherwise = it was ranging, so the time is the one who looked at the place without the sect without the nose, and it was not The appearance of the word requires the opposite.Whatever it is to support the verb to a blow that is not from the action of the verb to the affirmative source, it is a warning = a coercion, and if it is not noticed after the saying of it Remember the verb to the separation and the universe of the righteous, other than my right, and it is a source of etiquette.It is considered a person to be interpreted by the fact that the verb and the most famous is that one is a certain lobe, and it is released by some of them to confirm, and some of them are the good and the good.Like the bond, the compassion of the Bayan, and the adjective, a pyramid of the face of the rumor, with the hearts of the suffering and the completeness of the words in that in the long.And Abu al-Samal = Al-Samal "read a single blow" by setting them on the establishment of the neighbor and the pilgrims (P-44) the position of the actor.
