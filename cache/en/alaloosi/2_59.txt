The Quranic researcher, who did wrong, have said that they were not said to them, that is, to change those who did wrong with the saying that was said to them, and he said: One of them with himself, the other is with the same, and he enters into the municipality, so the vilification is augmented, and the father of the survival has been permitted to be (a replacement).He said, etc., and saying that (other) is a tendency to dismiss the rejectionist as if it was said: they changed a saying otherwise, without the satisfaction of the saying With the sacrifice of the inclusion of the trusteeship, it will be achieved for their violations, and it is meant by the extent of all aspect Those who are unjust, and that the oppressors are those who have changed, and if the substitutes were all, the place of that was from the place of the apparent placement of the place of the sake of the poem in the interest in the heart, They changed it, in the two correct ones that they said: a love in a poetry, and the ruler narrated a bowl in the manner of a cow, and in the teacher: they said with their tongue: They said that is a mockery of them with what was said to them, and the narratives are in that many, and if it is correct, the disagreement of the righteousness will be carried on the disagreement of those who say, and the saying is that it is not (So ​​they changed) They did not do what they were commanded, not that they came to him, and it is not a Muslim, and if the father of a Muslim said it, and the appearance of the verse, and the hadiths of it, then it is Those who have been shaded in the sky of the sky as they were soaked and put the appearance, the position of the groaning, exaggerated in the praise of their affairs Suffice them by leaving what requires its grapes, or put them in the way that is affected by it, in which its position is due to the removal of the ritual, which is the torment, and the brokenness of its opinion, and the guarantee, and the guarantee, and the guarantee, And by the reader of Ibn Muhaisn, and what is meant by it is as it was narrated from Ibn Abbas: a darkness and death, it is narrated that he died from them at four hours, and he said: Four nights, and then they died after that, and Ibn Jabir said: Thorns perished by him from them seventy thousand, for if he was interpreted, it was from the dawn of Other than that, it is a sign of the side from which the judiciary, or exaggeration in its highness, with the sacrifice, and the evacuation, and the one who investigated, mentioned some of the investigators that the neighbor and the neighbor are not.He signed a row for a struggle, and what they were spoiled, attached to him, because of his clothes from the worker, a cause for him, and the word (what) is a source of our injustice, and the meaning is: The oppression of their oppression is an estimated torment in the cause of their being, who are dominated by immorality in the past time, and this is the first one to make the neighbor and the boundaries a difference of the ritual To show it on the path of the sayings, and not to need to be removed from immorality after the explanation The one who is used to comment by the darkness to the saying that immorality is the eye of darkness, and repeated to confirm And they described them with the darkness and described the immorality of the then of its being from the cabares, because the first is the one who is the one who is unable For the darkness, the landing of the torment is caused by the injustice that is caused by immorality, not something, as their injustice is the one who is a precedent, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is Some people were transmitted with the words of His Excellency: (He changed), etc.Another memorial, and a people said: It is permissible if the second word is the first one, and on this, the dispute is ran, as in the sea in the Qur’an in the Qur’an, and the meaning of the Qur’an, The proud of the warning, and in the permanence of marriage with the memory of the gift, the sale, and the dependence, and the search is detailed in its place, this is the remembrance of the Lord of the Imam.This verse was mentioned in the norms with a violation of the faces of the jokes.After the permission of the permissibility with it, the second: He said here: Enter and there, I lived because the income is presented, and therefore it was presented and the submission of the old one said: With the group of many, when he added that saying to itself, and the fears of the existence of many sins, and there is your sin with the gathering of the few Al -Rabaa: He said here: Ragge without there to the verb’s chain of transmission to himself here, so it is appropriate to mention the great year, and the support of the chain of transmission is there.Fifth: He said here: “Enter the door in prostration and say a cow, and there is the opposite, because the waw is to divorce the collection, and also the addressees, it is necessary for them to be.And some other things were like that, so the sinner must be of his assumption by the degradation of sins provided for his abuse of worship, so there is no crime, and it was a crime, it was a crime, and it was the same Power, then enter, and who is not a sinner, then the first one is to work first with worship, then he reminds the second, for the second, for the sake They must enter, and then say, when he carried the fact that those who address are divided into the two sections, not a crime (P-268), it is mentioned in all of them.Other, the sixth: He said here: We will increase the wow, and there is his body, as he made here the forgiveness with the Ziyah, one is one of the people of the one who is the same Permanently (power), and the leadership is the part of the income, so the leaving the waw benefits the distribution of each of the two parts of the two part From the two conditions, the seven: He said there: Those who have been wronged from them and here they did not remember them, because the first story is there is a building on the one who said: They guided the truth, and he specialized at the end of the words to be able to apply his first, and when he did not remember the verses before (so he changed) here is a distinction and a specialization in the end of the story.That, the eighth: He said here: So we descended and there, so we send us that the landing is beneficial to his entirety at the beginning In the last, the ninth: He said here: So eat in fulfillment, and there is the matter in “all of it is a righteous” which is that every verb has been overwhelmed by something, and the verb is the same With the home of the penalty, the second is the first of the fulfillment without the waw, so when the largest was attached to the entrances, it was said in the wall of the cow: so they did not, and what was not commented It was said: They were the adult: He said here: They are immoral and there are oppressors because it is when it was clear here, as the time of the immoral The wages are from the view, but in the first, second, eighth and adore, because it is valid if the cow surah is advanced on the wall of the naughty, as it is, as it is, as it is, as it is, as it is.Press, and not, for all the cow is a civilian, and the wall of all of them is an ancient, except for eight verses of his saying, and I ask them about the village.The mountains and say the mountain are the Almighty: they are forced this village within the anchor verses, so that the wrath is not correct, and what is mentioned, and what is mentioned, and what is mentioned in the male, It is for him to prevent the abode of the most of the silence, because if they live in the village, their silence will be caused to eat from it, as it was mentioned in the time, and they are not.We were raised, and eating from it, then there is no difference between (eat), and (eat), so the answer does not take place, and the third is because he is upset, even if he said in the nations: (and he said: The two surahs: (We forgive you), and the forgiveness added to itself, so the stability of that liability is not to be mentioned in the two walls.(We forgive you) or from the patronage (and when it was said to them) to suspend the forgiveness with the sins, as it is not hidden from the person with the benefits, but the lord is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the lord, It is the same, but it is a chain of transmission to it in the same matter, so we will remember the great year in the two surahs, and the fifth is because the story is one, and the story is one, Sins, and some of them are not guilty, on the authority of what is mentioned that he is mentioned to be mentioned and said a cowardly presented in the two chapters One, and the waw is to divorce the collection, and its saying is the Almighty (forgiveness) In the interview of (say), whether it was presented or the most late, and the Almighty said: (and we will increase) in the interview (and enter), whether it is mentioned by the waw or leaving it, and the one is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who mentioned Here before (he replaced) what indicates specialization and distinction, where his grace said: We have been blessed with you, and we have come to you, and we have come to you from the goodness of you.With the rhetoric of the speech, and its formulas, then the one who is time to remember (from them) also, and the correct answer is about all these questions, and what is what he said is what is not.It is not a matter of contradicting the two phrases, if there is no contradiction, and there is no contradiction between his words, the highest: Skind this village and say: So our silence caused them to eat from it, so they gathered in the presence between its railors and the eating of it, and whether they came to the cow on the entry of the door, or the one who finished it, then they are in the face Between them, and leaving the remembrance of the raft is not contradictory (P-269) its proof, and its saying is the Almighty: We forgive you for your sins, and we will increase the improvement, and the two people, The widening of waw is not disturbed because it is an arrangement that arranged for the estimation of the saying of the saying: What after the forgiveness?He was said to him: We will increase the good, and likewise increase (from them) the increase of Bayan, and we send us, and we descended, and they are oppressed, and they are immoral, from one house.And in the form of art in expressing, the abolition of the absence, in which there is a sign of the raising of the one who spoke to what is not hidden, and the Qur’an, is the one who is the one who does not.A secret for everything in which he has fallen from it, as he did not do what is not a way to it except with the correct revelation, and the religion of the religion, and God will give it to whom he does not, and whoever is blessed, and whoever is blessed, he.* * * And from the chapter on the reference in the verses: And when you said to the heart of the heart: we will not believe in the true faith until we reach the place of the witness, and the eyes, so I took you in the way, so I took you.The timid manifestation, and you watch, or witness, then we will send you a real life, and the survival after the death, so that you will thank you God is glorified and exalted, and we have been blessed with you, the adjectives of the adjectives for their being the veil of the sunscreen, the sacrifices of the sacrifices, and its face is what it ended with it, and it is for you, The college of the sweetness between the sweetness, and the domination of the ethics of the soul, such as trust, contentment, and the desirability of judgment, knowledge, and true sciences, which are good And the divine bodies in the end of the attributes with your hearts in it, so you will be shed with that peaceful, and forget from the world of the world, all that is unhappy, and they are not.These are the good women who have been given to you, according to your number Our rights and attributes of their enthusiasm with the affiliations of themselves, but they were deficient in the right of themselves with their deprivation, and their loss, and this is the loss This village, that is, the sanctuary, which is the place of the testimony, and enter the door that is the consent of the judiciary, for the chapter of God is the Almighty, the prostration of those who are blessed with those who are.The manifestations, and ask that God be transcended from you, the sins of your attributes, your ethics, and your acts, if you do that, we will be forgiven for you.I approached him as a arm, and whoever approaches a arm to me, I approached him with a sold, and whoever comes to walk, he will come to him, and we will increase the good, and no one, nor do you not see, nor do you not see the good.Ears heard, and there is no danger of human beings, and that is only the complete revelation of the sacred selfs, so those who wronged themselves changed themselves Its delegated place in it, a saying other than those who were said to have a luggage for the sacrifice of the mortal and the religious desires, so we descended on the oppressors, especially the people Prayer, and a family in the trustworthy of the wish, the restriction of passion, the deprivation and humiliation of the love of the lower material material The spirit, and the prevention of kindness and the sacrifice from them by their immorality, and their exit from obedience Al -Muftoun), to obedience to the soul that is bad.This is the great bilateral, and the generous rhetoric.Whoever wanted in peace, let him ever be from the thickness of the diseases of it.Dear it, as it is his richness and his richness.
