The researcher of the Qur’an from the people who says that we believe in God and the last day and what are the believers of this verse and what is after it to the last story of the story of the one who is given to the story of the story The two sympathizers are a marketer, except that they have an appointment on the people of misguidance, which is not hidden, and this verse has been given to three twelve verses of the people.They will be disbelievers, and they appeared in Islam, according to the appearance of the greatest of the maid of the disbelievers, as it indicates to it the words His origin is with his Sibu and the gathering people, and it is a group or the name of a group for a person, and his mourning has been relieved, so he weighs, and he is a good, and he is a person, And human beings, and its shortness and completion of it is brought, if it is denied, then if it is known, then the most is the shortage of it, and whoever knows is special in the evacuation, and it is permissible for it to be done, and it is permissible to do it.The loads are on the authority of people who are safe, and they are taken from the people against against the monster to forget it with his people, because it is a civilian, and it is a minimum The human being is only to forget it ∗∗∗ nor the heart except that it flips or from the people of any insight.A sensual, and the silence went to the fact that it is a complete name, and its eye is wow from Nawas, if it moves with the evidence of its minority on the nucleus, then it is the same, then it is the same, then it is the same The following is the difference of his arrogance, such as an enemy and a narration, and it was said: Whoever forgets the heart, because he said to him in Adam, peace be upon him: He did not forget him On the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, then he weighed him then a fabric, and it is not used in the majority except in the children of Adam, and he said from the son Abu Hayyan: It is a metaphor, and if it is taken from the Nawas, it will be the truth of the concept on the heaven, and it is not apparent, but if we say: The Nawas is the sacrifice of the thing in the authority of the He was rewarded that each of the people and people is independent and the blame is either for the Sans or for the external covenant, so if the first is, then it is a misfortune, if it is a good A communication that is intended by Abdullah ibn Abi, and his feasts, and the son of the son of Hisham and a group that will be connected to the estimation of the genius, and the sacrifice The covenant is that some of the sitting may be appointed to the face and some of those who are appointed, it may be ignorant, by adopting a state of his condition, as well as the people of the place He knows his eyes as a killer, and if he knows his person, there is no face to specialize in these, and it was said: The specialization is the lineage, for the sake of the sake of the sake of the The vengeance has a close relative, and some denial of denials, so it is appropriate for the advice of the doctor, and the matter of its disagreement is in The covenant, and on these pipes (P-144), his saying is redeemed: among the believers are men and who are those who hurt the Prophet because he wants in the first one and in the first place The second is a specific sect of hypocrites, and when it was in the verse, a detailed detail is because it is the one who mentioned the believers, then the disbelievers, then the disbelievers, then the one who is the disbelieve A counterpart of the discretionary separation, and in the strength of the detail of people to a believer, a disbeliever, and a hypocris Meaning: Whoever is afraid of the hypocrites is known to us, and if not for the one who is from the generosity, then it is sacrificed, so it will be beneficial as well, and it is wiped into a guidance, and it is said: One of the people is that they have no characteristic that distinguishes them except for the human image, or what is meant to be alerted is that the male attributes contradict the humanity, so it is liked to be from it Women, that is, they are the ones who are among them, or they are from people, not from heaven, as there is no hypocrisy in them, or what is meant by the Muslim people, and the meaning is that they are the ones who are.They dealt with them and to them, and there is no hide in some of these faces from the cost and cost, and for every drop of point, and the choice of the father of Hayyan, here is that it is from) Calling that it is a wool if it is located in a place that specializes in the den for the most, and otherwise there is little even that the silence is on the authority of it In it, and it is not mentioned on the will of the era that it is how the hypocrites enter the opposite in the infidelity of the Egyptians who are governed Those who disbelieved in the third section that vibrated, so he does not enter into it, because what is meant by the hypocrites designed from them, the deceased, as well Deafness is blind, and they do not return, not the divorce of the hypocrites, and because their choice with the mixing of deception, and the mockery with the infidelity, it does not contradict the entry of their entry.With this administer, they became a third section, for the division is a secondary, according to the truth, three with admission, and in its saying, the Almighty is: (He says) (and from us) And if the first took into account, then he said: I believed, or the second, then he said: They say, and when all of the good is the good of the memorial first, then it is in the outside, and it is in the way.Group, and if it is not permissible, Ibn Attiyah claimed that it is not permissible to return from a group to the neutrality, and the saying of the poet will not be said: The horses of the enemies were fulfilled and made from the consequences of faith to God, and the last day, with the fact that they believed in their mouths in all of what he came to the authority of God.Because they are intended The greatest of faith, for whoever believes in God is up to God who is worthy of the same as his writers, his messengers, and his parts, and whoever knows that he is to him The righteous, and therefore there is a notice of the pretext of possession of faith with its initial and re -drivers, and what is the mind of the mind and the hearing, and that faith is guaranteed, or that of the faith, or that By the remembrance of the atheism that they are infected with the disbelief in which they are not hypocrites in the sentence, because the people in the famous people were humiliated, and they are the one who is in the faith of the faith.The last of their thinking, and with that they were agreed in the way of faith in them, and the believers see that their faith in them is like their faith in the way The urbanization, and they will not believe in it in the first place, as the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him The Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him Acknowledgment of what God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him.The one who was on the beginning and the repetition, and recognized that they were in delusion, they specialized in their faith in that, because they were saying the captives of the origins, and the Prophet is not in the faith.Also, the righteous in the heart is left from what the fathers have to leave faith in him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him What is not likely that they are believed to him after their mastery of what is more severe than them, and he carried: God and the last day of the division of the division of the faith, and the one who is the one who is in the first place, and the last of them is from the division of the faith, From him, with the paths of his pregnancy on the oath from it, the exalted of their faith in appreciation, what they believed in and what they are believers, so that the bid is in the faith, and there is a prayer The service and the dressing by the purification that their faith is separate, affirmative, strong, and the last day is required that the permanent time is not for the time He attributed it to the stability of each of the believers and the infidels, as it is prepared for him, and he was called another, because he is the last of the limitations, and the most like is the first because the launch of the day He has in the Qur’an, whether it was a truth or a metaphor, and because faith in it includes faith in the second, for his entry into it, without the opposite, the blessings of the right, The second, for its limitations, and it is on all the estimated estimates because of the people because the day is known from the sun of suns to its sunset, and it is made from the rituals of the sun.The honest dawn to the strawberry, and the repercussions of the half of the day to the half of the day, and the matter behind that, and it will come to that to be fulfilled, and in the saying of it: The actor and the first letter of negation is a response to the pretext of those who spend on the most vulnerable to the face of the face, because their involvement in the believer is the one who is to be rewarded for the sake of the faith of the faith The obligation is the same as a witness to the abandonment of the obligatory, and it has been overwhelmed in the negative of the condemnation of the cosmopolis.The negation is also the casual, and this is the reason for the response from the response as they believed in the past of the priority Like the believers in the real faith and claim their agreement, it was said in their answer: and what are the believers on the shortcomings The general, and that they are not from faith in anything, and may restrict what he restricted by his priest because he is falling into his answer And confirm.In this verse, there is a sign of that whoever does not believe in his heart is not a believer, and as for those who acknowledged his tongue, and not in his heart, he will not be in his heart, and he will not agree Because the opponent is exalted here, because it is from the seal on his heart, or because God Almighty has lied, and only for the sake of the custody of the ritual, as well And some of them claimed, claiming that whoever makes faith is the linguistic justice, whether the immortality is involved in denial and denying, or does it not be involved in the abuse of the two, and the declaration is not.We have: I believed in God and the last day, because the path is on the authority of them as it was mentioned in the correctness until some of them were involved, and the most important, May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, so there is no evidence in the verse of the pharaohs, so that it is considered.
