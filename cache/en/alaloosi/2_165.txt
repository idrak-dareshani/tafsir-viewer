Because it affects the silence of the heart and holds it in it, and the love of worshipers to God - the Almighty - when the speaking of the speakers is a type of will, whether it is the same, whether we are the same To the obedience of the benefit as it is the opinion of the disgraced, or a desirable adjective, it is a stimulant for it, as it is the people of the Sunnah, so it does not get stuck with it, and it is not related to it, and it is not related to it Similarly - Human - the love of the servant to him - his grace - the will of his obedience and the acquisition of his diseases, and this is based on the confinement of the one who is in the pleasure, and the lord of the delicacy, And those who know God - Glory be to Him - they said: The talisman is also a love for itself, for the servant loves God - the Almighty - for its own; Because it is the absolute perfect that does not condemn it as his money as a talisman, and the love of his servants and his rewards is a descending arrangement, and the love of God - the Almighty - to the servants of the servants - Do not adapt, and do not dilemma, and it is said about its time, and it was said: the will to honor it and its recovery in the obedience and its voices from the sins, and what is meant by love and the love of it; That is, they settle between God - the Almighty - and among the extremist increase, so they glorify them and obey them as they glorify God - the Almighty - and they tend to obey Return to the clogging, so if the presidents want it clear, otherwise the expressions of it by adding the minds by adopting that falsehood that they are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one The reaction and its actor have their guarantee with the precedent of the remembrance, and the participants convert to it - the Almighty - and they resort to it in the hardships, and if you ask them, and if you ask them To say God, then if they ride in the ark, pray to God.Religion, and it was said: It is the back of the back, and the domestic of what is required by the time of a sentence that they love with a biar in the face of the face that it is the source of the son of the one He loves; Because it is not obligatory, and the meaning is likely to be liked to be the pharmacist from the part of the partners with his love - the exalted - on the authority of the believers, and there is no one who has the right.Those who believe in the most severe love for God; Because the likeness is between the two loved ones, and that requires that the love of the idols be the same as its lover - But by adopting the painting of one of them without the last, the intensity of the love of the believers is intensified As the love of the two people of their gods; Where they change from it to God - the Almighty - when the hardships, and they seek from it when the conversion of the horrors, and worship the idols for a long time As it is told: that the family had idols from a sense, so they were in drought that struck them, so they eaten them - and they have their father, for that he did not benefit from it.They have tasted the sweetest of the disbelief, and the intensity of the love is not intense and its strength in itself, so that we will see that we see the infidels, they come from the obedience of no The believers, how is it said: their love is more severe than their love, and from this, the face of a choice is more severe for the love of I love; For what is meant is the increase in the origin of the verb, but rather the painting and steadfastness, which is the angel of the matter; And for this, he descended: He took up as you were commanded and he loved the work to him - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - his blood, and Al -Alamah said: He justified (I love) to (more) Because he was popular in the most beloved, so (P-35) changed it from the confusion, and it was said: If I love more than love, then if it is a form of it (do).If those who have been wronged, that is, if he knew these people who have been wronged by the states of the remembrance; The phenomenon is placed in the position of the rented significance that this (the ritual) is a great injustice, and that the equitable of the one who is taken is known to it.Where he crossed from the divorce of the darkness, the connection and the prayer of the notification in the reason (their vision of torment), the concept of the saying of the one who said: Ean the torment prepared for them and see it on the day of resurrection, and he wanted the form of the receipt after (La) and (if) the one who is the one who is in the past, so that it will be fulfilled.Approximately acceptable, and the two sides.The power of all of God prevailed in the lion of Maafali (seeing), and the answer (if) is deleted to the atheism of the eternity of his exit from the Bayan's circle; That is: they fell from the sorrow and regret, while it hardly describes, and it was said: It is a comment.The answer, and the acts are deleted, and the appreciation: and if those who have been wronged, they will not be used, do not benefit, so that they may know that the power of God is all that does not benefit or harm.And the son of Amir, a beneficiary, and Aqboub, read: (see) that the rhetoric is for him - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - or for every one who reconciles for the speech, then the answer is: If you see something that is not described from the horror and the anger), and the son of Amir: (As they see) with the construction of the acting, and it is punished: (that) with the fraction, and that the God is the one who is the God Performing the saying;
