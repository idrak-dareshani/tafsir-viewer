The Qur’anic researcher has lost any of the presidents, many created many, that is, before these recommended that they hold the worship of idols, so they are not the first of those who are lost.And the ritual is where I feel that the misguidance was dominated by them to the time of the news by the misguidance The presidents are the one who addresses those who address his words, do not destroy your gods, and put a lot, putting on that on the way of excess.Al -Hasan said, and they have lost any idols, and it is like his saying, Lord زَعْمِهِمْ ويُحَسِّنُهُ عَلى ما في البَحْرِ عَوْدُ الضَّمِيرِ عَلى أقْرَبِ مَذْكُورٍ ولا يَخْفى أنْ عَوْدَهُ عَلى الرُّؤَساءِ أظْهَرُ إذْ هُمُ المُحَدَّثُ عَنْهم والمَعْنى فِيهِمْ أمْكَنُ And the sentence is said to be a state of status, or it is given to what is before it and the words of the people and the unjust but the misguidance was said.After (he said) and the deputy wow on his authority and his meaning, my Lord said that they disobeyed me and said and do not increase, etc.After that, the storyteller, and for him the gap of the time, but he committed that of the kindness of creation on the news..It was said that it is compassionate and the wow from the storyteller and the structure of the construction and the experience is not necessary in kindness as the father of Hayyan said and otherwise in it is a disagreement and in the man And he gave me a boredom [Mary: 46], that is, let them down and do not increase them, and in the aggressors to the unjust, a notice of their investigation of the supplication, and the righteousness of them, and for the sake of peace be upon them.And to be kind to others, in which some of the causes of their equality, which is a good means, has a good sense of the kindness of the one who is the one who is the first Lord, they are blindfolded and wow from the storyteller and the appropriateness..Al -Khafaji said: The phenomenon is that the abuse is from the saying of the Lord that they are the etc.It is a request for the victory over them, as the Lord, the Lord, will be victorious with what they lied to [smoke: 22] and if he did not mean that, he repeated with what he passed by It will be a manner from his saying, let them down, help me, or show your religion or like it, for it is the one who has the most comprehensiveness of creation, without the rest of it.Likewise, a supplication, as his two people said, and his Lord called that these people are criminals [smoke: 22] so he managed, and it is good, free from the cost and the time Diggling and meant by misguidance called for his leadership, either the delusion in the irritation of their compass With the end of their affairs, or the misguidance in the sense of destruction, as in the saying of the Almighty, the criminals are in delusion (P-79) and the price of (the moon: 47), which is from the one who is from the one who is from the This is lost in it, so the meaning will be their people.And Ibn Bahar explained it with torment, and he is close to what was mentioned and was said to him.Your people are only those who have believed and the supplication of the supplication to them with the increase in their torment and needs a sign, and what you heard is what is said that it is the request of misguidance, and it is a matter of misguidance, He was called on him on the face of the charitable and his body, and if it is permissible, it is other than the erased, and there is no satisfaction, so how is it called by the peace be upon him.
