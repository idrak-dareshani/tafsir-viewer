The researcher of the Quran, the Almighty: We created the human being, etc.And I want the human beings; It is an inclusion for the believer and the infidel, not the second, and he is inferred by the validity of the discretion, and that the origin is in it.And the Almighty said: In the best evaluation in the position of the situation of the human being; That is: a valuable evaluation is the best of evaluation, and the evaluation is the righteousness and the transgression, which is the action of God, glory and glory.With it, a counterpart of your saying: So -and -so in the consent of more.In the sense that he is satisfactory to him.Al -Khafaji said: It is a source in the sense of the residency or the person, in which there is an additional added; That is, the most good or "in addition" and after it in the position of the relevant active and the weapon in which the source has been described.And the appreciation: its residency is the best of the good, and it is intended to make it the best of what is a picture and a meaning, so it will include what he has from the one who has the ritual The sensitivity and the goodness of the mind and otherwise.And whoever curses his view in his matter and the deadlines of his thoughts in the privileges of his appearance and his secret, he saw him as he said some of the deadlines: The college copy of what is in the messages of the brothers of Safah and the brightest of the one who explains and explaining the ports of the gods of the divine miracle deposited in it for what was and will be the same Perhaps God has honored the Almighty and his face: Your bounties are in you and do not feel your feet from you and what you see.The best of his evaluation is that God Almighty has drawn from the characteristics of what his attributes remember his attributes, glory and exalted, and he deals with him, so he made him a murid scholar.And the Almighty said: "You created the creation of God, so that it is not deluded that what is of the master of the servant is forbidden." It is sufficient in this chapter, which is the chapter, that God Almighty created him with his hand and commanded His rituals, his angels, peace be upon them, with the prostration of him.It came that God Almighty created Adam on his image, and in a narration: on the image of the Most Merciful.It refuses to invoke the angel of the guerrilla on Adam in the sense of his creation, and it is not transmitted in the phases as his daughters and the universal copy of the copy.Yahya bin Muath Al -Razi said: He who knows himself has known his Lord.People claim it as a hadith and not - as the Nawawi said - with a reward.And on the authority of Yahya ibn Aktham and some of the Hanafis, they have avoided those who said to his husband: If you did not have a good one of the moon, then you are divorced with a long time, In a famous story.The poets have the way to precede their lover on the moon, a night, which is narrowed by the scope of the exclusivity, and the truth is that the difference is like a morning.
