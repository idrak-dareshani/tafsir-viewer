The researcher, when Abraham raises a kindness on the authority of the past, and he said, and he has the effect of the formula of harming with the fact that the story is a past, in order to bring this matter to this matter.Grand obedience with the dignity in its acceptance, and let them know the greatness of the building, and they will glorify it, the vehicles of the house are the gathering of the righteousness, and it is the basis of the basis, and it is the basis A row that has become dominant before the strict names, in terms of it is not mentioned for it, and it is not appreciated, and it is not appreciated by the slopes in the sense of stability, and perhaps it is a metaphor for the sake God Almighty, in the supplication, in the sense of your perpetuation, may God bless you, and raise the causes on this meaning, is a metaphor for construction on it, as the phenomenon of lifting the thing is high.He raises, but he remains in his condition, but he was not before the construction on him, and when he was built, he was transferred to the authority of me.That the body was built upon him, the construction has become a reason for the crops like raising, so he was used to raise the construction on it, and it is derived from that, and it is lifted.Building horses, and every leg is located because of what is above it, so what is meant by raising it on this is its own building, and the aspect of the group is on it, and it is the first, and the first is for the first, for the first A basis, and this saying was weakened by the fact that there is a cure for the memorization of the barriers of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same as the narration in the first, and it was said: Ra`fa, and the lifting of the lifetime, By the precedent, realistic, it is an acting boss, and it is a dimension, as it does not appear at the time of the remembrance of al -Quda’a, (and from) (Bayraa), or a state of life, and he did not say: the barriers of the house, because of the dignity and the evidentity of the useful, indicative of the disturbance that is not hidden.And hearing is a compassion on his brightness, and in his delay about the active act of a reference to him that his entrance is to raise the construction and work The income of his Abraham, peace be upon him, and he replied that he was carried out by the carpentry, and it was said: They were built in two parties, or on the bond, and the most important of them, Beginning, and his telling is deleted, that is, he says: Our Lord, and this is a mile (P-384) to the saying that His Excellency, peace be upon him, is the one who is alienated, and no Building on what was narrated on me, the generosity of God, the Almighty, and his face that it was a young child, and the correct one is that the effect is not correct, this is the one who mentioned this And his feet and his resurrection, and from anything that was his doorstep, how many times did Adam, and from anything that he built, is a wasting, and whoever helps him on his own The great Qur’an includes it, and no The authentic hadith, and some of it contradicts some, and that is on their habit in the transfer of what he has bear and drew, and from the most famous that the kaaba was descended from Al -Mashrah and Al -Maghrib, the pilgrimage of Adam from the land of the Indian, and the angels received four four firmness, so he wrapped in the house, and entered it, then he was raised in the Peace be upon the sky, then it was revealed again in the time of Ibrahim, and he visited it, raised its barriers, and made its door one door, then the father of Qabis, then it It was a white ruby ​​from the righteousness of Paradise, and Gabriel came down with it, so I was disappointed in the time of the flood to the time of its shores, and it was placed by his pioneer, then the place of the authority, then This is the news and its proverbs, if it is correct for the people of God, the transgression of signs and symbols of those who have the hearing while he is a martyr, so we will go down in the time of Adam, peace be upon him, to the reference And the knowledge of the world of light and the world of darkness in its time without the world of al -Tawihid, and its intention is its visits from the land of the Indian, pointing to its direction by its way Darkest body to the place of the heart, and the angels are drawn to the angels of the plants of the plants and the animal powers in the body, and the appearance of its effects in it before the effects of the hearts in the effects His structure was formed in it, and his clay was exaggerated, or he was directed by the water and the peace from the world of the unknown to the heart of the heart, and the heart of the heart, The philosophical and the physical of the acceptance of the ethics, the beautiful ethics, and the virtuous and transmitted communication, and the transmission in the positions before his prayers to the place of the heart, and the stomach of the heart, His prayers to the shrine of the heart and his hearts are in it with the telescopes, and its entry is a sign of its domination and its residence in it, and its raising it in the time of the flood to the heavens to the heaven With the dominance of the passion, the flood of ignorance in the time of Noah from the place of the heart, and its hatred in the sky to the perfect house, which is the heart of the world and its descent once in a time People in his time to the position of the heart with his guidance, and raised his signs and made him one of one door, indicating the hearts of the heart to the place of al -Tuhid, as it is the first of the The tale referred to him with his saying is a story about him: I directed and directed to the one who has broken the heavens and the earth is a hanger, and what I am among the participants and the stones of the soul is the reference to the soul of the soul.His affair, his right, and the position of his secret, and the abode of Abi Qabis and his inhalation from him a reference to his appearance with the whiteness and the sacrifice of the machines of the body with the inherent in the hearts of the body in the hearts In order to see it, it was said: I have been made by any of the body, and its supplies with the tip of the lives are a sign To confirm the dominance of the Nafiqiyah powers on the heart, and its lifting on it and its arrangement, the Nurani direction, which follows the spirit from it.And if the cat would be left for a night.Our Lord accepts from us, that is, they say our Lord, and with him a father’s reader, and the sentence is a state of an actor (he raises), and it was said: He is given to what he accepted by making the saying of the saying ( And the acceptance is metaphor for reward, and contentment, because every work accepts by God, the Almighty, so it is the reward of his owner and his pleasure from him, and in the question of the reward for the work of the evidence of it, it is a sign of it.Obviously, otherwise it is not required, and in the choice of the form of acting, it is a confession by the shortcomings because it is in the notification of the cost in the acceptance, even if it is the acceptance and the acceptance of the path, As it is not possible to cost in its matter, the glory of it, and it is possible that the one who is intended to be satisfied is only, without the reward, because what is not Those who are among the servants (P-385) to the fact that their actions are subject to acceptance and satisfaction with the servant, and the reward is not what is wrong with them, and this is the one who is in the mind of this And his son is the hearing of peace be upon them, you are the hearing of knowledge The one who benefits from the definition of the two supporters, and the exile of the hearing and the life in the supplication and the work that is the condition of the acceptance, and the confirmation of the sentence to purify it as the curtain of the power With its guarantee, and the adherence of the characteristic of the hearing, even if the question of the acceptance is delayed from the work of the successor, and because it is not like the knowledge.
